q1tat3,I saved a man’s life last night.,"Long post warning. 

Prior to the events of the rather wet and windy Monday night, I was relaxing on the sofa wondering why social media wasn’t working. 
For further context, I live right next to an old canal dock, 3 floors up. 

At approximately 11:20pm last night I heard a huge splash outside. Thinking it was yobs throwing chairs in the canal, I looked out and there was a guy flailing in the water. His head was dipping below and he was struggling for buoyancy. I shouted at him to grab the canal ladder and shone a torch so he could see what to get a hold of. He managed to grab on and climbed out of the water. I asked him if he was ok and he gave me an exhausted thumbs up. I wasn’t convinced but at least he was on the dockside. He staggered along and caught his breath. I watched him for a few minutes to make sure he didn’t stray towards the water again. I decided to grab a towel and dashed out in my gym kit and a hoody. 

He had wandered off towards the nearby shopping centre. I saw him in the distance and caught up. He was shivering badly and could barely speak so I threw the towel over his shoulders and reassured him. He was very disoriented and reeked of liquor. I told him to wrap the towel tightly around himself. He wasn’t much older than me. After some broken sentences from him, I told him that he fell into the canal and he said “what the fuck have I done?”. He began to realise what had happened. 

He said he was heading down the street and gestured the direction. Initially I was unsure entirely why. So I ushered him towards the shopping centre knowing there was a Travelodge if he didn’t have one booked  - I would’ve paid for one night if he needed. I asked if he lived around here, he doesn’t, he comes from Manchester and is in Gloucester for work only. I enquired what he did and he said that I didn’t want to know. He was wearing black outdoorsy clothes, a Bluetooth earpiece, had tattoos and looked like a bouncer of some kind. 

As we walked and talked, he wanted to know my name. He kept thanking me for my help. He apologised several times too so I reassured him everything is ok. We got to the end of the street and he assured me he knew where he was. Thankfully, he was staying at the Premier Inn. I told him to take a warm shower and to drink plenty of water when he gets back. He enthusiastically shook my hand, pulled me in for a quick hug and we parted ways. 

I got home drenched and immediately called Premier Inn. I explained the situation and they said he has just checked in and the staff will keep an eye on him for the remainder of his stay. 

As the shock began to wear off, I realised how close he was to drowning, as some drunk people have done in recent years. I wept for the danger he was in. That man was struggling and escaping from something. I really felt for him as I hit rock bottom recently. Although I didn’t turn to booze to escape, I realised that was his way of dealing with his issues and didn’t make him feel bad for what he had done. 

I just needed to tell someone because the experience shook me.

Edit: For those who doubt the authenticity of my post, you do you. You weren’t there - I was. 

I could’ve called an ambulance, yes, but I didn’t. I was in shock and I’ve never helped a stranger like this before. When people are in shock (fight or flight), generally they’re not thinking so rationally. 

Thank you to those who do understand the dangers of canals, open bodies of cold water and the dangers they pose to drunk and sober people 🙏🏻",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/q1tat3/i_saved_a_mans_life_last_night/,1633428415.0,2045,0.97,190,CasualUK,sparkzz32

p8b7ss,"""Why are you rooting for England?""","I'm an american and was in a bar in new york watching the euros finals. Someone at the bar asked me why I was cheering for England in the match and it made me think about the series of events that led to it, mostly thanks to this subreddit.

* I was on Imgur and found this video of Iggy Pop playing music for his bird that danced when it heard it: [https://imgur.com/gallery/XH52tzi](https://imgur.com/gallery/XH52tzi)
* I started listening to the band in the video, the Sleaford Mods, a punk group from Nottingham. I loved it and got really into their song, ""Tied Up In Nottz."": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFFWF1DnZKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFFWF1DnZKM)
* Part of the lyrics of ""Tied Up In Nottz"" is the phrase ""we are looking 20p in the 10p mix"". I couldn't figure out what it meant, so I googled it. I found this post on CasualUK: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/mi3fki/10p\_mix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/mi3fki/10p_mix/) I had never heard of the subreddit before, but I instantly liked it. It's my kind of vibe: no one is yelling, everyone is just talking about food and weather and cute animals they see.
* Fast forward a few weeks. I check the subreddit every day. I have never been to the UK. I now know that Waitrose is very expensive, hedgehogs and foxes are everywhere, Greggs steak bake is usually disappointing, and you can't see a god damn thing from the tallest mountain in england.
* When england was in the euros, the enthusiasm from the subreddit was infectious. I got really excited about the team's victories. I had never watched an entire football game before, but I made a point to go to bars and watch the whole game. When they got in the finals, I was thrilled.
* Day of the finals, watching the penalty kicks. Everyone in the bar seems really excited about Italy. The only other person cheering for the UK besides me and my wife is an old french guy who is cursing every time Italy scores. When he sees me cheering, he asks, ""why are *you* rooting for England?"" The only answer I could give was, ""Oh uh…I have friends there.""

Thanks for being the gateway to me learning all about the UK and football. I have had a blast since I found this place.

It’s normally [a very rare condition](https://www.rvc.ac.uk/news-and-events/rvc-news/rvc-study-to-investigate-mysterious-recent-spike-in-severe-feline-pancytopenia-cases) however [there has been a spike](https://www.facebook.com/168917303128553/posts/4211787118841531/) in the last few weeks, and members of the public are saying [most of the affected cats are dying](https://www.facebook.com/groups/806871953557080/?ref=share). In all cases, the food manufacturer seems to be the common link.

Edit 1:
Added more detail.

Edit 2: Fold Hill Foods have [released an FAQ](https://www.foldhill.co.uk/recall/) about the situation. The RVC have also [released an update](https://www.rvc.ac.uk/news-and-events/rvc-news/feline-pancytopenia-update) on the investigation, however the cause has not yet been confirmed. Hopefully we’ll soon know more

Also, [Wilko have recalled some of their cat food](https://www.wilko.com/medias/A4-CAT-FOOD-PRODUCT-RECALL-FINAL-18.6.21.pdf?context=bWFzdGVyfGltYWdlc3w2MjA4ODZ8YXBwbGljYXRpb24vcGRmfGltYWdlcy9oZTgvaDk2LzkxNzk4MzgwNTQ0MzAucGRmfGEyNmIyZTQ0NGY5NTk5ZWY1OTU0YmY4N2YyYzYxMWUwNjM4OGMyYTYxZjg5NDNmODczYjQ2MjQ3NWY0ZTU4ZTI) voluntarily.

hv9lh6,Different take on redundancy.,"Two sides to every coin, as always.

Background: Late 20's, engineer, privately owned manufacturer of a semi-luxury product.

Got told last week that come mid august I won't have a job. Cheeky fuckers even asked for an extra couple of weeks past my notice. Initially furloughed in april, brought back for start of july by demand from another dept within the company. Redundancies announced as soon as I came back - thought I'd be safe because of the department that wanted me back. Nope. Bunch of other people going too.

Do I give a fuck about being made redundant? No. I give a fuck that the the billionaire owned firm which is fully aware of it's cyclical financial performance and never made any accommodation for something like this, and is now turfing out a number of people to go find a new job in the pandemic and start of a recession. I give a fuck that I have bills to pay, debt to pay off and don't own my house - so I can't even do the ""start living"" thing, I have to go and panic to not have a lapse in pay. I give a fuck that I might have to shoot my own career/aspirations in the leg to survive, and I give a fuck about my colleagues which will struggle to find something new because of their situation. I give a fuck that a number of old-timers at the company got the opportunity of voluntary and walked away with 30k+ while I don't even qualify for the minimum payment because I've worked here for under 2 years. 

It's all a giant pile of shit. And I really am not looking forward to the panicked job search.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/hv9lh6/different_take_on_redundancy/,1595346101.0,112,0.95,38,CasualUK,ultilink

Terry quickly became the sub favourite with a delightfully inept performance before pulling it out of the bag with some sort of Van Gogh inspired/Norman Bates ""selfie portrait"" made out of biscuit, keeping him in by a whisker. That meant we sadly had to say goodbye to Imelda. Bye Imedla! Ruby clung on by her fingertips, too. A repeat performance from either Big Tel or Ruby could see them on shaky ground.

In more positive news, Manon delivered some French quality early on, with some stylish and apparently tasty bakes making her the first Star Baker. Briony, Dan and Antony had some strong rounds and look like early pace setters alongside Manon.

Special mention to Karen - I wonder what crisps she'll whip out this week?

9cu9fh,**BISCUIT FUN FACT KLAXON** Bourbon Biscuits were the first biscuit on the moon,"&gt;Bourbon Creams were the first biscuit to be eaten on the moon. Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin took a packet of Bourbon Creams with him for the journey, and ate the last one whilst stood on the surface of the moon whilst a dejected Neil Armstrong was still trying to extracate his Rich Tea biscuits from his spacesuit pocket.

​

I was also going to post some fun facts about how the Bourbon came into existence... However a quick google has brought up two separate origin stories. So pick and believe whichever one you prefer:

​

# Option 1 ([biscuitpeople.com](https://biscuitpeople.com))

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Bourbon may be a popular biscuit delicacy but the treat was actually invented by a German – Dr. Hans Zehnloch in the 1930, while working for Cadbury’s R&amp;D department. The professor came up with a trademark on the biscuit whereby each would bear 10 holes; drawing from the fact that Zehnloch literally translates into ’10 holes’. On to where the term Bourbon actually came from, it is a contraction of their place of invention – BOURnville and professor Zehnloch’s hometown – BONn. As a result, the biscuits were originally known as Bourbonn creams, but the second ‘n’ was dropped in 1963 and so the biscuit came to be known simply as Bourbon.

​

# Option 2 (Wikipedia)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The biscuit was introduced in 1910 (originally under the name ""Creola"") by the biscuit company Peek Freans, of Bermondsey, London, originator of the Garibaldi biscuit. The new name was taken from the European royal House of Bourbon.

I know some of you may say you'd rather 1 December but like a milking stool, our argument rests on three legs.
 
- Monday 26 November means we can start talk about the build up to Christmas. For example, what advent calendar everyone is getting. Too late on 1 December, the advent calendars have already been bought. 
 
- The shops will have already had their stock up for ages, so you can all stop posting ""Tesco have their Christmas stock up"" posts.

- Only morons and men leave Christmas shopping *until* Christmas. End of November we can talk about prospective gifts, holidays and other stuff.. What advent calendar everyone is getting, what pressies are you buying, are you going away for the holidays, or just general chat about how you can't want to get your lips round a dry old bird and some spuds.

9c7cdj,The Ups and Downs of Just Eat,"Ordered a meal from my favourite Chinese place at 19:00. Just Eat said they'd confirmed the delivery time as 19:55. I notice afterwards that the place is under new management. 

After it got to 20:30 without food arriving, I phoned the place, asked politely but firmly where my order was. After some confusion I was given the oddly specific ETA of 12 minutes. 

After it got to 21:10 without food arriving, I phoned the place again. And again. And again. After a fourth time I got through. It'll be ten minutes. 

After it got to 21:50 without food arriving, I asked Just Eat for a refund. Their chat agent took about 20 minutes to do this. I got a £5 voucher for my inconvenience. I put an emergency ready meal in the oven. 

It's 23:00 by the time I take it out of the oven. At this point my takeaway arrives. I explain that I cancelled the order over an hour ago, but the delivery guy clearly couldn't care less, and leaves it with me anyway. There are two meals, only one of which I ordered. 

I scrape my ready meal off the plate and put it into tupperware for tomorrow's lunch. I eat the takeaway. My partner, arriving back from her night out, eats the other one. 

Ho hum. I can't leave a review (which would at this point destroy their rating because they only have two other reviews) because the order was cancelled, but I would strongly suggest not ordering from Golden House in Lancaster.

9c731t,Just watched a group of lads try to get attention from a group of women in Wetherspoons,"First gambit: lean over and ask what Princess Leia's hairstyle is called. Not a bad opener, bit of cheeky trivia, both parties now know the other exists and the door to future conversation has been opened.

Second gambit: carefully listen to women's conversation with your back to them.  Overhear that they're from Cheshire. Shout - ostensibly to your friend - that ""CHESHIRE'S A SHITHOLE!"". When this doesn't get a response, add ""OI MATE THESE SLAGS ARE FROM CHESHIRE!"".  Poor choice. Formerly interested women are now much less interested. Did get an 'excuse me pal' but lost points overall.

Third gambit was to start loudly singing, and they then devolved into randomly shouting ""SLAG!"" for attention. :/. Whole thing devolved over about twenty minutes, and it wasn't even 9pm.  These guys were easily in their mid-twenties. Is it really that hard to just start a casual conversation? Why would random insults ever be thought of as a better option?  Am girl, don't understand.

9bmlgn,I’ve had a terrifying experience.,"So I got on the train that I thought was mine. It wasn’t on the board yet but it was on the right platform, right company etc and it’s quite normal for my train to be on the platform half an hour or so before it’s due to set off. 

Exactly 40 minutes before departure it set off. With only me on board. It first went in the right direction, then stopped. I panicked. But then it started to go back towards the station so I calmed down. Until the station became a speck in my past. 

I ended up in the depot. Alone. Stuck on a train. I banged on the window and a passing man took pity on me and rescued me from my Greater Anglia prison. I then had to walk back to the station, missed the train I was waiting for and am now a sweaty, anxious, panicked mess. 


TL;DR - I got on a train that ended up at the depot with only me on it. Very scared. Safe now. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9bmlgn/ive_had_a_terrifying_experience/,1535656396.0,498,0.99,87,CasualUK,22Nathski

9b1gcw,Great British Bake Off Week One (28/08/18) - Biscuit Week!,"Bake off is back! Welcome to the 2018 version - 8pm Tuesday, C4. Let's go!

This week (if rumours are to be believed) is Biscuit Week! Strong start. I've not much else to add since we've no idea who anyone is really. Let's meet them all:

**Our hosts**

[Noel Fielding](https://i.imgur.com/HvX8ajb.jpg) and [Sandi Toksvig](http://sanditoksvig.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Portsmouth.jpg) are in charge of proceedings, with [Paul Hollywood](https://i.imgur.com/hfRQLFf.jpg) and [Prue Leith](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lb-comp-prue-v3.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=750&amp;h=500&amp;crop=1) delivering withering put downs and assessments of a bunch of amateurs attempts at professional level baking. The bastards.

**[This year's contestants](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45248320)**

**Jon, 47**

Jon is a blood courier from Newport. He wants to be ""experimental"" in his bakes. I imagine that means lots of weird flavours and delicate designs that don't quite work.

*Prediction* Week: 6

**Kim-Joy, 27**

A mental health worker from Leeds via Belgium and Malaysia. Looks kooky. Guaranteed to annoy me.

*Prediction* Week: 1

**Rahul, 30**

Research scientist from India originally. I hope he makes a chicken balti pie at some point. That's proper east meets west, Rahul, not whatever you're thinking of cooking up.

*Prediction* Week: 4

**Antony, 30**

Banker. Fuck off Antony, mate. Also grew up in India and styles himself a Bollywood baker. Reckon they've accidentally got the same bloke twice with these last two?

*Prediction* Week: 2

**Karen, 60**

The older baker to appease the WE. Karen looks like she has a trick or three up her sleeves though. Behind those glasses are the cold, dead eyes of a winner. She's done this before, she'll do it again. Hide your baked alaska, Rahul. She's coming for you.

*Prediction* Week: 8

**Ruby, 29**

Ruby likes making sweet treats for her family. Also grew up in India, exotic. Bet she's crap but stays in 'cos Paul Hollywood gives her the eye. The great big perv.

*Prediction* Week:7

**Luke, 30**

Luke's a civil servant from Sheffield. Being from Sheff alone makes him my favourite, but he's also techno DJ! What a man! I bet he loves a [Buttery Biscuit base.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMg3epr53Ns)

*Prediction* Week: FINAL

**Manon, 26**

This years youngest contestant, Manon hails from France and is a software project manager, whatever that means. Expect fondant fancies and a constant sneering attitude. If she doesn't win it's definitive proof that the UK is superior to France.

*Prediction* Week: 9

**Briony, 33**

Full time mum Briony is a Bristolian who leant everything about baking from YouTube. As fellow denizens of the internet, we should definitely support her.

*Prediction* Week: FINAL

**Imelda, 33**

Countryside recreation officer (???) Imelda is from Norn Iron. She was taught by her ma, as I suspect everyone was at some point. Imelda listened though. See where you could be if you listened to you mum? Listen to your mothers, you ungrateful sods. Give her a call after Bake Off and chat about it with her. She'll be thrilled. Make sure you tell her you love her as well, bet you don't tell her enough, but she doesn't mind. She's a saint is your mum.

*Prediction* Week: 3

**Terry, 56**

Big Tel is retired and is planning on bringing ingredients from his very own microbrewery. What a man! Go on Tel!

*Prediction* Week: FINAL

**Dan, 36**

Dan's a stay at home dad who's looking forward to ""time to himself away from the kids"" during Bake Off. It's alright Dan, just say you hate the kids mate. It's fine.

*Prediction* Week: 5

**So there we go! As the weeks go I'll delete off out hapless bakers and add a bit more prelude at the top. LET'S BAKE!**

&amp;#x200B;

It's a model of a Romano British ""strip"" house (they lined the roads leading up to towns and forts, with the short end facing the street) This one's based on the kinds of combined house /shops you got outside forts like Vindolanda and Housesteads up North. But archaeologists find houses like these all over Roman Britain. Often they were home to tradespeople such as cobblers, tailors, and potters  whose businesses served local military and urban areas.

&amp;#x200B;

[Housesteads Fort, with its \\""Vicus\\"" or village outside the walls.](https://preview.redd.it/yyji7h1flsi11.jpg?width=588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90b57fa9e5fc343746ead7839d2ee24603c982b3)

You can download it (it's a pdf) from [here](https://www.chapbookhistory.co.uk/product-page/roman-house) and just use the code **Holidays2018** in the relevant box to get it for Free!

All you need is a printer, some scissors and and a glue stick / PVA, and it might bag you a few hours to get stuff done!

*Mods: I hope this is OK?  It's free and kinda educational, but if it goes against the grain, I'll understand &amp; I'll take my punishment like man (lip stiffens)*

We actually lived in Watford (don't worry, I won't be posting any photos from there) so we took every opportunity to go exploring all around the UK. From Cornwall to Scotland and many places in between (although still not enough!) we were so lucky to get to spend a few years living in and discovering all that the UK has to offer. We hope to get back one day, but for now I am enjoying revisiting our experiences by posting some of my favourite photos I took during our travels.

98r35x,Lidl vs Aldi - which items are better in which shop?,"Where I live, there’s an Aldi 15 minutes walk in one direction, and a Lidl 15 minutes in exactly the opposite direction. I used to go to both pretty much evenly, but then I started baking bread and Lidl sells good bread flour, whereas Aldi does not. So Lidl is now my supermarket of choice.

I did go to Aldi yesterday on a one-off, however, and it got me thinking about which store does what better. Hoping some of you can contribute.

Aldi does much better cheddar cheese. Lidl’s falls apart and is almost crumbly, in a bad way. I bought 3 blocks of it in Aldi yesterday.

Lidl’s wine selection is better presented - it has more product information. Beer is about the same between both.

Aldi’s ‘premium’ ground coffee is better than Lidl’s.

Lidl has the superior nut selection, and even has a help yourself bit with scoops etc. Pro tip - by weight, the unsalted cashew nuts are significantly cheaper in the pre-packed bag than  the salted ones in the help yourself bit. If you wanted salted, it’s still well worth it to buy the unsalted ones and sprinkle a bit of salt on them. 

Aldi does a shower gel made by ‘Lacura’ (probably their own brand?) It’s like a knock off of the ‘Sanex’ brand - comes in a white bottle with a blue cap. Lasts about a month, is actually all round a really good shower gel, and is about 99p. Nothing close at Lidl.

I have too much time on my hands. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/98r35x/lidl_vs_aldi_which_items_are_better_in_which_shop/,1534744613.0,71,0.92,134,CasualUK,Shryke123

982fpv,I'm addicted to Weetabix,"I know this sounds absurd, petty and silly, but I really do have a genuine problem. For years now I've eaten two Weetabix and an apple for breakfast. A nutritious and satisfying start to the day. This arrangement was fine, until about a month and a half ago. That was when the cravings started. 

At random points in the day, I would just get suddenly, desperately hungry - hungry for Weetabix. Maybe when I got home from school, or on a Saturday morning, I'd feel the urge and eat a couple. It was about this time that I moved on from just taking them with milk. I started buttering my Weetabix - I even ate a few dry. 

But things got worse. I found myself reaching for the yellow box more and more frequently. I couldn't stop myself. Worse still, I found that when the hunger came, it could often no longer be sated by just two Weetabix. I just kept going back for more - and now that I was taking up to four at a time, my daily consumption regularly hit double figures. 

I don't know what to do. For three days in a row, my two breakfast Weetabix haven't been enough. I had four this morning, and four more a few hours later, and I just know that it won't be long before I eat again. I've tried replacing them with toast, oatcakes, even cornflakes, but nothing's the same. And every time it takes more to achieve the same satisfaction. The family packs are cheap in Lidl, but all the same I'm spending risible sums on my cereal habit and something's got to change.

Also the old jokes went in 3 phases to my knowledge:

Phase 1: probably some time around 9/11, they were jokes unrelated to penguins and were *alright*

Phase 2: until probably a few years ago they were penguin related jokes and they were shite: things like ""where does the penguin keep his money? In a snow bank"". Meh.

Phase 3: current jokes. Mine just said (not verbatim): ""how did the penguin pass his driving test? HE WINGED IT!"" 10/10 and penguin related, too.

Hats off from me to Penguin bars for showing the other, frankly now inferior bars how it's done.

96exgb,Slim Saturdays: The First One,"Hey everyone! As some of you may have seen, I posted a thread on here a few days ago to gauge interest in some sort of ongoing weight loss thread for those of us who wanna shift a bit of the old flab. Well, here it is!

We're gonna be keeping track of our weight every week - you don't have to post your weight if you don't want to, but it would be handy to at least post how much you lose (or gain - it's a marathon not a sprint!) each week. 

Also, I'll be posting recipe of the week (one carnivore, one vegan) and you guys feel free to comment with whatever you want! Whether it be a recipe, a pic of a particularly delish and healthy meal you've had this week, tips and tricks for weight loss... anything! 

I think it's important to keep a couple of fairly loose but important rules going - I'd first off say it's important for this place to be a totally judgement-free zone. We're all in this together and no one gains anything from judgement or general nastiness. As well as this, I'd say it's important that you be honest with yourself and the rest of us - if you're struggling to lose or hit a plateau or whatever we're all here to encourage you and share our own experiences and tips and tricks to help you keep going, so don't be shy! 

Without further ado, here is my weigh-in and recipes of the week!

Week 1: 251lbs 

Recipes of the week:

**Vegan** 
[Linguine with avocado, tomato and lime](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/linguine-avocado-tomato-lime)

**Carnivore** [Pork, green bean &amp; oyster stir fry]
(https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1813671/pork-green-bean-and-oyster-stirfry)

Okay everyone, go nuts! Post some of your favourite recipes, maybe your targets and goal weights, stuff you'd like to cut down on, anything and everything weight-loss related. I'd really love it if we could get a lovely, supportive community going on and help each other slim down!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/96exgb/slim_saturdays_the_first_one/,1533973457.0,62,0.91,93,CasualUK,[deleted]

Long shot of long shots that you will see this, but I heard you eff and blind at me, and rightly so, I was in the wrong in your eyes. So, sorry for nearly flattening you on your way to the station.

965arh,My very British claim to fame,"When I was 16, I worked at the Westbound Little  Chef on the A303 at Andover. One time Anthony Head (of Gold Blend and Buffy fame) stopped in for some lunch.

An extraordinary claim to fame by itself I'm sure you'll agree, but there's more. On the menu was a cheese and mushroom omelette. Giles asked if he could have a cheese omelette. We had to explain that he couldn't because the mushrooms had been added some months previously when the omelette was frozen in the Chinese factory.

At around the same time, the CEO ended up on Watchdog, explaining to Anne Robinson that the words ""All food freshly prepared to order"" on the menu weren't bullshit. His argument was that microwaving an omelette then giving it a few seconds on each side on the griddle counts as 'preparation'. That didn't go down well so he went on to say that we would be happy to cook a fresh omelette for anyone who wanted one. But none of the restaurants had any frying pans so that wasn't actually possible.

Happy times",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/965arh/my_very_british_claim_to_fame/,1533891697.0,394,0.97,182,CasualUK,[deleted]

h7g414,12/06/20 - State of the Subreddit and getting your thoughts,"Hello!

We've been having a bit of a chinwag in the mod lair and wanted to get the thoughts of you, the unwashed masses. We usually do an annual survey where people can suggest thoughts and opinions, but as this year has been unusual I think it makes sense to open things up a little sooner. We're halfway through the year and three months into a lockdown, so let's chat.

Some quick thoughts to start you off;

- We have had an ever so slight relaxation of our 'no politics' rule which was [detailed here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/fhk93i/coronaviruscovid19_on_casualuk/) when the severity of coronavirus became apparent. In essence, alluding to the ongoing restrictions by saying ""the UK govt is doing xyz"" was fine, but saying ""the UK govt is doing xyz and I think it is bad"" or, ""the Tories/Labour are doing xyz"" for example was still against the no politics rule. This slight relaxation will remain in place, but remember the rule is no politics or political references regardless of context or intent. You will receive a 1 day ban for a comment and 3 days for a post.

- As a result of coronavirus, we have introduced the temporary Rule 10 ""coronaposting"". It's a bit of a catch all overlap with low effort, and was used constantly throughout March and April, especially. We had literally thousands of posts removed. We get a lot of low effort posts, repetitive landscape posts, reposts about big topics or ""one upping"" posts. Our moderation process is to use our subjective judgement to remove posts, often discussing things as a mod team before making a decision. For example, if there are 10 gorgeous landscapes posted at once, we'll likely remove 9 of them and remove any more posted that day. It's nothing personal, we know people like the British landscape, but we're not a subreddit exclusively for that.

- Added to this, we do not automate any moderation. We think it is necessary and essential to manually remove posts. Sometimes we are either too busy with the sub to leave a comment or just forget (we're people with lives, y'know?). If we've removed yours and you're not sure why pop us a message in modmail. We may be sarcastic or blunt back to you, but then again it's just the internet so if your picture of loo roll was removed then it's not the end of the world, is it? Often, we remove a post like this because it would not generate discussion, so posting your unremarkable picture as a question designed to generate discussion would be much better.

- Which leads me to discussion threads. Some of our favourite posts as mods have been discussion threads. They get people really interacting and create a community feel. Are there any threads you would like to see or start yourself? [This thread about slang](https://old.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/h06tcq/is_there_any_british_slang_or_colloquialisms_that/) was great, for example. A thread about your favourite biscuit is not any more. Any regular ideas that you have? We are always excited to see great OC and will support those who want to post it on Casuk - see the regular quizzes and recipes.

- Food posts. A lot of posts are about what you've eaten. These will be removed and redirected to /r/UK_food unless they are either very good or hilariously bad. Either way we will need a recipe to be posted in the comments to keep the food post up. Please encourage the shit food posts to post their recipe most of all.

Anything else that's on your mind? Are there any sort of posts that you believe are starting to get overplayed and we can keep an eye out for? We like to think we do an alright job, but any thoughts would be appreciated. If you're not comfortable posting publicly then pop us a modmail.

93ygad,Here's the new game...,"I noticed that on this sub, whenever anybody posts an image of the UK, within minutes somebody else has identified exactly where it is.

So here's the game.

Post a link to an image of somewhere in the UK and people have to figure out where it is.

I'll start, albeit not with my own image.


**Guidelines**

- Blur out your answers (see sidebar) by answering in square brackets followed by (/s)

- Ideally where you live or have been and an image you've taken yourself. 

- Be reasonable, a random bush or house is useless, it needs to be possible.

- Obviously avoid links that say place names.

- No googling or reverse image searching. Brain power and memory only.

- When somebody has gotten it right, give them lots of up votes! Whilst you're at it, upvote the thread :)

- Post new links on this thread. Provide answers using ""reply"", under that link.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/93ygad/heres_the_new_game/,1533209286.0,182,0.98,353,CasualUK,ac13332

I have never been to the UK but find reading this sub to be entertaining, informative, a little foreign but also cozy and warm at the same time.  Last night my server at a restaurant had an English accent. I began talking to him and admitted I was a bit of an Anglophile. He was the best representative for the UK ever. He was such a joy to talk to and didn’t make me feel stupid for any of my questions. We talked off and on for two hours. I learned a lot because most of what I know about the UK I have read. I learned that your beans are not our baked beans, which is what I assumed as they look the same. I asked him how to tut. He looked at me funny then kinda sucked air through his teeth. I had no idea that was the physical action for tutting! I knew a lot from this sub. We talked about the dry weather you’re having, differences in chocolates, and pronunciations of cities there and here (Edinburgh and Pittsburgh). We laughed about the difference in the word fanny.

He emails me every now and then asking how I am and how the fishing is, what my fishing plans are for the weekend. He's currently banned from fishing by his Mrs because it's too hot and he needs to look after his heart.

Today he accidentally sent me a photo of himself whilst complaining about not being able to update something. We managed to fix it and now he's telling me about his sons upcoming wedding.

&gt;Cadbury milk chocolate in a twisted hollow spiral.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spira’s distinctive form came from new chocolate extrusion technology. And rumour has it that some Spira customers used to bite the ends of the hollow chocolate ‘straw’ and then use it to drink hot beverages, melting the inside. So wrong it’s right!

That's right fuckers, you can use it as a straw. Unlike Twirl which is a soggy piece of shit that melts in winter, Spira was hard as a boiled egg, and you could suck hot lead through it. And then eat the straw. It is made of delicious chocolate.

&gt;Following a million-pound investment in plant at the Bournville factory, Cadbury first test-launched Spira in the Granada television region. The chocolate was successful enough to gain a 6.3% market share and the number two chocolate position, but it proved impossible to produce sufficient quantities to keep up with demand at this stage. The bar was withdrawn from market and a new test market was established in the south-west while additional factory capacity was built.\[2\]

Spira was so popular that they needed to build a whole fucking new factory to handle it. So why did it disappear then Cadburys? Something to do with that smarmy cunt Twirl I expect. Twirl is similar to Spira except eating it is like biting into a steamy diaper of chocolate shit. It melts way too fast and tastes like plastic. Bring back Spira and consign Twirl to room 101.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/91h4cv/cadburys_get_your_act_together_and_make_spira/,1532436794.0,94,0.89,50,CasualUK,therico

This morning, I got up 7 minutes before my alarm went off at 7am, had a leisurely time in the bathroom, got dressed, sat down with a cuppa and breakfast, made my lunch, brushed my teeth and rolled out the door just before 8.30am to arrive at work at 8:57, including a gentle stroll along the seafront from the car park at the end of the universe.

God I've missed the UK.

8zu1rl,Never a dull moment in mcdonalds,"So I took my 3 kids and one of their friends to McDonald's for tea yesterday. 

My youngest (age 4) is a wheelchair user. All the low tables were being used except a 2 seater one in the corner next to the window (which had 2 other tables beside it) table 3 will be the table I was heading to, table 2 will be the middle 4 seater and table one will be the 2 seater table at the other side.

Table 1 was full, table 2 had a Snot Nosed Granny sat at it with her 2 wonderful grandkids. I told the 3 bigger kids to go sit at one of the high tables and we would sit in the corner. 

So as I was walking past table 1, one of the grandkids had moved a chair that obstructed table 3. I began moving the chair to be able to get my daughter to the table and SNG piped up *pointing to table number 2* ""you can't sit there, I'm reserving those seats!!"" 

I politely replied ""i was actually heading to that table"" then pointed to table number 3 ""I wasn't planning on sitting at the table with you"" 

She paused for a minute, trying to think of what to say after looking like a wanker refusing a space to a kid in a wheelchair. She then said ""eh... well.. I actually meant the CHAIR! You can't use that chair. My daughter needs it! You need to put it back!""

Again, I politely replied ""my daughter is already in a wheelchair and doesn't need the chair, i was moving it out of the way to get her to the table"" and she literally hung her head in shame and shut up.


So rather than teach her grandkids to maybe *help* those in need, she taught them to belittle them and be rude to them. 

In the end, the chair that she so desperately *needed* was never used by her daughter. 


Bonus: at the end of our meal, I stood up to move one of the high chairs that was put in the way, and a teenage boy saw me trying to move it, came over and moved it for me then put it back. I (maybe a *little* bit loudly) said ""thank you so much for helping I really do appreciate that. It's nice to know there are kind people still out there""

8zt1ka,"So, I just lost my job yesterday.","Yesterday started out like any other day. Got up, got ready, kissed my wife and 18 month old son goodbye and headed out the door. Got to work nice an early as always and set about my work day. Had a few meetings about projects I was working on and designs for them with the MD of the company. All was going fine. 

Then, the MD asked to have a chat and next thing I know I'm led into the FDs office and told that I no longer have a job. 

I'd been there 15 months and they were disappointed with my progress and they didn't feel I was right for the role. No prior warning about this, no inclination they were disappointed in how I was working, no chance to improve. Just see you later, hope you can feed your son in a few weeks without an income. 

I have anxiety and depression and this has just about pushed me over the edge. I have a bit of a choppy CV from the last few years after I lost my job back in 2015 due to the collapse of the company I was working with before and a couple of jobs I took were just too far of a commute to make it a viable position, especially with a little one at home. 

So now I'm just lost. I'm convinced I won't get a job again with my CV and I'm really concerned about what is actually going to happen in the long run. 

[Update] Just thought I would give folks an update if they were interested. I have an interview for a Design Engineers job lined up next Wednesday and I have the appeal meeting at my old place tomorrow. This is mainly to have a proper sit down with them and find out a few things that I will be bringing to ACAS in terms of a claim. I have looked through everything and they seem to be in breach of both my employment contract and their own policies with the way they have dealt with this. So I have a case for wrongful dismissal.

8z3dia,A review of a shitty meal,"Whilst recently doing some shopping, I came across a meal that even by my standards, appeared shitty. 

I didn’t even know [Kebab meat and cheesy chips](https://i.imgur.com/uyrfX7I.jpg) was something you could buy in ready meal form.  

I was Intrigued and for only £1, felt I needed to try it. 

There are three different types of meat in the ingredients, 5% being lamb. I don’t usually buy lamb so it’s a nice treat to have some. 

Cooking instructions were simple, cook for 15 minutes in the oven, add the cheese and bake for a further 10 minutes. 

The cheese was still mainly frozen which meant I had to warm it up in my hands to be able to sprinkle it, which was a mild inconvenience. 

After cooking, I was surprised on how little grease was left from cooking, even after eating, little grease was left. 

[The finished meal](https://i.imgur.com/VXsuh8j.jpg)looked rather depressing. 

The cheese was all clumped up, could have probably benefited from adding some more of my own. 

The chips were mainly all hard, typical cheap oven chips texture with a slight potato taste. 

The ‘meat’ was nearly all dry and developed a cardboard like texture. After getting over the texture, the taste was actually pretty ok. 

To sum it up, I’d say it would probably be best eaten after a night of heavy drinking, but the alternative of going to a take away for kebab outweighs the effort of cooking it. 

Overall, I’d give it a **4/10**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8z3dia/a_review_of_a_shitty_meal/,1531675981.0,165,0.98,42,CasualUK,9DAN2
8z3cgd,A Casual UK Formal Announcement. Now Pay Attention !,"At CasualUK we pride ourselves on our 'Give Money to Charity' threads that we run each quarter. In modern life it's often fashionable to poo-poo the idea of altruism and donating to a worthy cause. Indeed, many cynics reject the idea of regularly donating a not inconsiderable amount of money every single month.

However, it *does* produce results. And as proof the Mod Team would like to announce that the hard work and hard cash of two regular contributors has paid off and we have invited them to join the ~~Gravy Train~~, erm I mean, Moderator Team.

So please welcome you new Overlords and step forward : /u/little-feet and /u/meteoritee who have accepted our invitation. They've both helped out a lot recently and their brown nosing has worked.

If anyone from customer service or whatever it is, is reading this. If your turnover is dropping, this is why. Shops are for convenience, it isn't convenient to wait half an hour because you have one poor nice person on the CS desk.

8ysf45,So I was just assaulted,"I was waiting for a bus in a my town at the bus station. Browsing Reddit, looking around, typical stuff. I heard muttering from someone stood too close behind me to my right. Stuff like: ""spending time looking at that thing..."" ""Don't look around at people..."" And so on. 
  
After about 5 minutes of this I was getting a bit distracted and frustrated by this guy talking in my ear. I turned around to see who was doing my nut in and there was a guy there, easily 30 years older than me, a foot shorter and 4 stone lighter. Standard old man #6. 
  
He vocalized something like a shriek and swung at me with his right arm and smacked me on the side. He then stumbled/flounced away into the bus station information room/waiting area. (No damage was done).
  
Worrying for this guy's welfare I called 101 and eventually gave them his description and described what happened. I would hate for him to hurt himself or someone else and not log it with someone. I would assume he was high or mentally ill or something considering he assaulted a stranger who was twice his size in public.

8y51ue,Brain damage is coming home?,"A couple of weeks ago I noticed that there appears to be a massive ants’ nest under the front of my house. Whilst I’m not normally one for murdering living creatures, I also don’t want the front of my house to subside into an enormous sinkhole, so I bought some ant powder insecticide from B&amp;Q - it’s basically nerve agent for ants.

Earlier today I finally got round to sprinkling this white powder around the entrances the nest, mainly along the sides of the path and step between my front door and the gate onto the street.

So about 20 minutes ago, 1AM, I heard a massive commotion out the front - turning out time at the pub just down the road and obviously a couple of unhappy England supporters worse for wear. We've had a few problems with tagging and puking on the doorstep etc, so when I heard the clink of the gate being opened I thought I better get dressed and go out to see what was going on.

I go out to find two lads, one of whom is inside my gate on all fours snorting a massive line of white powder off my front path. Whilst in his state he probably thinks I’ve sprinkled a kilo of charlie around my house, he’s actually on my property snorting insecticide off the floor. The guys rapidly cleared off when I came outside, but now I’m a bit concerned that although this stuff is supposed to be pet friendly, it’s not intended to be inhaled by humans. If this guy gets brain damage or dies am I going to get sued? This is not a dilemma I ever thought I’d have to deal with at 1AM on a Thursday night. Anyone had to deal with this before?

The World Cup quarter final between England and Sweden, you muppet! Win this and it's two more games to win the whole thing! The winner of this game is set to play either Croatia or Russia in the semi final of the competition next week.

**WHERE**

[Samara, Russia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara) The 6th largest city in Russia, and definitely one you hadn't heard of before the World Cup. Tolstoy lived there for a while and it holds an annual festival called the Grushinsky Festival for bards. As you do. 

Weather -  Saturday 15:00 - Light Rain Showers - Temperature 18 degrees Celcius -Precipitation 41&amp;#37; - Humidity 66&amp;#37; - Wind speed 6 mph

**WHO**

**Sweden** \- a county in Europe, roughly 10 million people live there. They're a decent bunch, polite, tidy, and socially repressed. They're quite like us in that respect. [Here's a quick rundown of their (probable) team from Afton Bladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/9mdAnp/dear-england-youve-got-it-in-the-bag), a newspaper over there.

**MATCH UPDATES**

0 - kick off

10 - nothing has happened except we've given the ball away a lot and Sweden had a couple of pot shots.

18 - Sterling has a run. Give it to him more! Kane's shot went wide.

23 - tedium is setting in.

26 - both teams quite nervous. Alli has given the ball away more than he's passed successfully.

27 - the Swedish captain, Granqvist, who plays in the Swedish second tier goes on a little run and trips over his own feet. Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, the two highest scoring Englishmen in the premiership last season, are yet to get the better of Granqvist.

30 - [HARRY MAGUIRE](https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_700,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.thestar.co.uk/webimage/1.9233855.1530685299!/image/image.jpg) [HEADER FROM A CORNER, FUCKING LEGEND 1-0 ENGLAND!!!!](https://streamja.com/XqKz)

33 - I went to school with Maguire from 4-16. I'm so, so fucking happy for him. Absolute hero!

38 - honestly this game has been shit, but let's get another corner, get Kane on the score sheet and shut up shop.

39 - Alli with some great pressure. Good lad.

42 - Forsberg with a good cross in that Pickford saves easily. We've done well to keep Forsberg quiet so far, but Sweden haven't really threatened at all.

44 - sterling 1 on 1! Save from the keeper, runs free - offside for sterling. Quite clear, looks like sterling knew so was a little half hearted.

45 - sterling again! Runs free, keeper with a great save and sterling's indecision leads to a lack of options and it's an England corner!

HALF TIME - England ended the half excellently. The last five minutes were brilliant from England, could have been 3 goals I reckon. Sweden yet to threaten too much. England need to keep up the pace that led to the series of corners in the last 10 and the couple of opportunities from sterling. Get RLC on for Alli, Gaz!

Half time entertainment - some cracking pictures from fan parks. Croydon and Newcastle had the beers going everywhere. Top stuff!

HT - there's a bloke who's the spit of Southgate in the crowd.

46 - after Linekar has put the kiss of death on us with some stats, the second half kicks off.

47 - shit the bed Sweden with a great header and Pickford with an absolutely incredible save! What a guy!

50 - do you think Kieron Trippier's haircut will become the new thing after this world cup?

54 - head tennis in the box comes to nothing for England from a freekick, followed up by sterling breaking free and sending a decent ball in. The Swedes are falling apart like cheap, shit furniture.

57 - another corner...

58 - ...comes to nothing. 

59 - DELE ALLI ALL IS FORGIVEN! [We are dominant, a beautiful Lingard cross is met by an unmarked Alli, who nods it over the goalkeeper. Beautiful!](https://streamja.com/lXRz)

62 - Jordan Pickford is a fucking hero! A lovely passing move from the Swede leads to a clear chance which Pickford parries away, before Henderson clears and we get rid! 

63 - game is very open right now. Forsberg is looking pretty tidy.

65 - Forsberg subbed off for Olssen, Toivonen for Guidetti. England corner!

66 - bounces around, falls to Maguire! Skies it. Nice one Harry.

68 - someone put a rocket up Alli at half-time. He's been great this half. Him sterling and kane on the break gets us another corner eventually.

71 - Jordan Pickford with another good save. He's up there for man of the match.

74 - if Guy Mowbray can stop jinxing this that would be amazing.

76 - delph on for alli. Alli had a fairly poor game other than the 10 minutes around where he scored. 

78 - Kraft makes a fantastic block to deny sterling a tap in! 

81 - Southgate isn't a fan of substitutions is he?

84 - Henderson off for dier. Dier poor so far, but can't have Hendo getting a yellow.

85 - krafth for Janssen for Sweden 

87 - Maguire and Guidetti get a yellow each for having a bit of a barney

90 - Sweden sky a freekick.

90 - Sterling for Rashford.

90 - Larsson yellow.

90+ - is it coming home..?

After lurking on here for, literally years, I've finally decided to take the plunge and create an account, just to say thanks, both to the wider community and to whoever posted the above link a few months ago in particular.

I'm an airline pilot who's been sat at home for the last few months, staring down the barrel of redundancy - I'm likely to get my marching orders next week. This sub has been one of the few things that have managed to keep my stress levels somewhat under control, whenever they spike 5 minutes of looking at what you crazy kids are up to normally calms me down a bit. 

In particular, whoever posted up the link to the webcam for the peregrine falcon nest in Norwich Cathedral, that one link has been an absolute lifeline, following those little murder chickens grow up and fly away was absolutely bloody fascinating and a real privilege to watch. 

Now I've got to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. If anyone has any job tips for someone who's 15 year career staring out of the window looking at clouds in a variety of interesting locations is pretty much over, hit me up, I'm all ears.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/h0vtei/whoever_posted_the_norwich_peregrine_webcam/,1591867042.0,56,1.0,35,CasualUK,moonchaser881

I know not everyone is a fan of zoos, and in an ideal world, I absolutely agree that there shouldn't be a need for them. But for now, there is, and ours are some world leaders in conservation. 

I know everything about the lockdown and Covid and all of it has been properly shit. I'm so ridiculously excited about this little victory. For me at least, it's a tiny step back towards normality again and it's gonna do so much for my mental health! Plus, I trust my local zoos to have a much safer social distancing plan than say... Primark, which feels like a scrum in a jumble sale most of the time.

I am very, very excited. Thank you so much to anyone who helped with this is any way at all - your contribution has not only helped zoos, but you've genuinely helped to make me really happy.

8wkcil,What's the best way to tell my mum to stop using 'cum' in texts and on Facebook?,"I took Sunday off work because my parents are coming down to see me for the day and we'll get Sunday lunch together at a pub. One subject I want to bring up is mum's use of 'cum' on text messages and on Facebook. She uses text speak a lot, and always replaces 'come' with 'cum' (and 'cud' instead of 'could', 'u' instead of 'you', the usual ones). If it was only I or my family seeing it (like in the text messages) then I wouldn't say anything, but because she comments on my Facebook page and puts loads of public statuses on her own page, my housemates have been ribbing me a lot since they found out about it a couple of weeks ago. There's many, many Facebook comments where she has done it, but even in text messages it reads really awkwardly sometimes. A search on my text app has 225 uses from mum using 'cum' in the year since I got my phone, with examples like:

*""Do you wanna cum at the weekend or next weekend? I can pick u up at the station whenever u want""*

*""If u cum now we can go and choose a bed later on""*

*""Shud I cum another weekend then?""*

*""Not sure ill cum tomorrow cos its important for u to rest up and recuperate after an eventful week""*

*""I suppose it may b better to cum at the same time as dad as can see more light longer and feels better at that time.""*

*""Your sister said shell cum now so I'm trying to sort out dates.""*

*""The diabetic nurse cum today while we were having tea (your dad thought she was cumming on Friday so he wasnt ready)""*

*""Can't wait for u to cum on saturday son.""* (that one was posted on my status on Facebook the other weekend and my housemates literally printscreened it and send it all the time on our house WhatsApp group)

Most messages are fairly normal and fine, but it still feels awkward to receive texts from mum that use 'cum'. But with housemates reading out the Facebook ones all the time, I want to put a stop to it (I worry a housemate will get up my mum's page at a party we are having later on, and I don't want to be embarrassed tonight because there's someone coming who I think is pretty great).

But how can I talk to mum about this without it being awkward? She obviously doesn't know what 'cum' means (compared to just using 'come'), and I don't feel in a great position to explain it to her. But I'm getting sick of my housemates referring to my mum and 'cum', and they will keep doing it because mum posts quite often on Facebook. 

- Do I just ""matter of factly"" tell mum what 'cum' means, or try and approach it differently? (she is quite a serious woman)

- Do I ask dad to leave the table while I explain it? He doesn't really text much (when he does, it is in standard English), but most of all dad is very serious and I'm worried about how he'll react if I start talking about what 'cum' means to my mum and his wife.

- Or do I just not tell her and attempt to ask my housemates to stop mentioning it (I'm doubtful they will)?

I've been thinking about what to do since mum confirmed yesterday that they will come up to see me (I was reminded because she put ""me and ur dad will cum at around 11 son, see u then""), and I've been worrying about tonight because the whole 'ribbing by housemates' about this has really stepped up in the past few days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8wkcil/whats_the_best_way_to_tell_my_mum_to_stop_using/,1530886037.0,198,0.94,62,CasualUK,TopTrumpWANKER

8vgmxb,CasualUK does charity 2 - THE ACTUAL DONATION BIT!,"A happy Monday to everyone, and I hope you've had a marvelous and boozy weekend in the sun. 

Last week you all nominated and voted for charities to be this sub's official charity for the next three months, and the winner with 26% of the vote was [Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM)](https://www.thecalmzone.net/)! 

CALM is focused on male suicide - the largest killer of men under the age of 45. 

Without further ado, **[HERE IS THE LINK TO THE JUSTGIVING PAGE](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/rcasual-uk)**.

If you wish to donate, please give whatever you feel comfortable with, but as a guideline we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in your local.

An enormous thanks from all the mods to everyone who has participated. For anyone who missed all this, the links below will catch you up.

A few years ago, I got to thinking how big would the planets appear in the night sky, if they were as close to Earth as the moon is. Here is an image of Saturn over the Liverpool waterfront. Obviously (because physics) water levels around the world would be all to pot, but if you just ignore the sciencey side of things, it gives an idea of just how big some of our planets are. There's a full write up at the link below.

------

Voting will remain open until the end of Sunday 1st July, at which point we will post the donation page for the winning charity.

Until then, you still have a couple more days to donate to our previous winner Shelter, which you can do [**HERE!**](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/casual-uk)

__________________________________________________ 
**A reminder of the idea and the rules** 
 
- We are going to donate money to a chosen charity every quarter. 1st April, 1st July, 1st October, 1st January. 
 
- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter. 
 

 
- **It must be a registered charity** and It must be UK based. 
 
- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.  
 
- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.

I come back a week later, the same TV is still there, they still don't have any in stock, but it's still out on display anyway. ""Sorry I can't sell you that because someone has reserved it"". WTF.

No, it's not even available on-line in stock anywhere.

So I'm bored, back the next day, wait 20 mins while the only guy in the TV section is serving someone else who's trying to haggle down the price of a new £199 TV. Eventually I ask about the newer model that's in stock: ""Is it worth the extra £400?"", ""Nah not really""

Eventually I find the actual TV I want online somewhere else.

Side note I tried to buy an iron. ""I don't have my wallet do you do Apple Pay?"". ""No"".

8tq3ax,/r/CasualUK does charity round 2 - suggestions thread!,"Good afternoon everyone, I hope you're all well. 

It has been almost three months since we decided to run a quarterly charity crowdfund, in which UK-based charities are nominated and then voted on to select an official CasualUK charity for the following quarter. 

On 1st April you selected Shelter - a housing and homelessness charity - and since then we have raised **£1,264.50!**

Now it is time to start nominating new charities, so that we can put it to a vote and boil it down to a winner by 1st July. The rules are as follows:

- We are going to donate money to a chosen charity every quarter. 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, 1st October. 
 
- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter. 
 
- Please use this thread to nominate your chosen charities. Please include a few lines to explain why this charity is important to you. Please also provide a link to the charity.  
 
- **It must be a registered charity** and It must be UK based. 
 
- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.  
 
- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.
  
- **Please no debating the rights / wrongs of a particular charity.**

So please get nominating/upvoting your favourite charities in the comments. The top 10 will progress to the next voting stage.
 
You also still have one more week to donate to Shelter, and the  link to our JustGiving page is below, along with a link to the previous threads. Massive thanks to everyone for participating!

8tca7i,"[Serious]I believe a horse has been abandoned and has been tied to a tree for about 3 days now with no sign of food or water, who do I need to call to sort this out?","I apologise for the serious and somewhat depressing topic, but I believe this is probably the best place to ask, anyway a horse has been abandoned near my area, as it's been tied to a tree in a pathway for about 3 days now (possibly longer) and I haven't seen any sign of food or water for the horse.

I've tried contacting the RSPCA but they don't deal with horses and the only other helpline I've found (the BHS) isn't open today.


I really do not want to call an ""animal rights"" charity like PETA, so who else is there I could possibly call?

Thanks in advance

She said no that’s for new customers only

I said if I cancel and set it back up to tomorrow as a new customer would I get the cheaper deal?

Yes.

To save the aggro can I not just have the same deal then?

No. Here’s the number to our retention line.

8rtv7e,"This week I have a telephone engineer coming to install a new line, Sky coming to install a new dish and a gas bloke coming to swap my pre-pay meter for a regular one... I have every confidence that all of these things will happen on time and glitch free","Edit: Monday 11am - After several pleasant texts and an actual call the Openreach Engineer arrives well within the allotted 8am-1pm period and parks up outside. Excitedly I run out to greet him with the offer of some lemon madeira cake I baked last night but can tell by his expression that something is amiss. He is not smiling.

Turns out nobody informed him that the telegraph pole to which my new line will be attached is located *across* the road from my house. Consequently he's brought the wrong sort of van in so far that the one he's brought doesn't have a cherry-picker on the back of it.

He telephones cherry-picker control and tells me they'll be back some time this afternoon after they've done a few other jobs... And so it begins...

Edit 2: Monday 1pm - Openreach Engineer has returned and he’s a right rude little bastard. Seems to think it’s my fault he didn’t know he’d need a cherry-picker to run the line across the road. No cups of tea or cake for this bell-end. He can do the work, fuck off and expect my letter of complaint about his attitude forthwith.

Edit 3: Monday 2pm - After some rude and obnoxious behaviour the Openreach engineer has fucked off without even telling me he'd gone. He has, however, managed to put a rather big crater in my 210 year old stone wall with his heavy handed drilling. Got a text from him later that simply said ""Job Completed""

Edit 4: Tuesday 12:15pm - Sky bloke arrives, on time, smiley and chatty, does the business with minimum fuss, has a single glass of Vimto and, 32 minutes later, leaves me with my new Sky Q box sitting warming up on the TV rack in the corner.

Edit 5: Tuesday 1:05pm - Pinch myself to check I'm awake and didn't just dream the visit from Sky bloke. Nope.. It was real! A seamlessly efficient visit with the desired outcome. Well done Sky.. And well done for agreeing to a 30% price drop too!

Edit 6: Wednesday 11:00am - Got a call from the area manager of MJQuinn (Openreach Contractors) regarding my complaint. Had quite the chat about the behaviour and performance of his engineer. Looks like they may be coming back to try to fix the damage they caused.

Edit 7: Wednesday 1:00pm - Gas bloke arrived on time and he's a lovely chap. Had a good chinwag about outdoor pursuits, good walks in the area, the football, the closure of high street shops and Br*xit etc. He did his stuff efficiently (which earned him a brew made with my regular teabags, not the crap ones I use to punish unruly tradesmen). He explained what he was doing, why he was doing it, finished the job, handed me the advisory papers and went on his jolly way..

So, in summary, two of my three visitors were rather splendid and delivered seamlessly. One was a twat who'll hopefully get what's coming to him from his area manager..",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8rtv7e/this_week_i_have_a_telephone_engineer_coming_to/,1529268053.0,64,0.98,21,CasualUK,dronebox

Get home from work and there's no card, nothing. They have no phone number (of course), so I have to live chat them. The guy says it wasn't delivered due to an 'access issue' (the only access issue is that I wasn't home - I live in a house, not a flat, and they could have left it with a neighbour). I ask why no card was left, which he ignored. He tells me there is no depot to pick it up from (again, of course), but I can have it redelivered on Saturday when I will be in. 

Yesterday early afternoon comes and I haven't had a new delivery text, so I start a new live chat. Reassured it will definitely be delivered that day. No parcel arrives. Contact them again - apparently now there is a different issue, and I have to wait until today to contact them. I get annoyed (but not rude or abusive) and my connection to live chat mysteriously cuts out.

So again, today: live chat. Now, they have to do a 'warehouse sweep' to locate the parcel. 

""So, you've lost it then?""

""No, it's not lost. We need to do a warehouse sweep""

""So it's lost?""

""No"".

If you find the flag offensive or racist then, seriously, this may not be the sub for you for the next month and perhaps you should give us a break.

Alternatively you could continue with your opinion but not leave a comment. Remember we're not here for moans or complaints.

I said thanks and everything. I'd have been an hour late to work otherwise. Really good guy and I just wanted to share a happy story.

But that's not the question...

8pzfa2,Top 10 facts about: Beans!,"So I thought as a thing on Sundays I would start a ""top ten facts"" about British institutions or things that are quintessential to these fair isles. 

Figured I'd start with beans since ~~I've been paid to~~ we all love beans, right? 

Without further ado; 

1. There are approximately 465 beans in a standard 415gm can of Heinz beans.

2. The earliest reference to baked beans was in 1832 in a book called American Frugal Housewife.

3. The world record for eating six pounds of baked beans is 1min 48sec by Don Lerman of New York.

4. The Baked Beans Long Course record for eating 8.4lb is 2min 47sec by Sonya Thomas.

5. In April in the House of Lords, Viscount Simon asked Baroness Verma whether smelly emissions from baked beans contribute to global warming.

6. The energy minister said he raised an important point and we do need to moderate our behaviour.

7. The 1967 album The Who Sell Out by The Who featured on its cover a picture of Roger Daltrey sitting in a tub full of Heinz Baked Beanz.

8. In the same year, Heinz launched the slogan Beanz Meanz Heinz, which was recently voted the top advertising slogan of all time.

9. The phrase was created by Maurice Drake, who said it was “written over two pints of beer in The Victoria pub in Mornington Crescent”.

10. One can of Heinz baked beans is sold in the UK every 17 seconds.

So there we go. Which is most interesting to you? Do you have any more interesting bean facts?

Bought a laptop last week for a fair price to be able to walk in and away with it in the spot.  Got some genuinely useful advice.  Found a sound issue, took it back, they had a go at updating drivers in store just to make sure it wasn't anything silly.  To everyone's surprise the problem went away.  Naturally it did come back (hardware issue) so I returned it to swap for a replacement unit on the spot, and saw it was £100 cheaper today - they price matched as it was within 10 days and swapped the unit on the spot as it was within 30 days.  Simply cannot fault that service.  Online it would have meant being without a device whilst it was replaced or repaired, and the driver ""fix"" would have meant another cycle of posting and waiting and staying in for couriers.

I know it's unfashionable to say so, but fuck me that was top notch, and reminded me why I like high street shops still.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8psp1h/currys_well_done_guys_genuinely_impressed/,1528549904.0,406,0.96,78,CasualUK,goldfishpaws

There is no blue verification tick on the page.

8pl5ha,To the family from Norwich that I've had the privilege of meeting at Disney Paris.,"You guys were the most sensational individuals we've ever met. We shared a lot in common despite living an entire ocean across, but being two hard working families, there was a lot to bond over. Whenever I think of people from the UK I will always think of you guys. One thing I'd like anyone reading this to understand is that there wasn't anything particularly special about this family, other than they listened and they cared about what you had to say, and they were just a happy group to be around. For the most part, we never really met anyone in France who were as kind and enjoyable as they were, but that's not to say everyone we encountered were miserable twat's, in fact everyone we met were very lovely, but the Norwich family took the cake. Wish we had exchanged contact info to keep in touch. If by the off chance the dad or mother is on reddit and comes across this, or if you feel the following message describes your family, I mean this from the bottom of my heart (hope this doesn't break any of the sub's rules) - 

For the dad - I hope all is well in the real estate business, and that life in Norwich is treating your family all the best. You were such a down to earth man, my father told me you reminded him of his late brother. Very ambitious, a joy to have around, and very generous. 

For the mom - I truly admire you for choosing to become a teacher. In any country, I hold that profession in high regard. The children you teach are in loving hands, and I hope the work load doesn't break you, believe me when I say you deserve more than what they give.   

For the young kids - I know having a little brother is annoying, but that's no reason to steal his cookie! (Next time make sure you don't get caught, DUH!) 

Lastly, I just want to say to all of you who took the time to read this, you guys have a lot of great amazing people in your country, I have nothing but love for each and every one of you!

TL;DR - Met a beautiful loving family from Norwich, we bonded over the hardships and bright things in life. Love all you guys from the UK. 

Edit: The Family is originally from Manchester, They moved to Norwich in recent years, so they're more of a family from Manchester if anything. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8pl5ha/to_the_family_from_norwich_that_ive_had_the/,1528474149.0,70,0.95,39,CasualUK,Gognoggler21

8pf5m2,An apology,"I would like to extend my heartfelt apologies to the very important and clever people who, rather than accept their fate in the stationary traffic on the M5 this afternoon, figured out the genius move of simply bombing down the hard shoulder. The fact that my knackered old car chose that exact moment to overheat, forcing me to pull into your path and park there for a bit was most unfortunate for all of you and I can honestly say that watching you all struggle to force your way back into a curiously unwelcoming lane 1 brought me no joy at all.

In particular my heart goes out to the charming young lady who, once she did find her way back into the traffic, took the time as she passed to wind down a window and sing me the volubly fascinating song of her people. That she found time to do so with a hysterically bawling 10 year\-old next to her was heart warming enough but I really didn't expect her to make the effort to pull up and walk back to give me a free, if ironic, lecture on manners. Her delightful colloquialisms and generous professed misson to ""alleviate the congestion"" by dangerously flouting traffic law for her own personal gain brought sunshine and hope to a difficult time for me.

The irony was of course that it only took slightly longer for the engine to cool down than it did for everyone behind me to find their way back into the queue. If only you'd all been a little more patient! Funny how it goes.

One weird thing, a sixty ish woman whose husband had simply stuck it out in lane 1 gave me the cheekiest double thumbs up I've seen in a while as they crawled by. No idea why. Maybe seeing an overheated car brought back memories of better, more community minded days.

Anyway, sorry chaps. Next time I'll make sure to buy something newer and BMWer like all you lovely lot so I don't have the same unfortunate and annoyingly timed problem.

8orxbu,Hand dryers - a national scandal,"I was again confronted today with a problem which rumbles beneath the surface of the UK and is endemic from cafés, pubs, universities to train stations. 

Shit hand-dryers. 

We’ve all felt our hearts sink when we’ve washed our hands only to realise that the teachings of Lord Dyson of Airblade haven’t reached the toilet which we find ourselves having the misfortune of having washed our hands in. Instead we’re greeted by those off-white units which seem to leer at you from across the room like that 60 year old called Stacey in the pub, tattoos covering her arms, knowing that one day, when you’re feeling dejected and miserable from a bad break-up, you’ll find yourself lying in her cheetah patterned bed, reeking of stale Marlboros and shame. 

When you do find the ones that actually work, they blow as pathetically as you when you’ve been tricked on your birthday into blowing out re-lighting candles. When you eventually give up, resigning yourself to damp hands when the toilet roll has also ran out, you have to touch the door handle with your moist palms. But, you’re not the first person to have this problem. You touch the handle only to find it already wet - is it piss or water? you find yourself wondering. On your way out you instead dry your hands on your trousers, leaving questionable damp patches for all to see. Then the next person comes in and the cycle repeats itself.

Is it so much to ask to have a hand-dryer that actually dries your hands?

It's now been 4 days since a Golf with P plates parked there, leaving an 8ft gap (not an exaggeration) at the front and rear, meaning only 3 cars instead of the usual 4 can fit on the row. As a Brit, this has forced me to write a note. Not anonymous, because I hate them.

I need your help though. Does this come over as too dickish? I'm trying to be as polite as I can.

*Hi.*

*Can I ask that, in future, you park closer to the car in front? The gap you've left is excessive.*

*Parking space is in rather short supply and leaving a gap this size stops another car from fitting in behind you.*

*I don't want to put you off parking here, you're always welcome to, but please consider some of the other people who need to park too.*

8ogli8,Thoughts on having baked beans or spaghetti hoops with a Sunday roast?,"After losing a bet last night, I've got to make a roast dinner on Sunday for the house where I live. Due to budget issues (and a lack of cooking experience), the plan is to:

- Buy a very discounted cooked whole roast chicken from the Asda deli during my shift (I'm working the Sunday shift, so can put one away). By the time I get home from work, the chicken will almost definitely be cold (although the Sunday bus ride is quicker than during the week, it still takes well over an hour), so I'll just bung it in the microwave for 30 seconds before cutting it up.

- I've got frozen peas/carrots in the freezer already, so I'll do them for veg.

- With potatoes, I'm considering either getting the frozen mash that Asda sells (only a quid and it looks like it'll be enough for everyone) or microwaving the frozen potato waffles I already have (and either serving 'as is' or mashing them up before serving).

- I looked at a pack of Bisto and that looks really easy and cheap to do (boil water, add pack of bisto to a large mug, add boiling water, stir, pour).

- I'm considering adding baked beans or spaghetti hoops (just one tin divided between the 8 of us, so only a very small amount each) too, as I know both are a big favourite with everyone (they are probably the most eaten food in the house after bread and crisps). 

- I was also reading about 'tips' for a roast (here: https://www.netmums.com/easter/spring-sunday-lunches) and saw that adding a lemon is also good for chicken roasts, so I'll add optional slices lemon on a side plate too (only 30p).

I figured I should ask for advice here though, especially about adding baked beans or spagahetti hoops with a roast dinner. I know it's not traditional, but do you reckon it'll be nice? Or will it mess up because of the gravy?

Are there any other easy, cheap ways to fill up the plate? (I'm a bit worried the portions will be quite small)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8ogli8/thoughts_on_having_baked_beans_or_spaghetti_hoops/,1528112527.0,83,0.85,111,CasualUK,TopTrumpWANKER

ghswuk,"I'm going through a male domestic abuse group therapy course, and today changed my life","So a few months back my (amazing yet scarily young) doctor referred me for Male Domestic Abuse counselling and I was enrolled onto an online course, and we have been going through it. Aside from everything I have been keeping to myself being expressed by others in the group, today we were talking about how domestic abuse affects children, and I, who likes to stay quiet, cautiously explained about how I spent my married years being told I was a terrible parent and came to believe it, and how after I divorced finally became the true me. 

As part of me becoming myself, I improved the relationship I had with my kids, but yet I was being continually told that I was being a terrible father, various threats were made, and I was still being attacked on all levels but physically. In less than 15 minutes of me explaining everything, and how my relationship has changed with my kids,  I was responded to in the best possible way - the counselor and my peers all told me that what I was doing was amazing, and that I was doing the best possible for my two. It was like having a weight lifted off me that had been growing for 14 years.

Hopefully with this course I'll be able to build the confidence to be more assertive, and fight more for my boys in helping them fulfill their desire to live with me as a primary carer. They already talk to me about their personal problems than their mother, and have both expressed their desire to move in with me, but after 11 years married, and 5 years divorced, it's like David vs. Goliath+Pennywise combo. Only time will tell I guess.

On reflection, this post may be completely pointless and may get removed, I don't know, but I felt like I needed to say something to someone, and I thought I would give my parents a break.

g2elci,Pestle &amp; Mortar - is this a UK thing?,"Exceedingly specific topic, I realise. You know how in a lot of cases a certain ordering of two or more words just seems more 'right'? As long as I've been around I've known, and referred to the classic druid-derived method of crushing and grinding herbs and spices as a *pestle and mortar*. However, on searching for this on google, I quickly note that almost every mention of said item on the internet calls it a ""mortar and pestle"".

Now, to me at least, that just sounds plain wrong. The cadence isn't nearly as nice. It sounds clunkier. I like pestle and mortar, that's what I'll continue saying. That's me.

Now that that's established...what are other people from the UK familiar with calling it? I'm just wondering if other people have had the same experience. I notice that when searching it for it my way, in quotation marks, on google, most of the results that come up are .co.uk or otherwise British domains. Is this a British variation?

One night a couple friends came to stay the night with there 3 year old daughter. Later that night we are drinking downstairs and their daughter was sleeping upstairs when she comes downstairs and says she can’t sleep because of the noise. We are a bit confused as the pub is closed and it’s just us downstairs. We take her back upstairs and put her back to sleep, about half an hour later she comes down and says that the noise has woken her up again. Me and her dad take her back upstairs and put her back in bed. I ask her were the noise is coming from as I can’t hear anything, she points to the old mirror as says the people on the other side keep coming through and waking her up. That scared the shit out of us, we took her downstairs. The mirror was an old huge mirror, we took it out and put it in the cellar.

8nbw9h,Thank you to all the Firefighters.,"Got home yesterday and we faced a flooding situation.

Rushed down to Screwfix to buy pumps, but after another 3 hours of torrential rain I came to the realisation that we were pissing into the wind.

When the flood water was only 1ft from the house a Fire crew arrived and spread out along the road (rural Kent) and pumped with all their might..

Our house was saved, some neighbours were not so lucky, but without the crew last night we’d all have been fucked.

On what was a shit night for all involved, the crew were nothing but professional, and for that I thank them.

Finished up with my pumps at 4am being thankful for having averted disaster.

It was nice to see neighbours being neighbours and everyone mucking in to help where they could.

Despite what people say (the doom and gloom press) they are a lot of good people out there!

But deep down I was sad and secretly hoping/wishing for rain and a dramatic drop in temperature.

8mrnoi,Walker's French Frys - then and now. A review of 9 year old crisps,"A couple of weeks ago u/dokky found a load of Walkers French Fries that were [nearly 9 years out of date](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8ju3dd/found_half_a_box_of_these_anyone_hungry/), I asked for a pack and he delivered!

So I bought some modern ones and did a comparison. Unfortunately I could only find them in a multipack so have a smaller pack than individually sold ones \(multipack 18g vs 21g for a modern individual pack vs 22g for the old individual pack\).

[Front of pack](https://i.imgur.com/0bEgLhY.jpg)

[Back of pack](https://i.imgur.com/6OKSQo2.jpg?1)

[Crisp comparison](https://i.imgur.com/E6o5LEf.jpg)

**Packaging**

The packaging has been given a revamp, with a new font that looks more like the contents. The new packaging has no mention of Sunseed oil, so I guess Walkers have dumped the branded oil though continue to use sunflower oil. The older one looks to have been following a relatively recent reformulation as it talks about having 45&amp;#37; less salt \(than in 2005\) and 80&amp;#37; less saturated fat \(than in 2006\).

The packaging overall looks less cluttered on the new one, the health focus is less on the saturated fat content and more on having only 79 calories a bag and no artificial colours. The newer packaging also includes allergy advice which is missing on the 2009 version.

The newer bag has been printed at a higher resolution.

**Nutrition**

The new version apparently has more calories \(438 vs 430 per 100g\), however the gram amounts of the contents remain the same \(except salt, which has been reduced from 2.34 to 2.30g per 100g\). Ingredients more or less the same, though wheat flour and malic acid have been dropped from the flavouring recipe.

**Taste**

It will come as no surprise that crisps nearly 9 years past their best before date are past their best. They appear to be edible, you could eat them in a zombie apocalypse but they aren't good. There is no longer really a salt and vinegar flavour just a faint flavour of something not good and they have gone stale. The modern version taste as I remember them tasting in 1997.

Overall I recommend buying a new packet rather than eating ones nearly a decade past their best before date, even though they have 8 more calories per 100g. However, they are also virtually impossible to find not in a mixed flavour multi\-pack so unfortunately those of us who loathe cheese and onion will continue to miss out.

Other 'fun' things happening during the 24 hours include watching some sort of football match while they play, me feeding them quiz questions (including the newly discovered, excellent pub quiz posted on this sub), a dominos pizza dinner and the possibility of two cats strolling in and out of view.

My husband picked The Brain Tumour Charity to support as my mum died from a brain tumour in July 2016, 15 months after she was diagnosed. There's a lot I could tell you about how awful brain tumours are, and how underfunded the research into them has been. Just 19% of adults diagnosed with a brain tumour will be alive 5 years after diagnosis - and that is regardless of whether the tumour is cancerous or not. 

So, please consider tuning in and sending them a message of support - especially if you're up in the middle of the night. Have a fab weekend casualuk-ers!

EDIT:

Wow! Thank you so much for your support with the marathon - watching the stream, taking part in the chat and even donating. The guys are truly touched at the overwhelming support. 11 and a half hours to go!

8m1pxv,When you get a complete arse of a courier trying to deliver,"Had a call at our firm’s delivery gate, which was strange since there’s nothing booked in today, and the warehouse staff are away anyway. I inform the driver of the situation but tell him he’s welcome to try the staff door and I’ll meet him there. It requires the courier having to carry the delivery from the roadside as we have a height-restricted gate. 

I watch him pull up on the security camera, whereby he takes an absolute age to grab 3 shoebox-sized parcels. He comes through the gate and, instead of continuing to the only viable entrance in sight, turns an immediate right and heads through the jungle of a garden we have in the yard, through trees and bushes, squeezes past pallets in the yard, climbs over trolleys that are parked, to the delivery door. 

He hammers on the delivery shutter door, which is locked shut behind steel gates, and stands in the pouring rain. 

I’m at the staff door wondering where he’s gone. 

Eventually, this sodden figure appears with 3 soaked parcels outside the door, and just stands staring at me through the glass. I unlock the door. 

He walks into the door. 

“Mate, the door opens outwards?!” I exclaim. 

He says nothing, shuffles through the door sideways with the parcels against his chest, making the doorway even tighter to get through. Drops them on the floor. One bursts open as its now more water than cardboard. 

Hands me the PDA to sign. 

“Erm” I say. “This is the wrong address. We’re in Catterick, not Barnard Castle”. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8m1pxv/when_you_get_a_complete_arse_of_a_courier_trying/,1527254694.0,60,0.98,10,CasualUK,byjimini

8m0no6,Just pulled off a great save during a group interview.,"So I was doing a group exercise as part of a job interview. One girl had an incredibly confident and domineering personality - immediately taking the lead and stuff. Now this might be fine for some, but I was getting kinda stressed because I also have a domineering personality and I wasn't  given an opportunity to show my leadership skills. 

Anyway, I turned it around. In the individual interview I said that I used my conflict resolution skills by identifying a potential source of conflict (our clashing personalities) and deciding to take the back seat in order to allow the group dynamics to flow and reach the conclusion of the exercise. Or some bollocks like that.

It really impressed them so I'm feeling quite confident and it's a lucky tip to pass onto you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8m0no6/just_pulled_off_a_great_save_during_a_group/,1527243508.0,57,0.9,28,CasualUK,[deleted]

8lqukv,"Went to a ""man club"" on Monday. Not what you think.","So I bit the bullet on Monday and went to a support group for men.

It was not at all what I expected. 20 guys, some of them absolute units (semi pro rugby players and doormen), some earning 6 figures, others working the docks on minimum wage. All just talking about whats good and bad about the past week and given the option to talk if they want to.

I thought I'd share as issues with mental health effects so many of us, and wanted to let you know this resource is available. I can't wait for the next session.

I don't think I can post a link but its called Andys Man Club and has 16 clubs across the UK.

--------------------------------------

EDIT: Didn't expect this to get as much interest as it has. Someone asked what actually happens there so I've copied my answer from below.

I've only been to one so far so it might vary. Not going to give too much personal information as that's the first thing they say when it starts, whatever os said at the meeting is not repeated elsewhere (I don't feel I'm breaking that rule)

So starts of with tea/coffee/hobnobs (biscuits may vary) and people just generally chatting while people come in.

Then when everyone is there, you sit in chairs in a circle. One of the main guys will start it off with a general question like ""why are you here?"". He answered the question and passed a stress ball to the guy next to him who then answered...sounds daunting at first but most answer ""to improve myself"" or something to that effect. The stress ball is good because it gives you something to focus on when you answer instead of making eye contact with strangers, or it allows you to pass it on to the next person if you don't want to answer but equally don't want to explain yourself. The ball is just respected.

Other questions included ""What's a positive from the past week"", ""What's a negative from the past week"" and ""What are you going to try and do before next meeting""...which could be reach out to a friend, take time to relax, put up the shelves that you've been meaning to do for the past year...whatever.

There was then a break and the second half was more about general chat on how to cope with stress.

Hope that gives you an idea of what its like. Its possible to go to a meeting and say nothing at all if you don't want to. The guys there know its hard to open up.

8liitt,Many self-checkouts still take old £1 coins and £10 notes,"Hey folks,

Just thought it worth a mention that I've successfully used up many old notes and coins in various self-service machines. Self-checkouts, parking meters, that sort of thing. Even on some with signs saying they aren't accepting old £1 coins. I'd say I've had an 80% success rate. Save a trip to the bank!

Related tip - if you have a coin jar with lots of spare change. Find a self-checkout with a funnel coin insert and just pour it all in (even if it's way more than you're spending), some machines give change in simple denominations. I've put in £8 or so in smallish change to buy something for around £2 and have a £5 note and coins out as change. Mixed success with this one and don't try it too often to know if I've just gotten lucky or not.

8l8tv5,The Trivial Tale of the Indoor Biscuit,"Alright.

If you were hoping for something interesting then you might aswell bugger off to another thread, because this is the most boring, trivial shit you'll ever read.

So.

Getting ready this morning, I'd woke up late for work. Shower was acting up, landlord wouldnt answer his phone... Basically I'm in a bit of a rush.

I've no time for breakfast, but I'm pretty starving. I tell myself that I'll grab a biscuit to eat on my walk to the train. So I get the tin and grab whatever biscuit is on top, before leaving for work.

And as I'm walking - eating my mint viscount - I have the single most ridiculous, stupid, and *British* thought I've ever had.

&gt;""I really should have grabbed a Kitkat instead. Viscounts are *indoor* biscuits. Now I look fucking ridiculous.""

But see, now I've thought of the concept of an ""indoor biscuit"", it won't go away. 

What counts as an indoor biscuit? Fuck, is there any biscuit that can be eaten outside without threat of ridicule? I mean, I suppose a Twix is fine, but that opens the whole ""chocolate bar Vs biscuit"" debate, and it's too early in the morning for that nonsense.

Is it the wrapper? See, a Breakaway or a Blue Riband seem fine, but eating a custard cream outside is just sacrilege. But then viscounts have wrappers too, but those are *definitely* indoor biscuits.

Maybe it's the shape.

Fuck it, anyway. It's been over an hour now and I need more opinions on the indoor Vs outdoor biscuit debate.

I'm a fucking mess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8l8tv5/the_trivial_tale_of_the_indoor_biscuit/,1526983281.0,128,0.97,51,CasualUK,HiuGregg
8l8te1,Get Rid of Pushy Salespeople by Sneezing on Their Clipboards.,"Morning Casual UK,

So I am off work right now, sick with flu. I was currently on a virtual M25 in traffic hauling acid to London. Dunno what makes having free time from sitting in traffic which makes me want to sit in virtual traffic. I was pulled away from swearing an Audi cutting me up by knocking on the door. 

I am currently looking like a slug, covered in blankets and snot and eventually I oozed down stairs to open the door. There was a salesperson. An apparently illiterate one who can't see signs saying no door to door salespersons. I choke out ""Hello?"" 

Sales Person: ""Hi blah blah double glazing insurance..."" 

I wasn't listening to be fair, I was too busy trying to not to die. ""Um sorry I don't want anything. I don't buy from door to door salespersons."" 

SP: ""Well don't call me that! I am not a sales person just a friend who wants to save you money. Look."" This complete stranger hands me a clipboard. 

I look at it and the tickle started in my nose. I was too exhausted trying to deal with him and it escaped me... I naturally bring my hands up to cover my nose only I had my hands full of clipboard. I sneezed on the clipboard and handed it back wincing. ""Sorry mate. Ill."" 

The guy ran off pretty much after stammering about his colleague will be in touch.

So I went and learned a couple of things:

- sperm is in such high demand in this country that they need to import it from Denmark and America;

- this is doubly true if you want that sweet, sweet blonde and blue sperm, or if you're an ethnic minority;

- very few people are able to donate once you discount those with genetic conditions and those whose wee men don't like the cold.

Wasn't eligible in the end as I'm colourblind but if you are old enough and have a good family medical history I'd urge you to think about it. It's so easy for us and would make a real difference to someone's life.

Luckily I’m reasonably adept so was able to stop. She proceeds to have a go at me and my driving instuctor (and all learner drivers in general) for driving down the road. Her argument is that we are ‘disturbing the peace’ and ‘scaring away animals’. She didn’t listen to a word we said calling my driving instructor a ‘nasty man’ as he politely tried to explain why he took learners down routes like this. She continued to be rude and ignorant and proceed to stare and make gestures as I slowly pulled away.

8kzwug,I just had to kick an unannounced union rep out of our building and things got a little heated when I caught him lying. I think I'll live off this adrenaline for about two years.,"Accidentally hit post before the text input... The adrenaline is to high.

There's only one manager in today and he's normally fifth in command on a full day. He doesn't like doing anything authoritive. I'm just a supervisor, maybe 8th in line, if that. This is my first ""take control"" moment for 5 years.

The union reps have to give notice when they're on premises, health and safety, all that jazz. This guy just strolls in and tells the manager he ""let another manager know."" He didn't. I spent twenty minutes checking on the much loved and company enforced group WhatsApp.

Manager doesn't want to get involved, and I offer to take the lead, the area manager is around and already in a bad mood today, I can't be arsed with the headache if he spots this guy. So in I go.

I do my best to be polite and explain that it's ""upper management"" forcing my hand. The usual things that make it a bit easier. The guy asks if he can phone his boss and get things straightened out, to which I accept, but don't leave the room. I just stand there and maintain eye contact. The energy is amazing. I know he's lying. He knows I know. There's a minute of silence where he tries to wait me out and see if I'll leave, I use every ounce of willpower to not break staring at him. Eventually he just looks up and goes ""thanks mate"" and walks out the staff room. Defeated. 

I follow him out the building and catch him trying to hand leaflets to staff on his way, he throws them back into his bag and walks off.

8kv3wb,Family from germany looking for a contact to local family,"Hi Redditors, 

we're a family (aged 37/36/7/1) from southern germany visiting London. We're interested to get in contact with a local family for an ""intercultural experience"". Where would be a good place in the internet to arrange such a contact?

Alexandra likes reading, writing and travelling. Simon is an engineer, firefighter and into DIY. Both like jazz music. Our girl is 7 and interested in UK culture, dinosaurs and science stuff. Little boy just made his first steps and is so happy about this. 
We're in Camden from 24-28th May 2018. Maybe we can cook together, go for a walk, go to a playground, visit some places, ...
looking forward for your answers!

8jxrvq,Anyone else feel like uni was a waste of time?,"Before I start, I'm posting this here because it's the most active sub I can find where everyone is English (Yanks seem to have a different view of uni to us). I suppose I'll come across as a moaning bastard but this is a bit of a rant and hopefully can be seen as a bit of a warning/advice for people thinking of uni or if you have kids you want to go.

I was one of them kids at school who got good grades but didn't have any idea what I wanted to do in life. So when I turned 18 my teachers and parents say ""go to uni, when you finish you'll know what you want to do. Even if you still don't know, you'll have a degree so can get a good job!"". 

My parents especially wanted me to go because I'd be the first in my family to get the chance to go so was seen as quite a big thing in my family.

I didn't know what I wanted to study, so I was told to just pick the subject I liked most (which was Biology). 

Half-way through I got a little bit disillusioned knowing that it wouldn't get me anywhere, but after talking to my dad he said it would be even worse to quit half way with nothing to show for it so just stick it out. 

Ended up getting a 2.2 (I struggled with it, having got into a good uni through an access-scheme with CCC grades at A-level). Probably shouldn't have been there in the first place, coupled with not really wanting to be there, was never really going to do well.

Anyway, I'm 24 now and after looking for grad jobs / trying to find any permanent job, I'm thinking of just signing up for the military. Get a trade and earn decent money. Since graduation I've gone through months of unemployment punctuated by temporary contracts working at various warehouses/labouring jobs/royal mail at christmas-time.

I really don't see a way out of the cycle I'm in right now. Working min-wage jobs for the rest of my life. Every year more people are graduating with better degrees and better grades so I have no hope at graduate jobs.

The funny thing is, going to uni kind of fucked my social life up as well - I made mates at uni, but because I moved away I didn't really see mates from home often. When I moved back home we'd sort of grown apart, and the mates I made at uni ended up landing good jobs/PhD's etc and moved away, so I gradually lost contact with them as well.

TLDR - Uni kind of fucked my life up. It's stuck me in a cycle of minimum wage work with no social life, and probably depression to go along with that. Right now I think joining the army is the only way to get out of this rut.

To any 16-18 year olds reading this; DON'T GO TO UNI UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, AND MAKE SURE THE DEGREE YOU WANT TO DO WILL LEAD TO A SPECIFIC JOB. I can't be the only person who has been pushed down this route. I can't believe we still push young people to spend £thousands and three+ years of their lives for what will be a waste for most people.

Thanks for reading, just had to get this off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8jxrvq/anyone_else_feel_like_uni_was_a_waste_of_time/,1526499084.0,51,0.91,110,CasualUK,[deleted]

1) member of the public posts a diss on social media about Lidl.

1) woman slags off Lidl's potato via social media.

2) cut straight to a farmer in Jersey banging on about how good his potatoes are.


So where was the invite to the farm on sunny jersey?

we can only assume that stage 2 went horribly wrong, maybe the curb-side 'collection' team identified the wrong person, they put up some resistance and refused to get into the van with the darkened windows, even when force was applied or somesort of 'medical chemical', everything went pear shaped, they had to ditch the corpse and pretend it never happened, they still filmed the Jersey scene though, good for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8jxjkh/ive_noticed_something_sinister_about_the_latest/,1526497337.0,81,0.97,20,CasualUK,miraoister

8ix7ek,The CasualUK Eurovision Megathread!,"This is the big one, ladies and gentlemen! Gear up for an evening of awful pop music, weird set designs, in your face presenters  and good old 'nil point'. **BBC One, 8pm**. This year it's over in Portugal after their dour effort somehow won it last it year. [BBC IPLAYER LINK HERE](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcone)

I don't listen to any of the songs before the event itself, but I assume that our own entry is awful and we've made another attempt to take it seriously. Other important things to note.

- Our spokesperson is the wonderful Mel Geidroyc. Not sure what Sue's up to.

- Australia are here, again. It still doesn't really make sense. Will they have learnt how to cheat like the Australian men's cricket team?

- Have the Irish ever really recovered after 'My Lovely Horse'?

- Will Cristiano Ronaldo be there?

- Which drinking game will prove most successful across the world?

According to the bookies Cyprus are the favourites, followed by Israel and then the Irish. You can get us to win at 350/1 apparently, but you may as well put your money on the floor and say 'take it'

In an vain attempt to make this all look professional, here's the running order! I like the sound of Norway's entry.

8imjzy,Housemate got a budgie and it's incredibly annoying.,"I came home from work yesterday to a bird cage on the kitchen top, with a chirping blue budgie inside it. It turns out a housemate (one of the two who pays rent) got the bird (I don't know if it's a him or a her) 'on a whim' after seeing a local Facebook buying group was selling it with the cage for a few quid just down the road (he'd had a few cans when he made this decision, I think).

Anyway, my bedroom is above the kitchen and the CONSTANT chirping is incredibly annoying, it even harps until pretty late at night (and I need some early night sleeps for the two shifts where I open the deli). I Googled about getting rid of housemate pets and apparently it is possible to stop renters from having pets, but ONLY if it's in the contract when they move in. But this guy is friends with another of the housemates (who's on the mortgage) so we didn't have a contract written when he officially moved in (he moved in properly after a couple of months crashing at ours without paying anything except chipping in for beer crates). 

Is there any way to 'retroactively' draw up a contract that adds 'no pets' as a rule? I'm not against budgies as a concept, but the noise is really annoying and there's already seed shells and feathers on the kitchen top and floor, so I can already see it becoming a bigger issue (bare in mind, this bloke and the rest of the house didn't put the rubbish out after three weeks, so I'm not expecting they'll clean out the budgie and mess either). Also, money is tight and this would be an extra mouth to feed. I've got a day off today so I'm hoping to 'nip this in the bud' before he gets attached to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8imjzy/housemate_got_a_budgie_and_its_incredibly_annoying/,1526032677.0,96,0.93,120,CasualUK,TopTrumpWANKER

8ib0i5,Someone at my uni sent an email to the entire faculty's student body asking for participants for his experiment. Chaos ensues as people use 'reply all' to respond.,"It all started with a student's innocuous email asking for participants in his study for a music degree. One interested person responded to 'all', which included the   [faculty]-students@[uni].co.uk email the original student had used, so this person's email got sent to the entire faculty student body as well. This upset uninterested people, who started asking to be removed from the mailing list (which is impossible, as it's just a list of all students at the faculty), and it also upset some who expressed their indignance about the fact that the student who sent the original email 'somehow' got their email addresses... which they all complained about by also replying to 'all"". As more and more emails started pouring into people's inboxes, more people started complaining about being inundated with emails...by replying to 'all'. And thus the cycle continues. The email thread is currently 89 emails long, and it's still going.

Highlights include:

After a grand total of two emails sent to a
'all', this person is the first to complain about the 'consistent' emails:

&gt; Following on from this email I am now consistently receiving emails re this matter. It is very disturbing and unrelated to me. Please stop the emails.

Then, the requests to be removed from the list start, because people are too dense to realise they can just not respond if they're not interested:

&gt; I dont know who you are can you stop sending me unrelated emails remove me from the list  

One person further down in the thread formally accuses the original sender of cyber bullying:

&gt; To whom this may concern,   
&gt; What is this, get lost you annoying cyber email bully   
&gt; Kind regards

Others find the onslaught of emails disturbing:

&gt; Please remove me from this mailing list, extremely disturbing

&gt; Please remove me. This is ludicrous how you got our emails pertaining to something we are not interested in. Please remove us all. 

One is willing to bribe the original sender into being taken off the list:

&gt; thank you for your offer, i would like to make you a counteroffer of £25 to stop emailing me.

Yet another student makes use of this opportunity to wish his fellow students good luck on one specific forthcoming exam:

&gt; Please dont forget to remove me. good luck with exams for people who have Derivatives exam tomorrow( make sure you go over binomial and swaps.)

And someone wants to be removed from the mailing list for religious reasons:

&gt; Remove me too! Music is prohibited in my religion . Thank you!

All this is interspersed by the occasional email begging people to just stop responding to 'all' and trying to get people to see that they're the ones creating the problem in the first place:

&gt; Everyone replying to this email, can you all please not hit reply all? Check your recipients and CCs before replying. P.S. I replied to all so that everyone can see and not repeat the same.

&gt; MAY I POLITELY SUGGEST YOU DO NOT REPLY to [faculty]-students@[uni].co.uk? WE DON’T ALL NEED TO SEE REPLIES.

&gt; Could you retards stop clicking on “reply all”. Jesus Christ. Is it the first time you’re using an iPhone?

One guy realises replying to 'all' is the problem, yet still wants to be taken off the list anyway:

&gt; OMFG  
&gt; CAN YOU PLEASE STOP REPLYING TO ALL!!!!    
&gt;THE EMAIL WAS SENT BY [student]  &gt; REPLY TO HIM INSTEAD OF FLOODING EVERYBODY ELSE’S MAILBOX WOTH USELESS AND ANNOYING EMAILS  
 &gt; ON THAT NOTE, TAKE ME OFF THE LIST   
&gt; FFS

I'm still getting emails in my inbox as I'm writing this. It's both hilarious and mind-boggling how people can be this dense...

**EDIT**: It stopped at 239 emails. People were getting pretty pissed off near the end:

&gt; STOP CLICKING 'REPLY ALL' TO THIS BLOODY EMAIL!!!! EMAIL THE SENDER INDIVIDUALLY!!!!

&gt; You morons, the reason you're on this list is because your email ends ""@[faculty]"", so therefore you're on the [faculty] mailing list. Pressing ""reply all"" and moaning about it isn't going to help so get a grip and learn how to use emails properly. Were you born yesterday?

&gt; Lmfao istg ur all level 9000 dumb, u wastemen can't tell the OP to remove you bcs look at the mailing list it's from /[faculty]-students@[uni].ac.uk/ -- you can't be removed from that since its the general contact email for all [uni] students;,,;;;_-/  Smh, it's exam semester so I thought ur brains should at least be in working order.

While others find it hilarious:

&gt; Lmfaoooooooooooooo everyone is just replying with remove me and so you're blowing up eachothers mailboxes and it becomes a cycle. You've really all proven yourselves to lack sense.

And some continue to painstakingly explain what's going on in such detail that even a three-year-old could understand it:

&gt; Dear all,

&gt; 1) stop replying to either ALL or [faculty]-students@[uni].ac.uk  
2) you are not part of any nefarious mailing list that you haven't subscribed to. You are, however, a [faculty] student at [uni] and that's why any emails directed to [faculty]-students@[uni].ac.uk will reach you  
3) You cannot opt out of these emails, because this is a channel used by the university and its administrators to disseminate information to [faculty] students.   
4) STOP asking to be removed from the list, then you won't be getting anymore irrelevant emails, except for the odd open call for collaborative music studies or whatever else [uni] thinks might be interesting to [faculty] students.

One threatened to file a report with the university: 

&gt; I am reporting this to the university. In order to get the people blocked who disturb others with these kind of messages.

While one opportunistic student uses the visibility to ask for instagram followers:

&gt; Follow my Instagram. It's @[name]. Might as well get some followers out of this mess. K thanks guys xx

Finally, someone got involved in what looks like some kind of official capacity, though they're not IT and have a student email, so it's likely just one of the original sender's collaborators on the project:

&gt; Dear all,  
On behalf of [student], we do apologise for the inconvenience.  
If you want the chain of messages to stop; please do not “Reply All.” to this message or the previous messages.   
Moreover,  you may simply remove the [faculty]-students@[uni].ac.uk from further correspondences.  
If you are interested in playing the percussion, please contact [student] directly on [student's email]  
Good luck with your revisions and exams.  
Kind regards,

I had a look at /r/Asda and was shocked to see it's being used to share Turkish language links about restoring a woman's virginity.

The top link on the subreddit is this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/asda/comments/8g0azk/k%C4%B1zl%C4%B1k_zar%C4%B1_k%C4%B1zl%C4%B1k_zar%C4%B1_dikimi_bekaret_dikimi/

With this text: *Maiden is one of the most important issues in our country (of Turkey). Many people are wondering if their hymen can be repaired. Repair of the hymen is possible in today's conditions. The maiden stoning is known as the virgin stitch among the people . Due to different reasons, maiden repair can be done. Our societies are preferred because of sociological reasons.*

8h07oy,Slow end to your Friday? Pass the time with my unnecessarily verbose review of the new Ruby Cocoa KitKat.,"I have no idea why I did this.

**Background**

A closely\-related cousin to the far commoner cocoa capsule \(cacao if we're being pretentious \(we are\)\), the new Ruby bean hasn't been on the scene until 2017. Spearheading its insurgence into western confection is Nestlé, whose well\-documented practices of child labour, unethical promotion, manipulation, pollution, price fixing and mislabelling makes them the ideal flagship brand to bring this brand new bean kicking and screaming into as many mouths as possible, whether their underpaid farmers like it or not.

Originally exclusive to Japan \- the land of the rising sun, sake, wasabi and other wild varieties of KitKat flavour – the blushing bar has made its way over to the U.K for a trial period. To satisfy our insatiable English appetites, the western version is not only lengthier than the oriental original \(unnecessarily racist subtext\) but also has a couple of extra fingers stuck in for added girth \(no need\).

Long story short, it's a four\-finger KitKat that looks fabulous and \(probably\) tastes different. Let's take a break and see what Ruby has to say for herself.

**A Study in Pink**

It's a four\-finger KitKat, and like the symptoms of drinking too much strawberry Yazoo, all that was brown is now pink. It's pale pigment prompt a package perusal for telltale ingredients of additional colouring, but I'm happily surprised to find that Ruby is all\-natural. Then I spot the sales pitch and feel a stir of uneasy nostalgia \- “a new, delicious and unique berry flavour experience”. My last unique berry\-flavour experience was as a child and came in the form of Wonkalate – an artificial raspberry\-infused chocolate embedded with green Nerds, E\-numbers and retrospectively awful taste. Coincidentally also a Nestlé product.

Hoping that the subsequent years have taught these Frankensteinian chocolatiers to question the *should* before the *could*, I proceed with caution.

**First impressions**

A party in my mouth that, a bar and a half in, I'm still not sure if I've been invited to. It's sweet in way that I can't pin down and only the sides of my tongue seem to recognise the flavour. Despite what the seizing sides of my mouth muscle are communicating, this lady ain't no sour puss – just a little tart. And yet the nature of the flavour still lurks in the shadows, not quite ready to pounce.

There's another layer to this mystery, Kitkatski \- and I'm not talkin' about the wafers.

**Further Investigation**

In order to experience an unsullied sample of this pink perplexity, a strip search was in order. I excavated chocolate from around the wafer, like Tony Robinson trying to tunnel his way out of Willy Wonka's factory after being kidnapped by Oompa\-Loompas in a case of mistaken identity. This targeted taste\-test unveiled the wolf in kat's clothing. Imagine a bowl of cream cheese icing which is thinking very hard about cranberries. Eat that, and you have a close approximation to what Ruby cocoa chocolate tastes like. A smooth memory of fruit.

**Final Impressions**

Very interesting indeed. Paired with the familiar vanilla wafer, the chocolate's tartness levels out nicely without becoming sweet to the point of undefinition. It's neither divine or unpleasant, but is compelling enough to eat an entire bar, go to the shops for a few more, eat the rest and get a headache – all in a sense of complete bewilderment.

It does genuinely feel like Ruby could become part of the big brand chocolate family, alongside her brown brothers and the albino one that lies forgotten in Cadbury's attic \(rest in peace Dream\). It's a unique taste that feels familiar with a  twist of confusion at the end, and the fact that it's been achieved naturally rather than through a gimmick \(rest in pieces, Wonkalate\) is probably the most weird and wonderful thing about it.

**Verdict \- worth a pop if you've got 80p and a Tesco going spare.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8h07oy/slow_end_to_your_friday_pass_the_time_with_my/,1525448674.0,51,0.98,8,CasualUK,Xxviii_28

8gkeiv,Purple Bricks are a shower. Don’t ever use them.,"Just a word of warning to anyone considering using Purple Bricks. Don’t. 
We made the mistake of thinking we’d save a few quid by using them. £900, and all they do is put the house on a Right Move. We could never get hold of the local agent, didn’t matter what we tried.

When we finally had an offer on the house the buyer got so fed up of PB's solicitors not replying that he pulled out. No chain, cash buyer, didn’t want a survey or searches, should have been a doddle. 

Now we have another buyer and she’s threatening to pull out because three weeks after we accepted her offer PB aren’t replying to her mortgage company or her solicitors. 

I wish I’d read up about how bad they actually are. The evidence is all online. 

Saving a few quid looked good, but I wish we’d used an actual estate agents. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8gkeiv/purple_bricks_are_a_shower_dont_ever_use_them/,1525291303.0,220,0.98,87,CasualUK,[deleted]

Why don't I trust them? Too robotic for my liking, something straight out of /r/TotallyNotRobots. It reminds me that my office job will one day be taken (perhaps forcibly) by a mechanoid armada, slowly marching into the office, their lifeless eyes fixated on their task while they chant ""Debits and credits. Debits and credits. Debits and credits"" in unison.  
 
Part of me wonders whether these standing up people are even people... What if they're an early prototype? Elon Musk's latest enterprise, the electric office worker. Part of me wants to set the fire extinguisher off to see what happens. Perhaps they'll catch fire and melt away into nothing. Perhaps it'll enrage them and I will begin the first human vs droid war.

ekaumm,Upgraded to a PS4/Xbox One or having a spring clear out? Here's how you can help poorly children by donating your old console to a UK hospital.,"I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ek5r4n/lpt_donate_your_old_gaming_systems_and_games_to_a/) and wanted to turn inspiring advice into tangible action through r/CasualUK, because NHS. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one for whom video games are a welcome distraction when things in life are getting me down. They give me something to focus on, providing a form of escapism which stops me thinking about things I don't want to think about. 

In 2001, when I was a child, I spent some time in hospital. For a large portion of this, there was (fortunately) only one other patient, a toddler. Someone from my family was always with me, but I became bored very quickly - even the Goblet of Fire was soon finished. 

However, my dad found an old SNES in one of the boxes of toys at the hospital. He hooked it up to the CRT television and I spent weeks playing Starfox. 

I can only attempt to put into words how effective this was at distracting me from the pain and trauma. When playing games, I forgot I was injured, sad and alone. I was too busy thinking about how to get to the next level to notice my pain; I was happy when completing the level  and I didn't feel alone because I felt part of the game's story. 

You can only think one thing at a time and if you're thinking about playing a game, you're not thinking about whatever that issue is. You can enter [flow] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) when playing video games, which is incredibly helpful when something bad has happened to you.

If you've got an Xbox360 or PS3 lying about/up the loft, it will be much appreciated by children like me, I promise you. 

If you're buying a next gen console this year, or know someone who will be, please think of donating your old console when you upgrade. If the PS5 does as well as PS4 on launch day, just 0.5% of day one buyers donating their old console would put a PS4 or Xbox One in every hospital in the country.

A volunteer can collect your console and its games for a UK hospital at: https://getwellgamers.org.uk/donate/donate-games/

Get Well Gamers will test them and pass them on for use in children's units, or trade obsolete equipment (e.g. PS2 /Wii) in to raise money to buy newer consoles.

Tl;dr being in hospital is not fun, especially for kids. Video games are fun, especially for kids.

8fqdqt,We've got a super-intelligent crow living in our back yard.,"A few weeks ago we bought a window-mounted bird feeder from the RSPB, in the hope of encouraging the smaller birds in the area. It's a little plastic tray with a roof, attached to the kitchen window by suction cups.

After a couple of weeks of it being ignored, we stepped up our game from basic bird seed, adding a fat ball. Within hours, the fat ball had gone. Something had taken the entire thing and buggered off with it. Still no sign of small birds.

Upping the ante further, we added a few morsels of cheese, and some meal worms. Again, both vanished in no time, but the bird seed remained untouched, so we duly topped up the meal worms and the cheese, and waited.

Wednesday this week, and we found the culprit. Entering the kitchen, my other half discovered a bloody great crow standing on the windowledge, craning his neck to get the cheese. Having shooed him off, we reattached the feeder higher up, out of his reach.

Friday. We come home to find the feeder on the ground below the window, and one of the suction cups has gone. Nowhere to be seen. Our friend has been back, thinks I, and he's a spiteful bugger. 

Yesterday afternoon, as we sat in the living room with a brew, wondering what to do about the missing suction cup, we heard a CAW CAW CAW from the kitchen.

There's friend crow, on the window ledge, peering in to the kitchen, accusing us. Of course, he buggered off as we approached the window, but what should we find on the ledge but the missing suction cup.

I had put together a care package and was ready to send it when life hit me sideways, and due to some self harm issues I had to delete my account. 

I don't want to lose touch with my penpal, but I'm terrible with names and didn't write his down.

8fb68b,Heads-up: 50p/unit of alcohol in Scotland from Tuesday 1st. Supermarket example offer today: 20 cans of lager or 18 of cider for £10. Minimum price from Tuesday: £17.60 for the lager and £19.80 for the cider.,"50p minimum price per unit (10ml) of alcohol comes into force on Tuesday the 1st of May 2018. So pretty much the last chance to buy alcohol cheaply if you're so inclined. It'll basically wipe out the lager, beer and cider offers we're used to in the supermarkets and many of the spirit ones as well.  
  
Example minimum price calculations (other alcohol is available):  
&gt; Tennents lager = 20 x 440 x 0.04 = 352ml of alcohol = 35.2 units = £17.60  (Carling equiv)   
&gt; Strongbow cider = 18 x 440 x 0.05 = 396ml = 39.6 units = £19.80  
&gt; Tyskie beer  = 500 x 0.055 = 27.5ml = 2.75 units = £1.38/can  
&gt; Carling lager = 440 x 0.04 = 17.6ml = 1.76 units = £0.88/can  
  
Probably worth adding two that are often described as problem drinks as well:  
&gt; Frosty Jack = 3000 x 0.075 = 225ml = 22.5 units = £11.25 min vs £3.69 in Iceland now  
&gt; Buckfast = 750 x 0.15 = 112.5ml = 11.25 units = £5.63 - No impact on price",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8fb68b/headsup_50punit_of_alcohol_in_scotland_from/,1524831320.0,64,0.96,41,CasualUK,zak75

8ex6yj,So...I took the life in the UK test today,"I passed. Some of the questions: where is the Eden Project, which is a Crown dependency,what is the capital of Northern Ireland, when men and women had the same voting age, why is Maggie Thatcher famous, how is the “invitation to invade” for William of Orange in 1688 known, what should a dog’s collar say, if the Queen needs to be present when we sing the National Anthem, which are courts for minor criminal offences, which flower William Wordsworth wrote about, which country James the I was already king of, which houses were in the War of the Roses, what started in 1939 with the invasion of Poland(seriously) , who is the spiritual leader of the Church of England,who campaigned for women’s votes.

What they didn’t ask, but probably should have: Which is the best biscuit/crisp/chocolate bar/sweet (Chocolate Hobnobs, cheese&amp;onion, Crunchy, Bassets Jelly babies), what to do when someone jumps the queue( tut), what to do when someone jumps the order for the bar (glass them), is it allowed to talk to strangers on pubic transport (in London, so I’m gonna say...are you ‘avin’ a giraffe?), what to do after all the excitement of tutting, glassing and talking to strangers (cuppa tea).

Edit: Also, where did Bonnie Prince Charlie try to raise troops. Edit 2: Who instructed for the Domesday Book to be written, who to tell if you’re being recruited for terrorism (also seriously).Edit 3: between whom is a famous boat race. Edit 4: what kind of system MSPs’s are elected with.

8ejfg7,How do you feel about your town/city centre?,"I recently moved back to my home town of Doncaster after being away for almost twenty years. 
It used to be a fairly nice place. Lots of good shops, a great market, reasonably clean, nice people. It had lots of good pubs, and a great night life. 

Now, it’s a shit hole and not somewhere I go unless I really have to. There’s beggars everywhere, legitimately poor or not - who knows. Lots of drunks, people taking drugs. I actually walked passed a drug deal going on in the town centre. 

The shops are crap. Pound shops, bargain shops, mobile repair shops (judging by which, Doncaster has the highest proportion of broken phones per capita on earth).

8e3b4e,"After almost a year of searching and struggling with depression, I've broken into my field and start Tomorrow!","Since leaving uni i've struggled a lot with depression more so then in uni because I suddenly had no access to counselling. After a really low point I tried brute forcing my way out of it, being aggressively positive to everything I did. Got dressed in the morning? **Fuck yeah, you are a functioning adult! Keep going or I swear I'm going to force you to do something harder.** . 
While this was helping it was very slow going, the turning point came when one night I woke to a serotonine burst. I felt amazing, everything was light and cozy and I wondered if this is what doing drugs was like. A realisation occured to me, it had been 6 months at that point since I felt what being happy was like. I literally forgot. So with this knowledge and my determination to force myself better I tried harder things. 

I know had to start eating better, keeping the house clean, socialising, everytime I slipped I remembered that happy feeling and that If I tried hard enough that would be a routine thing again. 

The biggest mountain to face and the one that triggered the depression; finding a job in my field. After so many rejections my hope was low. I was getting desperate. One of the cleaners I worked with mentioned a company I hadnt heard off and suggested I try it. I went for it, didn't hear a reply for weeks so added it to the pile of rejections and tried to push on. Eventually I got a call back and after 2 interviews, a physical and written exam I got offered a job! An actual career job! Even better it was in investigations, which is a bitch to get into with 0 experience. 

I've never worked in an office, or a prison (where this one is), absolutely no idea what i'm actually meant to be doing or if there are any universal but unspoken office rules?? Also does anyone know what a typical shadowing is like? Am I just going to be awkwardly sat next to someone while they work? I'm worried about messing this up. 

Sorry for the block of text, but I wanted to share what I'm considering one of my biggest achievments. 

**TL;DR: Beat the worst of my depression through sheer brute force and managed to get a job in investigations after almost a year of applying**

EDIT: Thanks for all the support guys, you've made me feel a bit more confident going forward. Hopefully tomorrow goes smoothly. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8e3b4e/after_almost_a_year_of_searching_and_struggling/,1524404613.0,121,0.96,36,CasualUK,Bored_Pigeon

This will obviously vary depending on your age.

playground status to god-like. Even learnt a few tricks as well. Safe to say I peaked at 7 years old.

I'd heard rumours that the bus line I used to take to school had a single double decker running on it. I never saw it, but I always fantasized about how ridiculously awesome it would be to ride on the top deck.

Fast forward to now. I've been living in the UK for over ten years, and I can ride on a double decker multiple times a day if I want to. I always sit on the top, right at the front if possible, and pretend I'm on a really uneventful roller coaster. I don't think I'll ever get bored of it.

8bgugn,I like to think the best of people...,"I almost ran two lads over on a dark country 'A' road the other night at about 9pm. They were a couple of miles from the nearest village crogging (one on handlebars) with no lights, wearing dark tracksuits and trying to avoid puddles in the pouring rain.

After about a mile I thought I better go back and offer them a lift after all, I nearly hit them and if I heard on the news the next day they'd been hit I'd not be able to forgive myself. I turned around to find them again. When I did find them they'd given up crogging and started walking. They were nithered because being typical teenagers they had tracksuits only, no coats or waterproofs. They accepted a lift to the nearest village so they took both wheels off and put the bike in the boot. On the way back they talked very little but told me one of them had had his bike pinched whilst they were out for the day and they'd been walking/crogging for the past 10 miles, during that walk two police cars had passed them. I asked where they were from and took them the whole way home a few miles past my destination. On the whole they seemed somewhat grateful. Teenagers hey?

I know that I did the right thing in this situation, I have two sons (7&amp;23) I know what they can get up. I didn't put myself in any danger, I'm a big lad can handle myself. 

Now on getting home and to work the following day upon telling this tail to people not one of them would have stopped for these boys. I've been getting quips like ""I wonder where they'd been burgling"" or ""Wait until you see a news report of a stolen bike from 'x' village"" even the wife said ""I bet they thought you were a weirdo!""

Is this the general consensus? Would you automatically think they were up to no good?

8abtjs,Did anyone else's secondary school split the Year into French and German Forms?,"So was just at the pub after work with a couple of mates and we were chatting shit about school days. 

I mentioned that at my secondary school the French and German side of my year didn't really mix in classes until we started our GCSE options. And they both didn't have a fucking clue what I was talking about in terms of French and German Forms.

So at my school half the students in each year were sorted into 4 different Forms who had German as their second language class and the other half did French. It meant that from Year 7 to 9 all the mixed classes such as Science and PE were only mixed with a Form from the same language. 

It made Sports Day extra competitive as there was an unofficial France v Germany Medal Table, and during break time footy we also tended to split teams between the two sides. 

We didn't really have a choice over which side you went into though a couple of lads who had French relatives were allowed to switch. I was sorted to do French, for jokes they made our Form Tutor a German teacher! Spanish was one of the GCSE options from Year 10.

I never really questioned this before but apparently this is quite unusual and most schools make either French or German mandatory for all students then the other choice along with Spanish becomes an option at GCSE level.

For context this was 1997-2002 so it may just have been an old way of doing things, it was also a high school in Huddersfield at a village by Last of the Summer Wine country and I know we're weird fucking Hill People from up there!

88xmmf,Finally perfected my triple cooked chips recipe,"King Edward potatoes cut into batons (about the width of your little finger - 1x1cm approx).

Rinse well under cold water to remove starch. 

Bring a pan of water to the boil. Add salt and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda. 

Add the chips, bring back to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. 

Drain and allow to dry completely. 

Bring your chip pan to around 160° and fry the chips in batches for about 1 minute, or until just starting to turn golden. You don't want the temperature to drop too much, so cook them in smaller batches and let it come back up to temperature before the next batch.

Drain well, allow to cool and place in the freezer for a few hours spread out on a tray so they don't stick to each other. 

When you want to serve, bring the oil to around 190/200° and cook the frozen chips for 2-5 minutes, or until golden brown. 

Serve immediately.

https://imgur.com/a/q7HSV

Bicarbonate of soda helps the outside of the chip turn into a potato mush which crisps up better when frying (one quarter teaspoon per litre of water).

Freezing expands the water inside the starchy centres which creates a lovely fluffy interior.

Maris Piper will do, but have less flavour (I think, anyway). King Edwards are your best bet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/88xmmf/finally_perfected_my_triple_cooked_chips_recipe/,1522654456.0,388,0.96,62,CasualUK,vbloke

88tae2,The British Phonetic Alphabet,"So I work in a busy UK call-center for a TV service provider. I'm a more experienced agent so one of my roles involves helping new starts get accustomed to dealing with people on the phone by listening in as they take their first few calls, and giving them pointers. A couple of weeks ago I'm helping this new guy. Nice guy and everything - very polite and such. He is nervous, it's his first call-center job. But nothing extreme, he isn't paralysed with fear. Just the usual first day jitters.

After he has listened to myself taking a few calls, we switch over head-sets and he prepares to take his first call. I explain to him that because we take calls from all over the UK, the most important piece of information we can get from the caller is their postcode. We can put their postcode into our system and check if there are currently any issues in that area. So it's best to try and get this early in the call - preferably as part of the opening greeting. He nods in agreement.

We wait for a few minutes before the first call comes in. When it does, the new agent's opening greeting is perfect and he asks for the caller's postcode right away. The only problem is that the caller is an irate Scouser, the natural enemy of the call-center agent, and it's not the greatest line connection in the world. So the postcode given by the caller is barely coherrent. I don't even catch it properly myself. The new agent puts the postcode into the checker, and to no surprise it returns ""not a valid postcode"" to us.

&amp;nbsp;

Me: ""OK, we have got the postcode wrong. So what we need to do now is repeat what we have back to the caller phonetically""



New-agent: ""I don't know the phonetic alphabet off by heart though.""

Me: ""That's fine - just use any word that fits with the letter. Use first names for example.""

&amp;nbsp;

New-agent: ""Sorry Sir but can I just read that postcode back to you.""

Caller: ""Sure""


New-agent: ""So that's A for Alan, B for Bobby, sixty-nine""

Caller: ""Yup""

New-agent: ""Then 4, C for Carol and N for... N for... ""

&amp;nbsp;

The agent pauses for a second. I watch his eyes look upwards as he racks his brain...

&amp;nbsp;

New-agent: ""And N for Nando's?""

87gydi,/r/CasualUK donates money to charity - THE VOTE!,"Good morning all, and a big thank you to everyone who nominated and voted on charities to be the official /r/CasualUK charity for the next three months.

The top ten nominees have been advanced to the next stage, so without further ado, please submit your votes on [THIS STRAW POLL LINK](https://www.strawpoll.me/15372044).

Please see the nomination thread (linked at the bottom) to remind yourselves of what these charities are all about.

Voting will remain open until Sunday 1st April, at which point we will post the donation page for the winning charity.


__________________________________________________ 
**A reminder of the idea and the rules** 
 
- We are going to donate money to a chosen charity every quarter. 1st April, 1st July, 1st September, 1st December. 
 
- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter. 
 

 
- **It must be a registered charity** and It must be UK based. 
 
- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.  
 
- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.

877zcr,Just wanted to say thank you,"So I posted yesterday that I was running the London Landmarks Half Marathon for Mind, the mental health charity. I had no idea, while I was doing the actual run, that someone I knew linked my Just Giving page in the comments, and by the time I'd finished (and for the rest of the day) my post had blown up, reached r/all, and donations had come in like the clappers. I had people wish me well, share their own histories and reach out to me an extended thanks for people that need help with their mental health. 

Thanks to everyone on Reddit that upvoted, and commented (and the mods for keeping the thread in check): the post went semi viral and the online donations tripled in a matter of hours. And of course, thank you to everyone that donated, too. I tried my best to say thanks to everyone but some were anonymous, so this is my ""thank you"" if you're reading. For anyone that's interested, I set a goal of £500, but that was completely smashed - combining online with my offline (cash) donations, I have raised over £1000 that has already gone to the charity. 

Sometimes the Internet can be vile, and other times it can be a really nice place. I don't ever expect this to happen again, but it has touched me too. I will be running another half in June for Great Ormond Street Hospital and this situation has inspired me to do even better next time with the fundraising.

Thank you all so much. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/877zcr/just_wanted_to_say_thank_you/,1522058906.0,436,0.97,54,CasualUK,faithlessMia

86sog9,"PSA: Don't forget to put your clocks forward 1 hour at 1am tomorrow morning, Sunday March 25th.","* William Willett pioneered the idea of British Summer Time in 1907 through a pamphlet entitled “A Waste of Daylight” advising countrymen to get up earlier.

* Willett was a keen golfer who was frustrated by having his games cut short by nightfall.

* British Parliament blocked his idea, however, and Willett died at age 58 in 1915 without ever seeing his idea come to fruition.

* Willett is also the great-great-grandfather of Coldplay singer Chris Martin.

* The First World War made the issue of daylight more important because of the need to save coal.

* Iceland, Belarus and Russia are the only European countries to opt out of this system and instead remain on the same time all year round.

* In 1968 Britain entered a three-year experiment, confusingly called British Standard Time. 

* The country ran one hour ahead of Greenwich until 1971.

* An easy way to remember if the clocks go backwards or forwards is the mantra: Spring Back, Fall Over.

86jv8e,/r/CasualUK donates money to charity!,"[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/86aif7/interest_thread_rcasualuk_is_up_to_some_good/). 
 
Some fantastic feedback and some very generous people on this subreddit! Reddit often gets a bad press but I think that all of us can change that and do some wonderful things for some wonderful charities.
__________________________________________________ 
**The idea and the rules** 
 
- We are going to donate money to a chosen charity every quarter. 1st April, 1st July, 1st September, 1st December. 
 
- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter. 
 
- Please use this thread to nominate your chosen charities. Please include a few lines to explain why this charity is important to you. Please also provide a link to the charity.  
 
- **It must be a registered charity** and It must be UK based. 
 
- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.  
 
- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.
  
- **Please no debating the rights / wrongs of a particular charity.** 
 
- This thread will remain up until the end of **Monday 26th March** when we will do the strawpoll thread.

ejdx5m,The Mystery of the Richmond Sausage,"Frankly yesterday was a strange day. we witnessed a real life mystery unfold in our back garden in London. 

I noticed our young dog was standing in an unusual pose over a peate grow bag (used for growing tomato plants this summer) with his face fully submerged in the dirt, burrowing away and making all sorts of noises. 

I watched for a few mins, trying to guess what he was doing, but after a few more mins of standing in this pose, I settled on he's just being a mad puppy. 

Once I pushed him away from the ever-increasing crater in the grow bag, he jumped back and quickly showed me he had a whole cooked bbq sasuage in his mouth. I was stunned and taken aback. Am I having an episode? Should I cut down on psychedelics? Or did my dog just really pull out a full cooked (and untouched) BBQ sasuage from the bottom of a grow bag?!?

As I moved closer to grab the sausage from his jaw, he quickly gobbled the sausage down in two large gulps whilst never breaking eye contact, which was a little unnerving to be honest. But seriously did I just see my dog pull out a sausage from the dirt or did i just imagine it?

I decided to message Ann, my partner, and tell her what just happened, taking a picture of the new tunnel the puppy had dug under London. When I went to send the picture of the hole, i noticed something - something brown and shiny in the grey sunlight...there was another sasuage at the bottom of the grow bag!? Seriously WTF?

Now, we are living a real life mystery. Who the actual f would bury a sausage in a grow bag??

Ann and I, being fans of Forensic Files (on netfucks) wanted to employ the methods we have seen on the show, to uncover this monster. I was even tempted to do a ""heated super glue analysis"" on the sasuage to lift a finger print as we had seen on the show, but Ann said no. She's right though, finger printing friends and family as they enter our home isnt very welcoming.

Once we examined the 2nd sausage in more detail, Ann noticed that it very much resembled a Richmond sausage, a brand common in UK supermarkets and a good breakfast sausage for when you are hungover and close to death. However, we would never bbq a Richmond sausage? This mystery just deepens....maybe we should finger print our family / friends afterall?

So what now and how do we move on? 
Our dog now thinks there's an unlimited pit of sausages at the bottom of every grow bag he sees and he's still digging for a 3rd sausage without any success, but his crater has connected up with the London Underground making the morning commute a lot easier. 

As for finding the culprit of this pork travesty, we have a few theories but we need YOUR help /advice on how to whittle the suspects down.

Working theories:

1. Would an animal, maybe a squirrel, hide sausages? We thought squirrels just ate nuts and seeds, but maybe the London squirrel has evolved into meat eaters? #zombieapocalypse 

2. We have to draw up a list of everyone who attended one of our bbqs or parties in the last 6 months. Interviewing each suspect with the skills we have learnt from Forensic Files and playing LA Noire (bashing bad cop button everytime!).

3. Start profiling this potential suspect, using our TV knowledge from Mindhunter. Is the crime organised or disorganised? Is it sexually motivated? Is it likely to be someone who is very drunk or have been given the puppy eyes by the dog and guilted into hiding the sausage (oooh)?...but surely they would have given the sausages up at the time their eyes met? So many questions.

4. Obviously the puppy would have scoffed the sausages once in reach and he can be ruled out, but what was the motive behind this sasuage scandal? 

5. How much of the case info should we release to our friends/family? Maybe we should hold back info and see if anyone slips up, giving themself away? 

6. How long were the sausages in the bag? The puppy surely would have smelt the sausages, seeing as it's only buried in 3/4cm. Maybe it was a squirrel or a bird that deposited the sausages in question? We need to get some wildlife experts involved. 

We will keep you updated on our investigation and have images of the evidence if anyone is interested.

Truly puzzled,

ej2apm,Musings from a 10 day trip (and some pics),"Not been back to the UK for 3 years since I emigrated. Had a wonderful trip, some pics below. We rented a house near Ashley-De-La-Zouch so we were fairly central for family. In 10 days we had *21* visitors, so yeah it was a pretty busy week or so.  

My two eldest are getting older, may be the last time we all travel as a family :(


**Images**
https://imgur.com/a/g8gZic2  



**Musings**  

* Supermarket food is still so much cheaper than Southern California (where we live now).  

* Eating out a little more expensive but not that much (we were in the midlands so medium prices)  

* Drivers are *so* much better. I know people complain a lot about drumb drivers, but you have no idea how that compares to California drivers!   

* Greggs trips - 3. There seem to be more Greggs than coffee shops these days. When we went to Burton, I could see three of them from where I was standing on a street.

86jo6t,Office food and the seven deadly sins.,"When God made the world, he also made food, and it was good. The people were happy. They were happy until God also made offices and forced people to eat near each other. In doing so, he created 'the seven deadly sins' which we see below.
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Lust** 
 
It is impossible to go out for a delicious Friday treat meal and bring it back without a horde of idiots gathering round your desk to ogle at your food whilst going ""Mmmm. That looks good! Mm, ooo where's that from"" and then they stare at mouthful. Fuck off!
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Gluttony** 
  
A colleague brings his lunch in every day in order to save money, but by 9:30am, he's devoured every last morsel of food. This means he has to go out at lunchtime to get a second lunch as he smashed his one just after breakfast. His great money saving idea actually costs *more* money than if he just didn't make his own lunch. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Greed** 
 
""Where are the bloody biscuits?"" is a phrase I have heard twice this morning already... Every office I have worked in, there is always an abundance of cake/biscuits/chocolate every two desks where people will gather round to gorge like a herd of zebra at an oasis.  
 
Sitting pretty still in a chair for 8 hours a day makes it hard to justify such an abundant feast but them's the rules!
 
__________________________________________________  
**Sloth** 
 
This one follows on from greed and is namely that although the oasis is a wondrous place, it needs to be preserved and nurtured. It needs people to venture out to the shops to bring more food, otherwise it disappears. Do they ever go and get supplies? Nahh, because that means getting in the lift and going down a few floors. I'm sure someone else will do it.
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Wrath** 
 
This goes out to everyone who microwaves fish in the office. Why are you like this? Why do you hate us that much that you are literally radiating a sloppy piece of haddock at maximum wattage. Who taught you that this is an okay thing to do? Eat your putrid fish at home. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Envy** 
  
Looking like Ron Weasley holding his balled up cheese and marmite sandwiches, they'll sheepishly say ""yours looks better than mine"" (and not just at the urinal). I am sorry that you do not know how to make a meal but don't it my problem. Either learn to make food or go out and buy food because you're not getting mine.
__________________________________________________ 
**Pride** 
 
Every office has that cretin who judges everything that you put in your face. ""That has a lot of calories!"" they'll splutter if you eat a bar of chocolate. ""That's your second cup of coffee. Coffee causes cancer dontchaknow?!"". ""Drinking more water today I see. Don't forget, cancer"".  
 
At least if I end up choking to death on my lunch I'll be left in peace. 
 
__________________________________________________________________________ 
 
**Tell me about your office and it's biblical connotations.**

I'm thinking we could try and do something good instead by running a quarterly/bi-annual/annual donation to charity from /r/CasualUK. Rules so far: 
 
- We create a thread where people can nominate a specific charity and write a few lines as to why that charity means so much to them. 
 
- We have a strawpoll thread with the top ten nominated charities. The winner is /r/CasualUK's charity of choice.  
 
- We create a JustGiving page and whoever wants to donate to that charity can do so. We then pass it on to the charity with thanks from /r/CasualUK.
 
It will be moderator run and we will be transparent all the way so you know that we're not secretly pocketing the cash or anything stupid.  
 
Even if 500 people donate £1, that's not bad going!
 
What do you think? Ideas and suggestions welcome!

Hello, r/CasualUK.

In a band that plays original songs which our bassist has just left for personal reasons. We play alternative/garage rock dosed with LSD, looking to replace him as soon as possible. 

We rent rehearsal space on the Wirral so if you're based in liverpool, and need a lift I can pick you up and drop you off.

Private message me if you're interested, all we ask for is 2 nights a week to tighten up songs and practice for upcoming gigs. We have a Facebook and a soundcloud account of you want to hear the songs first.

85iymu,I've literally been mugged off. Please advise.,"Update: mug reclaimed. No glassing was necessary.

At my office there are a fair few company-branded mugs but for whatever reason they tend to collate on the other side of the building and I can't be bothered with hunting them down.  

Obviously I'm not the sort of cunt who would just go into the cupboard and grab someone's clearly personal mug, so I wound up buying one the other day. It's an Iron Maiden one. It has a nice big handle and holds a solid quantity of tea. It's a good mug.  

I've not even had it a week and it's vanished from the cupboard today. I couldn't find it in any dishwasher and concluded someone had nicked it, which is pretty poor form.  

Now I've twice seen one of the lads who works for services (i.e. health and safety, supplies, etc.) with it and obviously being British born and raised I've not said anything.  

How do I deal with this? He doesn't even have a desk that I can just nick it back from when he isn't looking. I could just use one of the company-branded communal ones but that feels a lot like losing.

EDIT: I've just seen the cunt walking around sans mug. It's unattended! Off on a raiding mission.  

EDIT II: he has cunningly hidden it. It's not in any of the dishwashers.  

EDIT III: I'm going to search all three floors on my way to lunch and see if I can nab it off a desk or wherever he has left it.

EDIT IV: no luck but I did find another Iron Maiden mug. Tempting to steal it and become what I hated most.

85bp7y,"A tale about my birthday weekend, betrayal, friendship and mystery fecal matter.","Bit of a long story, but I shit you not this all happened and I felt the need to share.

It’s my Birthday weekend so I’m obviously out for a few pints on the Friday. Classic hungover Saturday me and the girlfriend get some breakfast, we see some of our friends who had also been out the night before. They’re getting some breakfast, then they’re off to the pub to do some good old day drinking, but fuck that me and the Mrs are going back to bed with our food.

After a day of eating and watching shit TV we go for an early night, only to be woken up at about half 1 in the morning to loads of banging on my front door and the doorbell going. What the fuck, what is going on and why is there someone trying to kick down my door.

So I go down and find my friend I’d seen earlier that day, Jack, absolutely piss wet through without a coat, covered in snow and about as smashed as you’d expect from someone on the two day sesh. He’s mumbling about how he tried walking home in the blizzard but he had to turn back and he loves me and he’s sorry for turning up out of the blue, no worries. 

I can tell he just needs a bed to sleep in and to get his wet clothes on the radiator. So I guide him to the spare room and tuck him into bed and return to my GF and explain the situation, she fully understands and sees the humour.

Now I fall back to sleep, but am awoken to the sound of drunken stumbling and footsteps, Jack has risen at about 3am and I know what this is. Jack is just letting loose not knowing where he is, pissing all over my spare room.

So I'm shouting “Jack! Are you pissing?”, he’s confused, and he deadpan looks at me cock in hand and says: ""This isn't a toilet? Sure looks like a toilet"". 

No, Jack, this is not the fucking toilet.

I guide him to the toilet where he finishes up his piss, then I do my best to mop up the piss in the spare room and send him back to bed, again he wants a cuddle, a kiss and to be tucked in. I oblige, the poor soul.

Back to sleep.

I'm half awake, aware of the beast upstairs, but dozing off for a couple of hours.

I hear banging again. What is he doing now?

So I go up, and turn the light on. No, Jack, what are you doing.

Jack is stood struggling with one of my large speakers in his arms, confused about what’s going on, and trying to get to the wardrobe to piss (The speaker lives on a stand in front of the wardrobe).

So I take the speaker off him and put it away, then I once again lead him to the toilet and back up to bed.

Back to sleep.

So I wake up in the morning, all seems fine, I take him up a brew and some cocodamol to ease his inevitable hangover and he is dead to the world but still breathing when I get there, his worldly possessions next to him. Fuck it he can sleep a bit longer the poor bugger. 
Pictured: https://i.imgur.com/t8CriTE.jpg

At this point I start messaging our mates on whatsapp and the group chat asking if anyone had been with Jack last night. Our mate Tom replies, in full fury saying how much of a dickhead Jack is for taking his key and locking him out. 

Now, it turns out Tom had been with Jack and said he could kip at his whilst he stayed out a bit longer, but that Jack would have to make sure he left the door open for him. As you can tell from the above Jack and the key did not make it to Toms house, leaving Tom stuck outside in the blizzard. See Toms texts to Jack:

https://i.imgur.com/2Q6L3qU.png
https://i.imgur.com/yMPsmer.png


This development had genuinely tickled me, and Jack had now woken up and joined me and the GF downstairs watching TV. Tom at this point was on his way to mine to get his key and slap Jack.

Enter Tom.

Hilarity ensues as Tom tells Jack how angry he is, Jack is just apologising for everything, for the locking out, for the pissing, for the waking me up.

Ok the situation settles, all in good fun it is a funny situation.

Ok Jack, before you head off I'll just make sure you've not forgotten anything. So I go up and sweet jesus the room smells. At this point I have to come back down to Tom and Jack and my GF.

I ask:

""Jack, I'm not taking the piss, but have you actually shit yourself in the spare room?""

Yes, it would appear, Jack has shit himself in the night.

https://i.imgur.com/bZEqx7V.jpg

I now have to just chuck this lot in the bin, it’s a write off. But Jack is claiming innocence here, he is adamant he did not shit the bed.

So what do you reckon? Did Jack shit the bed? Did he bring the shit with him? Why am I friends with these people?

84u67q,"Toilet shopping is a right old faff these days, isn't it?","I've recently had occasion to purchase a toilet. Like most men I'd naively assumed this would mean going to a shop, saying ""I'd like a toilet please"" to which the shopkeeper would say, ""certainly sir, one toilet coming right up"". Of course, an hour in the showroom later we have a 114 page catalogue containing a world of possibilities I'd never imagined to exist. Slimline toilets. Wall mounted toilets. Toilets that swing from the ceiling on a chain. GraviTurd disposal technology and rimless flush systems. Quick release seats for those with a bathroom big enough to play Ultimate Frisbee in.

I find this highly confusing as I grew up in a world where there were only two types of toilet. Most households had the Royal Doulton Mark Two, either the '70s Mk2a available in harvest gold, avocado and peach or the '80s Mk2b in either grey or pink. The Mark Two was the Austin 1100 of toilets, in that your dad would spend all weekend greasing joints and adjusting valve clearances, only for the thing to still leak constantly and break down when you were already late for school.

Sometimes, though, you'd visit elderly relatives in London, back when houses in London cost 50p and the only people who lived there were elderly relatives. Their houses would still be fitted with an original Mark One Toilet (patent pending). It would be kept in a special reinforced room away from the sink and bath, to avoid damage to those lesser items of sanitaryware. Even before you flushed it, the high-level cistern would hiss and clank, warning of the destructive energy stored therein. The black plastic seat would be at a year-round temperature of 6 Kelvin to deter prolonged dithering. Then, you'd pull the chain. Initially, nothing would happen. Then an ominous clonk. The house would rattle to its foundations. Dust would drift down from the lath and plaster ceiling. Then, maybe four or five minutes later, an unceasing torrent of water would wash everything up to and including whole civilisations down the pan. Cans would fall from kitchen cupboards. The water company would issue a hosepipe ban. It would be another eight months before the cistern was full again.

This is what I want from toilet shopping. A mimeographed flyer containing little more than ""Mk2c (available in three ugly colours) / Mk1 (structural engineer approval required)"". Instead I've got War and Peace translated into available toilet options. Er, are soft close seats worth it?

Was meant to start at 9:38 so got down to the industrial estate it's on around 8 and started practising manoeuvres and what not. 

Got into the test centre around half 9 only to find out that my test was at 9:18 not 9:38 and I'd left it too long now to sit it for today, so I've had to rebook for a months time at a total cost of about £110 for the test and the car booked for two hours. 

Worst part is I was sat watching the previous tests (that I should have been on) go out with my instructor. Commenting on the free parking space chatting to him about ""what kind of wanker would book a test and not show up??"".

82wdfa,"Today is international women's day.....however, it's also World Kidney Day!","Kidney disease affects approximately 2.6 million people in England alone, and disproportionately affects women more than men. 

There is no cure other than transplant. 

People who are going into renal failure require regular dialysis, or they will die. 

Kidney disease is also something that affects me personally. 

A few years ago, I lost my dad due to polycystic kidney disease. This is a genetic condition which causes the kidneys to develop cysts and then shutdown. There is a 50:50 chance that I have it. 

Last weekend, I entered into the Southampton half-Marathon and I am now raising funds for the polycystic kidney disease charity. They're a charity who offer support and information to sufferers and their families, as well as help to find research on this condition which affects more than 1 in every 1000 people. 

If you could check out my just giving page, I'd really appreciate it: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/mmacgregor

82r0t4,I resigned today - thank Christ for that.,"Here's how my yesterday and today has gone:

Yesterday Morning: my director waddles up to my desk, bitches about my staff while they're in ear shot and talks about how when he had my role, he would have fired the lot of them.

Then proceeds to tell me he's just paid 6 figures for a piece of software for the company that we have no need for, and I'd rejected, but who's Head of Marketing took him to a ""simply superb"" dinner a few nights ago. So...... screw all that. This is just the last in a long series of bat shit crazy decisions taken over lovely lunches and fabulous days out. 

Lunchtime: talk to the people at the recruitment agency.... ""good lord OlderJack, talk to these fellows over here tout sweet"". Talk to the nice people who are offering the contract,Nice People are very nice. Nice People check I'll be OK with the day-rate. Hear the day rate, choke back a shriek, very calmly assure them I can make it work, spend the rest of the afternoon wondering what it'll be like being Scrooge McDuck. 

Today - emergency sicky, dress up in suit, be interviewed by Nice People face-to-face, Nice People are wearing tshirts and have a ping pong table, but I don't hold it against them. 

Nice People ask if I can start on Monday. I look confused and ask what month. They look confused, and - frankly - like I'm a little dense and explain they mean in 5 days time. 

Headed back to the office with fantasies of shouting ""damn you all to heck"" and being very American  about the whole resigning thing. Somehow that turned into a polite letter and an even more polite conversation where I apologised for leaving and the inconvienience it would cause.

Much grumpiness from Director about him being left in the lurch. Feel not a jot of remorse about that. Feel sad about my teams, apologise to my teams. Take teams for beer, teams are now happier. 

So .... that was my day. I hope yours was OK as well.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/82r0t4/i_resigned_today_thank_christ_for_that/,1520450947.0,193,0.98,41,CasualUK,OlderJack12345

81xjqz,Some nob stole my Dominos last night and I'm still furious about it,"I ordered a Dominos last night at about half 8, well hungry as I'd been in bed most of the afternoon with an absolutely banging headache. I sat there hungrily creating the perfect meal, large custom pizza, chicken sides, potato wedges, a bottle of Coke, a true masterpiece. I'm well up for a nice pizza and a cuddle with the missus with an episode of QI.

I'm sitting there watching the little guy tick over from Order, to Prep, to Baking, to Quality Check, back to Prep again \(who knows what happened there\), back to Baking and Quality Check and then *finally* out for delivery. I'm watching the little car on the app slowly make its way to my house, until... nothing. The knock never comes, the app says it's been delivered and that smug prick Dom is telling me to enjoy my meal.

So I give it 10 minutes until I finally muster up the courage to phone Dominos and coyly ask where my fucking pizza is. it's 10pm at this point and me and the missus are absolutely Hank Marvin. They say they delivered it, the delivery driver has gone out on another run and after a few minutes of them in a panic discussing it:

&gt;Dominaut A: ""what do you mean they haven't got it""  

&gt;Dominaut B: ""11 *A*?""  

&gt;Dominaut A: ""shit""  

&gt;Dominaut C: ""what are we gonna do""  

&gt;Dominaut A: ""we're just going to have to make it again""

So yeah they're going to have to make it again and it's going to be about 20 minutes. Okay. Fine. 20 minutes.

*10 minutes later* I hear a knock at the door and go to answer it. Nobody's there. At my feet is a small pile of Dominos boxes. I pick them up. Empty. I bring it inside and open it, nearly all the boxes are empty except for the pizza box, which is full of crusts, and the chick\-n\-mix box which is full of other assorted half eaten scraps.

I phone Dominos up to tell them what just happened.

&gt;Me: Hi, yeah it's me the guy with the stolen pizzas  

&gt;Dominaut: Oh yeah, 11A?  

&gt;Me: Yeah, err, they've just turned up, empty, on my doorstep.  

&gt;\(I am on speakerphone at this point\)  

&gt;Dominaut: Oh. Err, okay.  

&gt;Me: Do you know where they were actually delivered it?  

&gt;Dominaut: I'm afraid the driver's gone on another run, but there should be someone with your fresh pizza coming in about 10 minutes

It is now 10:20, I'm about to enter a diabetic coma hunting the house for scraps \(we're out of the traditional British snow bread and milk meal\) and the delivery driver finally turns up. We explain why we have a load of empty pizza boxes in our hallway, and she is in hysterics. We're trying to explain this whilst on the edge of mauling her for our pizzas. She left and we finally got to enjoy our pizza.

So here's what I want to know. Nicking a pizza that's been paid for and delivered to you by mistake? Fine. The only person losing out here is Dominos and they're just going to eat the cost of that anyway. You just blagged yourself some good pizza at the expense of my time and Dominos' bottom line. The bit I don't get is the knock\-and\-run fly tipping of the leftovers. *What happened here. Why would you rub it in our faces like that.* We're still trying to figure it out. Our best guess is it got delivered to one of the neighbours, they ate it without realising and then in a panic after they realise*d the box has my fucking address on it and they didn't order any piz*za they did the knock of shame and dropped off the leftovers.

81pd0x,Hairy arsed Step-son broke my bath,"30 year old hairy cracked, hairy backed, hairy legged fucknut decided to defoliate with the agent orange version of hair removal tools Imac - Over a period of 4 days.

Bath has been blocked for 3 days now and assaulted with a variety of chemicals and frenzied plunging by myself.

Upside of this is that it appears his arse shrapnel had collected in the angle joint of the drain where it exits the house. In a variety of the frozen.boiler condensate pipe treatment I've just been up my ladders in the shitty snow and ice, with a boiled kettle to soften his iced up fluffberg.

Fucker did nothing but Xbox and sleep, but only has one bald leg, so I guess that's some form of justice.





UPDATE:

On returning home yesterday evening, we were somewhat aghast to discover what could only be described as a series of extra large spunk like stains tracking across our dining room ceiling. Almost as if a large Silverback had been lying there having frenzied thoughts about Sigourney Weaver.

To cut to the chase, it would appear my own frenzied plungering in the bath, (something I normally keep to myself!!!) had dislodged the seals on the U-Bend and trap. The remains of yesterday evening were spent doubled up in a 1 foot space, removing the U'ey, cleaning, tightening and refitting, to only cross thread the fucking bastard connector to the now unblocked waste pipe, for fucks sake.

UPDATE 2:

Called in the cavalry, in the form of a Master Builder friend, who after detailed inspection has declared the U-Bend off the bath a plumbers job. The connector wasn't cross threaded, but the waste pipe from the sink is at such and angle that the joints can't be joined up level. Guess it's lasted 15 odd year, which he was amazed at, seeing it is such a complex mass of pipes for what should just be a simple U-Bend. 

Hairy crack has just arisen. Hope he enjoys his fucking Veetabix :)

7zo616,Are there any regulations/laws stopping a residential property from having a communal urinal installed?,"I live in a house with a group of males (eight of us altogether), and it only has one toilet. On nights where we're going through a few cases of beer, that can be a problem - with pissing in bottles or the kitchen sink often the go-to way when the toilet is busy and you're busting. 

Anyway, the room next to the toilet is spare, and it's currently just used to store boxes and cases. We had a house chat last night and decided it makes sense to convert that room into a communal urinal (like you get in pubs) to avoid the regular issue of having nowhere to piss. 

Between the eight of us, a communal urinal comes in at around £40 each (to buy the unit and install - the latter we can do ourselves). But I can't find any information about whether it's actually legal to have one, or whether we need to ask the council for permission.

Does anyone know? 

Edit: Just to add, I know we could get the price down much lower if we get a secondhand one (such as this one: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/stainless-steel-urinal-/112826235516), we're deciding on that tonight (I'd personally rather have a new one, but I know two of the housemates have a really tight budget).",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7zo616/are_there_any_regulationslaws_stopping_a/,1519393952.0,357,0.98,203,CasualUK,TopTrumpWANKER

7yx8i8,[Flair Request] Newcastle Brown Ale,"Sometimes the people of Newcastle feel left out, for example we never get hosepipe bans or nobody wants to build additional runways at our airport, and don't even get me started on HS2. So I plead to the mods, please give us what we have dreamed of all along, a Newcastle Brown Ale flair. 

Now I know some of you will say ""but you already have a Greggs flair? What more can you want? Bloody Northerner!"" Well the people of the South-West have Thatchers and Doom Bar flairs so that argument is immediately invalid and racist so don't bother bringing it up. 

If it happens, this will be the greatest thing to happen to Newcastle since the horse punch Tyne-Wear Derby incident or maybe even the Gazza chicken nuggets and fishing rod moment. 

Please mods, do what is right.

7wtxkq,"I am socially lost, depressed, and don't know what to do.","Apologies if this isn’t really the right place for this sort of post but I am in the UK and have browsed the subreddit for a while so it seemed appropriate. I also apologise for the long rant/post and excessive details about myself but I feel I need to get these things off my chest.

I am 21 and for the past 2.5 years, I have had no real friends or social interaction outside of work. I left college in 2015 and never really spoke again to the friends I had there. After I left college, I chose to do a degree with the Open University since during college I was quite introverted and afraid that, if I went to a real university, I would hate living with other people and the general experience. I am still doing my degree and am roughly 6 months away from finishing it, however, I now think it was a mistake to not to go to a real university, due to the experiences and social opportunities I missed out on.

I think during college I kept telling myself that I didn’t need friends or a girlfriend, since I was raised fairly well off and thought money would make me happy. I did not make much of an effort to befriend people and socialise, though I did make about three friends (mostly because of their effort) and talk to a few acquaintances occasionally in classes. Therefore, when it came time to leave, I thought I could manage perfectly fine on my own and in isolation. For the first 2 years or so, I think I managed to get by without any huge breakdowns, though I was never particularly happy, as I was also working part time in a butchery that I actually quite enjoyed and earned a decent amount of money. Though there was always something lingering in the back of my mind that I was alone and unhappy, whenever I would go out into town and see people my age with their friends or partners I would feel envious but tried to ignore it. I joined the gym in 2016 to try to build confidence (also to look better, get stronger, etc), though it doesn’t seem to have helped significantly in that area.

Anyway, in April 2017 the butchery I worked in closed down and I was moved over to the general store side of the shop, with all the other people I knew in the butchery leaving to work elsewhere. I hated working on the other side, and I generally spent 8 hours a day in a small room on my own in the ‘bakery’, eventually leaving in November. However, the main turning point was about half a year ago when I was driving in town and saw one of my old friends from college, who went to university and don’t speak to anymore. I couldn’t speak to them since I was driving, though it made me realise that two years had passed by and I had been doing nothing but studying and working entirely on my own, when everyone else had moved on, made friends, and was enjoying life. Since then I have been more depressed than usual, I added my other 2 old friends on Facebook though it feels like they might just tell me to fuck off if I try and talk to them after 2 years of nothing.

In addition to this, I also developed some physical health issues in September/October, which have made day-to-day quite hard, though after a recent hospital appointment I am hopeful they should clear up. My parents also decided to live separately in October so I moved into a smaller house, though they are going on holiday together in March so fuck knows what’s going to happen there. I have always had suicide at the back of my mind if I get older and make little progress in life or become a failure since I live quite close to a railway, though I don’t think I’ll ever go through with that unless something extreme happens. I am considering going to my GP about my mental health though whether or not they’ll be interested I don’t know, when I’ve been going for other issues they didn’t seem to care much.

At this point, I really don’t know how to go about meeting people or making friends, since my degree is entirely online and I haven’t properly socialised in over 2 years or made friends outside of college. I am hoping that I will be able to a master’s degree afterwards, in which case I would certainly go to a real university and live in halls or something. I am aware I need to make significant effort myself, get out of my comfort zone, and not just expect people to like me. I am by no means attractive which may or may not have made things worse but I am normal weight and height. I would love any suggestions as to how I could go about trying to better myself or meet new people, since it seems quite apparent to me that I need to change myself fundamentally.

I can't really make a **tl;dr** but if you like just ignore the middle bits really.

Thank you.

**EDIT:** I am extremely grateful for all the replies and advice everyone has given to me, I have been reading all of them and I feel more confident now in doing things I wouldn't have before.

So whenever she came in, the staff on the cigarette counter (by the front entrance) would do a tanoy staff announcement ""service 43"" which would be to tell a staff member (who would stop whatever they're doing) to sneakily keep an eye on her (pretend to face up nearby the bread rolls). It went on for a good couple of years (and occasionally she'd still do take bread bites when she came into the store unnoticed, often because new staff didn't know what she looked like) until she just stopped coming in any more (I assume, but don't know for sure, that she died).

Two of the pools had those dedicated swim lanes with no-one in them, so I can't see why he would want to stay in the main bit aside for the fact it gave him a chance to huff and puff about less able swimmers.

1) No hate means:

a) do not be gratuitously rude or unpleasant to other redditors.

b) do not make offensive jokes at the expense of other countries and cultures. There is often a fine line between comic national stereotypes and offensive ones. We now have many foreign subscribers, and everyone should be welcome here.

2) No politics means not making comments that could turn into political discussions or even alluding to politics. This rule is for the good of everyone.

Please do not try and bend or test these rules. It should be obvious to everyone what is rude and what is political. For example, a comic picture of a politician is absolutely NOT allowed on the specious argument it is a joke.

7v7fhs,Wifi or wife.,"Sunday looking at wifi forums. Changed one letter.

Why does my wife suddenly stop working?

My camera lost my wife.

How do I get wife in my shed?

Can I get wife in my house without cable?

How do I stop my neighbour accessing my wife?

Why is my wife only working well after 11?

Between 6 – 8 my wife always drops out.

Better wife than previous generation.

Virgin wife is not super at all.

Lost all wife connection for 20 minutes a couple of times a day.

Seems a nice quality product however it won't connect. At first I thought it was virgin. All you have to do is press the two buttons. Alas this didn't work so my brother-in-law, who is an expert, came over but despite 2 hours of trying the two will not speak to each other. 

Have had this wife for nearly 8 months now in converted garage. It works very sporadically and not efficiently enough to do anything properly - have given up on it! 

Thought it would fix wife connection problems but at my age (71) could not resolve connection problems.

Wife stopped working after a couple of months of minimal usage. Is there a way I can get replacement? Worked perfect before it suddenly refused to connect.

I bought this to upgrade my wife after installing a mesh system. 

The wife typically stops working after about 10 minutes, sometimes less, sometimes more. The only way to get wife to work again is to unplug it and plug it in again. When I unplug it I can notice it is quite hot, perhaps that is why it stops working. I don't know but it is unusable and unacceptable.

Wife comes with a complicated program which you need to use to get it to work.

Terrible. It overheats and completely lags out. Don't buy if you expect to use your wife for long periods of time.

Was a very tight squeeze to insert into the port, then when I tried to pull it out the end stayed in the wife and the main bit came away. I then had to use tweezers to get the end out. Very poor quality, obviously not made to strict specifications. 

Really disappointing after choosing because of the large amount of 5*' reviews this wife has. 

When I tried to fit it into my wife it didn't fit and I needed to jiggle it a fair bit to get it to go in. I tried 2 ports to get it in. It didn't seem to do anything, although it was recognised. Then I tried to remove it and it was quite firmly jammed. Heart in mouth I had to manoeuvre it backwards and forwards until it finally started to release but was terrified it would demolish the port. The best part of the purchase was the rapid refund after I posted it back. 

Needlessly complicated to set up and if you don't speak 'nerd' or have much wife experience you'll have no chance to get it to work! 

Struggled to pick up wife in a 2 bedroom flat so I'm really not impressed, however it does work 

Initially, this item appeared to tick all of the boxes. It's at a great price point and was an ideal to get wife access to an upstairs study. The wife is strong, and in line with what I would expect to see from downstairs.

Unfortunately, for online gaming, it causes huge problems as wife will drop you from the server as soon as it happens. It's very frustrating to get dropped from a lobby as soon as you enter because of your wife.

Quite problematic, wife goes off at random times and I have to restore the connection. There is no way to disable the wife's sleep feature. Tech support of this product unable to provide a solution. 

When the wife was moved upstairs to a bedroom, the ping increased and the transfer rate dropped. Tried a couple of different sockets without success.

We purchased it because the wife is weak upstairs and limiting. The house is a new build so I don't think our wiring is the problem. 

I bought this to try and improve the wife in the attic, but it's very slow and is no better than the wife in the bedroom just below. I tried it in various locations around the house, and while it did work in every room, no matter where we were it was the same speed or slower than the wife in every place.
It may be useful in places where there is no wife, but if there is I wouldn't bother with this. 

I can get my wife almost all the way to the garage but still can't get wife in the bedroom which is bizarre.

7ttcdy,I just got back from meeting with a wedding caterer and it was like I was Gordon Ramsey on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.,"My wedding is in 40 days and we still don't have a cake or caterer. We have everything else. No big deal.

I Googled last week for best caterers in my area of the South of England. This catering company popped up with a lot of 4.5/5 reviews. My Fiance is on a business trip up North so me and my MIL went to meet this catering guy.

He does have his own catering site, but on weekdays he works at a construction site near a military base serving food. He charges 4.50 for beans on toast there. Literally two slices of toast with beans.

We told him what we wanted and somehow during the conversation of desserts he mentioned that the mini cake slices come individually wrapped. Sounded like some cheap thing you get at a petrol station. He also argued his food was homemade, but didn't shy away from the fact that his food was just Iceland stuff put together. 

If it's from fucking Iceland then it's not homemade, mate. 

I swear he just bought his reviews to make himself/business look good. 

Oh, and also he has an on-site cooking place, but wants to meet everyone inside our own house to sample the food because we can't go to his for some reason. Did I mention he wrote notes down on an old piece of food wrapper?

Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him? I swear I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.

I'm going to go to Iceland now and buy frozen sausage rolls and lasagna and start calling myself a proper chef and caterer. I'd make a shit ton. I mean this guy charges a grand for 40 people.

He had been lighting incense in the car, and burnt the seat AND his cat may have ""had a water accident"" in there leaving a smell. 

This guy must have been hotboxing that car every night of the week. It doesn't smell like a sea of ganja anymore, and I explained it might have smelled like that from being a little damp while it sat.

7s76h2,"To the person who stole my birthday present, Thank You!","So my gran called me a few days after my birthday to ask me why I didn't call her on my birthday to say thank you for my parcel. I didn't get a parcel,I explained, much to her disappointment. I called up my aunty to get the tracking number and after a few minutes on hold the lady at the courier company was able to read me a near perfect description of my designated safe place so I know the courier had definitely been there delivering the parcel. We looked all over the garden, just in case the parcel had grown legs and crawled away but eventually had to accept that it'd probably been pinched. Same thing happened a few months ago with another parcel but that one was literally full of little rocks for the aquarium. We had a good laugh at the idea of this thief carrying home a 10kg parcel only to open it and find about £8 of gravel but we weren't so pleased by the idea of someone enjoying my birthday present. 

After satisfying myself the parcel was not submerged in the pond or buried in the rockery I called my aunty back and explained what happened. I asked her to tell me what was inside so I could pretend and thank my gran. She told me it contained;
a) a nice card 
b) some low fat low sugar biscuits that were on sale
c) some pictures of my dead father.

I said in a half joking way thanks for reminding me that my father is dead. She replied ""they are not pictures of your father who died they are pictures of your dead father, in the hospital, after they switched him off!"". 

So, to you, dear neighborhood vagabond, I hope you enjoy the pictures of what I can only imagine is my father's mutilated corpse shortly after he died from wounds sustained in a terrible car crash in 1989. I also hope those nasty old lady biscuits my nan thinks I like because I'm fat and should want to loose weight keep you company while you enjoy the nice card.

7s5jz8,Sub updates.,"Hello! We have seen some rumblings in the sub about the direction in which we're heading towards as we gain size and popularity. Namely that the content is getting watered down. As mods we generally remove comments that break our 'no politics' and 'no shit throwing' rules but leave posts alone so long as they don't break these. 
 
As a result of what we consider to be low touch moderating, we end up with a lot of posts that would be better suited to /r/BritishProblems, namely ""there are easter eggs in January!"" or ""I'm scared of public interaction"", ""this shop messed up the price of a thing"" and so on. 
 
Going forward we have decided that we will begin removing the more low effort posts and redirecting the traffic towards /r/BritishProblems, /r/AskUK, /r/UnitedKingdom and so on. We are going to work on updating the rules but for the time being we ask that you trust our judgement and we will always inform the OP as to why we are removing their post. 
 
We want to encourage more OC, whether it's a good anecdote, a unique picture, an interesting questions, a weird news story etc. and as always we're open to new daily thread suggestions that we can sticky for the day. 
 
I hope that the majority are in agreement but please do let us know your thoughts on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7s5jz8/sub_updates/,1516625682.0,261,0.99,142,CasualUK,[deleted]

We had a crap experience with a TV licence knobhead who came to the door and shouted at us despite us having a licence many moons ago and this is my way of 'paying it back'.

There's still a lot of STDs out there, and some will fuck you up properly if you don't get treated, so it's worth just getting it done and out the way. Even if you've not done the horizontal line dance for a bit, there's still a chance you could have not shown symptoms for a while, so it's worth it just for the peace of mind.

Unfortunately, I was hit with an incurable physical condition which has gotten significantly worse in the past two years. (If you're interested I can PM you the details).

Consequently, I've been unable to leave the house and do simple everyday things I used to enjoy. All of my friends either work or study away and I am incredibly lonely.

Wondering if anyone is willing to have a skype/voice call? Just for general chit chat. I enjoy sports, music, philosophy, taking the piss out of everything and dry humour.

I can send a pic of myself if you're unsure. Hope you all have a great evening.

There's a Mercedes Jeep on the roundabout with its hazards on...  ""what's this?""  - I think as I cant see any driver or any other cars.... 

Maybe its been stolen and abandoned.... then I clock him. 

Lazy middle aged cunt of a wank, on his way back to the car having stopped on a fucking roundabout to post a letter in the postbox.  A postbox that is not 50 yards from a side street where he could have quite easily parked.

He gives me a wave, I return his wave by mouthing ""what the fuck"" and a look of (hopefully) pure hatred.

7o25jm,"Essex, have you seen this dog? Danbury / Lingwood / Blakes Wood / Billericay / Little Baddow area. My friend is besides himself.","Hi guys,

[Kahn](http://www.doglost.co.uk/poster.php?dogId=120939#.Wk3_g9Jl8dU) has been missing since October. My friend is going mad trying to find him now. He hasn't worked a day since the dog went missing, spends his nights camped out looking for him. Spreads his scent over the woods, fields, has search parties, and we're still trying to find this beautiful Houdini of a creature. 

Latest sighting as been in the Danbury and Little Baddow area, and is very recent. 

Keep this in mind when you're out and about, maybe mention it to some friends - someone knows something.

7mtj8a,"If my husband doesn't get out of hospital in time, we'd like to give away our holiday ❄️","My partner was admitted to hospital last night and I highly doubt he's going to be out in time to take us all on our planned holiday. The company we booked with doesn't offer refunds under any circumstances so if we don't turn up then the place will just sit empty for four days and I'm not having that! 

So if you don't have any serious plans for New Years perhaps you'd like the option of spending four nights in a little cottage in Whitby. You'll most likely need your own car and I won't be able to confirm until tonight so you'll need to be flexible. The booking starts tomorrow the 30th and runs until 4th January. The place itself is small but big enough for two people sharing (or one on the couch), not wheelchair accessible, self catering, and has a log fire, private garden and is a few mins from the beach. 

I hope there's someone out there who is in a position to take advantage of this just in case they won't let my partner out in time or if he's too tired t o drive etc... Please leave me a comment below if you're interested and I'll be in touch to confirm.

7m2i4s,"If you are alone on Christmas and wanting a holiday cheer, look inside.","Merry Christmas to all.

Inspired by the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/7lzbk7/anyone_having_a_shit_christmas_and_could_use_some/) over at /r/australia I am doing a similar giveaway.

If you are home alone and having a shitty day, I hope a pizza, a curry or a Chinese might make it better.

I am doing a giveaway of 10 meals upto £10 each.  

The following are the rules of the giveaway, which has been blatantly ripped off from the other thread:

* Your Reddit account must be at least 90 days old with at least 400 comment karma, and your post history must show evidence of productive participation with Reddit in general
* No witch hunts or doxxing or intense scrutiny of participants; if someone scams a free meal it isn't the end of the world
* Please don't PM me, keep things confined to this thread
* **Just Eat** only. I repeat again **Just Eat** only. Go to [just-eat.co.uk](https://www.just-eat.co.uk), enter your postcode and check if there are any places open before you post. Pick a place and decide what you want to have for dinner. Please try and keep it within £10, though if it goes a bit (max +£3) above the limit it is fine.
* If you're making a request, create a top-level comment starting with the word ""REQUEST"" in bold (like this: **REQUEST**), followed by a blank line, then what food you're after and the fulfilment method (i.e, pickup or delivery), followed by another blank line, then whatever other context you want to provide. Don't overdo it, but don't underdo it either.
* If you're in a position to pick up, even if it's a little bit out of your way, please try and do that so.

I think that is everything,

7lwt2h,Instantly regretted drunk mistakes,"Thought I’d share this as this happened more or less a year ago.




So I’d been out on the piss as you do because it’s Christmas (wheyyeyeye lads lads lads). On the way home I stop off at a 24 hour Subway which is inside a Spar. Get a load of grub and 4 cans and then remortgage the house to pay for a taxi home. When it’s cold, I like to put my drinks on the window ledge to keep them nice and cold, so I line them up on there and start watching a film on my laptop. 



So, I’ve finished the first one and then get up to retrieve another. Outside my window there’s another sloping roof down to the conservatory roof, which isn’t flat it’s… roof shaped. Basically, I knock two off them off somehow and they slide down the roof landing in the gutter between the two roofs. Now when I was younger I’d often boot a football onto the roof and get it stuck in the same space. To get it back we’d just climb out the window and shuffle down the roof on our ass and shuffle back up. Easy I thought. Done in two minutes. So, I climb up on to the ledge and stick my feet out thinking ‘Don’t worry lads, no man left behind’. I’d like to point out I’m in only underwear as I’d been watching whatever film it was in bed. So, I commence my shuffle downwards.


Well who’d of thought on one the coldest nights of that winter so far, the roof was slippery and icy. I slide down this muddy slippery slope of regret and bad decisions on my arse in my pants. I land in a thud at the bottom. By some miracle I didn’t go straight through the conservatory roof. I remember thinking clear as a day ‘Ah shitttt, I’ve fucked up here.’ Obviously I try to climb back up. Slip back down. On my side. Slip back down. On my back. Slip back down. It aint happening. At this point, I’m no longer feeling pleasantly drunk. I’m feeling fucking cold and I’m bleeding. I shuffle over to the side of the roof and try and pull myself up the side. Slide straight back down. I keep trying this as it’s the most successful so far. At the top of this bit there’s another window in an unused room, so I’m hoping I can grab the ledge of that and pull myself to safety.  I got so close. So close. One more pull away, before I lost my grip and slid back down. I’m screwed. 

I estimate that I’ve been out here for at least an hour at this point. My brother came home for Christmas that night and his window is slightly open (he’s in the loft). So not wishing to alarm anyone other than him, I start to whistle. Gently louder and louder. Eventually he heard me.  Obviously, he asks the usual questions “What the fuck are you doing out there?” “How the fuck did you get out there?” “Have you got Dad’s Christmas present yet?”


He comes down to my window and throws me a line, pulling me to safety. Now in the light, I can see the damage. I’m covered head to toe in mud and years of roof slime. My chest, hands, legs and arms are shredded like I’ve just been put through a cheese grater. I retreat downstairs for a shower thanking my brother and reminding him not to tell Mum or Dad. For weeks after I was in constant pain from the numerous cuts. Merry fucking Christmas dumbass. 



So I’m sure we’ve all got good stories. Let’s hear ‘em and celebrate Christmas with regret and cringe.

We finished our game and he challenged us to a game of Snooker. My 2 mates didn't seem interested, ""oh, it's just some old guy"", but I was up for it. I thought ""fucking hell, 'some old guy' wanting a game of Snooker against me. He's got to be professional"",  I'd give him a game.

He took the break, and missed everything. I let him re-break, he missed everything.

That's when I knew.

He didn't want to play Snooker to beat ""some young whipper snapper"". He wanted to play Snooker for the interaction.

He had many, **many** stories about the war. He had many stories about where he was stationed, and about what he did. He seemed to have a **lot** of respect for the Queen, and how he ""fought for her"".

Anyway, he wasn't great at Snooker... like... at all... He missed very easy shots, and he was singing very old songs. But he fucking loved it.

I ""over calculated"" a shot or two and he was thrilled he won. But it **REALLY** hit home how's there's a lot of guys out there who gave life and limb for this country who don't have friends or family to spend Christmas with.

Maybe just ask how they are or how their day has been, maybe give them a hand with their shopping or ask them if they want taking anywhere. Without these guys we certainly wouldn't be where we are today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7lsvln/i_played_some_snooker_against_some_old_guy/,1514084731.0,625,0.99,35,CasualUK,lukejames1111

7kp0kq,Today I quit gambling after watching someone lose £2k,"So I had what I call a minor gambling problem. I've lost a few thousand this year but I never spent more than a few hundred in one go.

This isn't the most I've seen someone lose, not even close. I saw someone go from a small amount, not sure exactly, to almost £2k on the roulette. Then the guy was betting on black only, which is a 50/50 chance. I watched as red came in 21 times in a row and he lost all his money.

I was pretty fucking disgusted to be honest. I realised I hated the gambling industry more than anything at that moment. It felt like everybody around was feeling the same thing.

Fuck gambling. It's too much of a cliche to say ""the house always wins"".

I know someone will say you should know when to stop. Anyone that gambles knows that's not how it works. When should he have stopped? £50? £500? £1000? He would have never got to £2k if he stopped.

As a minor gambling addict I think my urge to gamble was already killed a month ago when someone I knew (who works a minimum wage job) won £6k and he didn't even seem bothered or happy about it. This was just the nail in the coffin.

as I'm here to tell  
putrid and vile  
and that's just the smell

&amp;nbsp;

Step past broken bottles  
and over dead seagulls,  
past littered cheap beer cans  
and junkies old needles

&amp;nbsp;

Past faded signs sighing  
""cheap rooms to let""  
past a pregnant teen smoking  
a menthol cigrette

&amp;nbsp;

Through canyons of brutalist  
Seventies concrete  
there's booze shops and bookmakers  
every 12 feet

&amp;nbsp;

Dead eyed people at slot machines  
stand at their posts  
the whole town feels haunted  
and we're all the ghosts

&amp;nbsp;

Even the air itself  
feels greasy and sticky  
avert eyes from the bins  
where a pair have a quickie

&amp;nbsp;

There's plastic castle spires  
in damn aquamarine  
from a heyday long past  
all stained algea green

&amp;nbsp;

Walk past bad graffiti  
""Gazza waz here!""  
take a tentative walk  
on the mouldering pier

7ji94h,Why are builders so notoriously untrustworthy?,"I'm a working class sprat, my uncle Pete is a carpet layer, uncle Mick is a mechanic, cousin Paul is a commercial re-fitter, etc... Growing up I've always known these guys to be salt of the earth type fellas, kind, loving, premium banter. 

At the grand age of 31 I hired my first builders to do a full renovation of a small one bed apartment. I've been nice to them from the start, honest, always paid my installments on time, I always say please and thank you, never barking orders or treating them like 'workmen'. 

Despite this, it seems they've gone out of their way to be as deceptive, slippery, and non-committal as possible. When I try and be frank with them they retreat. When I try and give them a little sugar they take advantage of me. 

I think what's happening is that they're palming off old stock onto me at padded prices. Honestly, I wouldn't mind that much if I was getting what I wanted but I've ended up with the most horrendous cacophony of beige and grey. 

So my question is this; why are tradesmen so notoriously dishonest? Literally everyone I've asked for advice has replied with their own horror story about builders. 

My second question is does anyone have any advice on managing the relationship with slippery tradesmen or some on advice on picking a good one? 

As soon as these builders are out of the door (in 18 days God willing) I'm going to have to hire some new guys to fix all the beige but I have lost confidence in myself and my ability to wrangle these guys. Every week the property stands unfinished I'm bleeding money so I can't afford more disasters.

Edit: I want to thank everyone here for the comments, I've been in bits today and it really helped to vent. I've found out, after talking to his ""solicitor"" that he's a member of an extremely dodgy religious cult and idk why but it just cemented everything I had figured out about this guy. I informed the ""solicitor"" I wanted them out by the end of the day.

About an hour later a big tow truck pulls up outside the house, bit strange but whatever. Next thing the bloke gets out the truck with a bag and knocks on the door. The delivery driver has broken down and sent the truck to drop it off.

The truck driver wasnt qualified in this department so I actually got someone elses order aswell, so on top of my usual order I got

Chicken burger
Chips x2
Popadoms x4 
Dips for poppadoms
Tandori chicken from the bone
Peri peri chicken starter
2x Dr Pepper cans

The driver rang me about half an hour later so thought i'd been rumbled. He just wanted to ask if the food was okay and sorry for being late.

When I was a nipper I used to be into it (Thomas the Tank, Bluebell Railway, etc.) and once or twice in my darker teenage years. It was the butt of many jokes in the 80's and 90's, but now it just seems oddly quaint and of a bygone era.

The idea of making a plastic airfix kit in my workshop with a cup of tea and an audiobook going in the background seems like it would be a fine alternative to playing computer games, or watching TV.

I'm not looking for approval (obviously) but wanted to tap into the zeitgeist to see what other people's thoughts are.

7hwxuu,Anyone here adopted?,"After a fantastic episode of I'm a Celebrity, I watched a show called 'Finding Me A Family' and it was about the 2,000 children currently in care, waiting to be picked by a family, sort of like how you would pick a dog in a rescue center. 
 
I myself had to go through this unusual process when I was a nipper, with my siblings. As there were four of us at the time, no family wanted to take four potentially problematic kids home with them. They were quite unruly children, bags of energy, racing around like greyhounds and were subsequently snapped up by various families, and I haven't seen / heard from any of them ever since and vice versa. I, unfortunately, suffered the brunt of the physical abuse from my Mother's then boyfriend who was a drug dealer and a drunk, which made me terrified of adults. Whenever anyone tried to come and have a chat, I would run away and hide. Thankfully this lovely pair (Mum &amp; Dad) decided to take the broken kid home with them (even if I spent a good few weeks hiding under my new bed) and thankfully I haven't turned out too unusual (I think). 
 
It's not really something I bring up unless specifically asked about my family, so I wanted to ask the question to see if anyone else here is adopted and if they would be willing to share their story, either in this thread or PM or whatever. 
 
It was a really fantastic show that Channel 4 did there. fully recommend it.

7hgohi,So what’s the deal with kids now running out in front of traffic on purpose?,"Not sure if this is UK wide or just in the area I live, but recently I’ve had 3 or 4 near misses with young teens/kids running out in front of my vehicle on purpose, making you slam your brakes on.  Only reason I didn’t hit the last kid was because he kept running in the same direction as my car (so he ran out in front of my car and then kept running down the road following the lane of traffic!).  If he’d tripped he would have went under the front bumper for sure.  Also, as a side note, even the ones who aren’t doing it on purpose just kind of meander as slowly as possibly once they realise you’re there, staring at you the whole time in some kind of weird defiance.

Any teens on here that can offer an explanation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7hgohi/so_whats_the_deal_with_kids_now_running_out_in/,1512385990.0,106,0.99,95,CasualUK,[deleted]

7hggy5,'Tis the season!,"I'll be having my 4th Christmas party since I left Uni, and it's at my 3rd place of work. So far I have experienced a wide yet incredibly similar range of Christmas activities, office to office. 
 
_________________________________________________ 
 
**The Christmas Counter** 
 
What's the time Debbie? ""It's 21 days until Christmas!"" comes the reply. Debbie has been doing this since mid-August and her desk resembles Santa's grotto. If she's not singing ""deck the halls"", she's offering out gingerbread like it was Hansel and Gretel's wet dream. 
 
*Debbie is usually single and lives with seven cats, all named after reindeer. Occasionally you hear her sobbing in the bathroom*.  
 
__________________________________________________
 
**The Christmas Jumper** 
 
It's time to prove once and for all that you are the most outgoing and fun person in the office. ""Yippee!"" you cry, as you don the most garish and obtuse knitwear you can find. You can't let sue outshine you again with her reindeer jumper that sung ""Jingle Bells"" in Stephen Hawking's voice every time you walked past her.  
 
*You usually stop to coo over the little baby elf outfits and look forward to having a little chunk you can dress up like a twat at Christmas in the future*. 
 
__________________________________________________
 
**Secret Santa** 
 
The budgets have been set at a modest £10 but you've unfortunately drawn the forty year old married lady whom you've spoken to once or twice in the past six months. What to get her... Do you try and be funny, get her a massive vibrator? No, you don't know if she's getting none at home, might be an insensitive gift that ends with a trip to HR... Do you get actual nice things like a book and candle? But what if everyone else gets funny presents and mine is all proper... I guess it doesn't really matter, no one will know it's me. I'll get her a vibrator and a candle. Done. 
 
__________________________________________________
 
**The Christmas Meal** 
 
The bossy one in your team has picked the venue and it's a slightly upmarket carvery, where poor, fat, white people go to gorge on low quality cuts of meat soaked in runny gravy. Despite pretending to love Christmas dinner, you quietly acknowledge that it's the worst of Sunday roasts. Turkey is sub-par and if you wanted a dry old bird you would have been a bit more flirty with Doris when you helped her cross the road. 
 
The boss wants to prove that he isn't a cheapskate but fails to do so by ordering a single bottle of ""sparkling grape wine"" and sharing a thimble out among the team before making it all about him in his grand speech about what a wonderful work place it is. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**The Christmas Party** 
 
The tunes are on, the DJ looks alarmingly like the cleaner and everyone has squeezed their flabby old bodies into clothes that haven't fit them since they were teenagers. Time to make awkward small talk until you're drunk enough to tell Sue that her laugh makes you want to scratch your eyes out but you'd still sling one up her regardless.

What is it about winter time where dog walkers (I know not all of you do it but apparently enough of you do) think ""Nah its too cold, I don't need any baggies, it'll freeze before anyone steps in it"". I've trod in it twice today alone and had a few near misses too. I've seen kids having a stone/snow ball fight pick up a fresh'un and hit another kid in the chest with it (It was like watching the german version of Bullseye but part way in someone shouts ""WHAT THE FUCK, DAN, THATS FUCKING DISGUSTING!"").

7f9bcn,Americans have this awful edited version of Takeshi's Castle with two dreadful hosts (rather than the glorious Craig Charles) and they even dub over the contestants...It's edited so that it's two teams against each other rather than a load of people vs. Takeshi. Absolute rubbish.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlvGc8wXr2A&amp;feature=youtu.be

Here's a video showing the crap hosts and the useless dubbing of contestants.

Apparently in America it's called *Most Extreme Elimination Challenge* 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Extreme_Elimination_Challenge

&gt;It is a re-purpose of footage from the Japanese game show Takeshi's Castle which originally aired in Japan from 1986 to 1990 and starred ""Beat"" Takeshi, a very popular and ""hip"" Japanese entertainer. The re-purposed ""MXC"" created a completely new premise, storyline and characters. **The original '""Takeshi's Castle"" started with a glob of about 40 contestants competing against each other in challenges for the honor of being the five finalists who would attempt to storm the castle and defeat the powerful Count Takeshi and his crew of underlings. The MXC re-purpose created two teams competing against each other à la a typical Saturday afternoon network football game broadcast, with players trying to win points for their teams by surviving through different challenges. In the original program the Count and his underlings would follow the progress of the players as they moved through the course. In the re-purpose Count Takeshi became veteran network announcer Vic Romano and the count's flunky became young upstart Kenny Blankenship.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/7f9bcn/americans_have_this_awful_edited_version_of/,1511548076.0,101,0.96,21,CasualUK,urYLwDclzGgJYD0yNeTk

7ehgnf,The /r/CasualUK Census.,"Hi all, 

Since our inception in February 2017, we have picked up 55,000 subscribers sharing their photos, stories and just generally chewing the fat with us throughout the day. It's been a brilliant sub and we are all immensely proud of the community spirit that you have all developed. 

We thought it would be fun to run a census to better understand who is subscribed and contributing to the subreddit. It is completely anonymous but please don't feel obligated to take part. 

We will keep this thread around for a week or so and then we can publish some nifty graphs as we enter December (in time for our Christmas themed daily threads!)

As I'm sure you all have noticed, we've partnered up with some volunteers who are transcribing the images that pop up in our sub. They're doing this as part of a project to make reddit more accessible for everyone, including blind and/or dyslexic users (and even people that have issues because of slow internet or limited data). 

This is something that the mod team has agreed to in partnership with /r/TranscribersOfReddit, so please be welcoming to them, but feel free to help them make corrections if a pop culture reference is missed! They are all open to feedback :) 

If you have any questions about the project, go check them out at https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index, or message their moderators, and they will be happy to answer any questions you may have. 

Please do not report these comments as spam, since this is part of a larger project working towards greater Reddit accessibility.

7d4gyy,"Am I, as a childless, adult man, expected to use the Lollypop Lady to cross the road?","This morning I was leaving later than usual, just around 9am. As someone who lives very near a primary school, there's a lollypop lady who sits at a crossing which is part of my walk to the bus stop. Normally I don't see her because I leave earlier, but I remember her from when I went to primary school because it's the same woman. I'm assuming she was just getting ready to leave, because at this time the primary school bell had rang and the children were all in the playground and going inside. So I'm walking up to this crossing, obviously checking for cars, and I determine it's clear so I go to step out on the road. Just as I do that I hear the woman say ""hold on!"". She gets up off the chair she's sitting on and does her whole thing, standing in the middle of the road with the big stick. I cross the road and awkwardly thank her, because I'm an awkward person.


Is this normal? Am I crazy for assuming that she only does that for children and parents with children? I'm obviously not annoyed or anything, just a little surprised. Do I look like a primary school child maybe?

""Amy"" will then release the ""Comms Cabinet Key"".

You must now locate ""The Meter Cupboard"" if you have found a label on a discarded master socket cover in ""The Comms Room"".

""The Meter Cupboard"" is located behind a barred and locked gate and is then itself locked.

To gain access through the Barred Gate you must seek ""Simon Blyth"". Using your powers of deduction you will find that he is not a human but a corporate entity, an ""Estate Agent"". Approaching him/her you must show deference, but no ID. You will learn that the key to the ""Meter Cupboard"" is hidden in the paper drawer of a laser printer and incorrectly labelled.

""Simon Blyth"" will not be able to help you to access the Barred Gate. For this you must quest further to find an immaculately coiffured and three-piece-suited gentleman in a financial advisors. 

Address him correctly and he will leave his office by the rear entrance to the tunnel of escape and reappear at the now magically opened Barred Door to the Tunnel of Escape.

7aaoyr,Clarification on the rules,"Hi squad, 
 
Receiving a lot of reports from people who are unhappy with inconsistent moderation so I'd like to take the time to reiterate and clarify the rules and act as a punching bag if you have any grievances so that I can liaise with the rest of the team.  
 
I will be working on some proper rhetoric now that we're a 'proper sub'. When /u/GazzaKnight and I made this sub as a bit of a joke, we laughed about trying to get 10,000 subs by Christmas. It looks like we'll probably smash 65k at current rates so the sidebar does need updating. It genuinely has not been touched since day 1 as we felt it was part of the charm.
 
__________________________________________________ 
-  No Politics. 
 
Does what it says on the tin. If you're thinking about posting a clever quip about the Government like you're Ian Hislop or something, give it a miss. 
 
Some people have tried to argue that everything in the world is linked to politics and that this should therefore be a blank sub... just use your common sense and report it if it looks too close to the mark. We can investigate and discuss internally. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
- No shit throwing 
 
This rule seems to be getting a little blurred at the moment. Calling southern people posh pansies, or northern people cavemen is not shit throwing. These are lazy stereotypes that we have all grown up with and we have surely all had a chuckle about. 
 
Launching a tirade of abuse at a fellow user is shit throwing. If you are calling someone ""a fucking cunt"" then you are in breach of the rule. If you are being unnecessary combative you are also in breach of the rule. Tone it down and call them a ~~slappywag~~ helmet or something. 
 
I think this sub has a clear community to it, a clear tone of address. It's pub talk and we're all a load of mates. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
- Nothing nice to say, don't say it. 
 
Another blurred rule that I, if I can get round to it today, will work on some wording to rectify. 
 
If a user poses a question that asks ""what is your favourite British film?"" and you reply ""I hate films!"" then you are not contributing to the thread in any way, shape or form. The question clearly wasn't meant for you and we will remove any comments of that ilk. 
 
if the question is ""do you like British films?"" then feel free to post your thoughts. It's just about using some common sense, reading the question, not pissing on bonfires for the sake of it and try to be supportive, encouraging etc.  
 
This is a good place for good people and we want to keep it that way. 
 
As always, please report comments/posts that you feel don't contribute in a positive manner and if you want to slag me or the mod team off in a report comment... Maybe grow the stones to do it in the modmail and we can chat with you about it there and then.

dpldv5,I’ve finally found a CBD oil that works and I’m so happy I want to tell everybody!,"Before I get into this I just want to say that no, I’m not in any way related or sponsored by any CBD brand. Most of the brands out there are a complete scam. The majority of testimonials that have become viral on social media are either faked or dubious to say the least. Please feel free check out my post history. I’m just a simple designer from the UK, I’m in no way an “influencer” or a PR marketer trying to pull a fast one. Anyway…

I suffer from Anxiety, and when I say suffer, I mean suffer! I have the type of anxiety that’s so bad that if I attempt to have a conversation with someone new, I will shake and stutter. If my husband politely asks me to hurry up or tries to surprise me, I will have a full blown anxiety attack. It has been an absolute burden on my life and has prevented me from wanting to socialise in public. It effects my work as I constantly “shiver” and we even decided to elope to get married so that I wouldn’t have an attack walking down the aisle.

I first heard about CBD from a friend. They sent me one of the many viral videos and I was intrigued. It's pretty easy to get CBD oil these days, so I purchased a bottle online to try.

Honestly I saw no difference. This particular brand recommended that I take a few of their peppermint drops under my tongue, 3 times a day. I did this for 2 weeks and saw no change. I would still shake and stutter. I felt conned.

A few months later my husband saw CBD oil at our local Boots and decided that if Boots where stocking it, it must be a more legitimate product…

NOPE!

These new drops where orange flavoured and had the exact same effect. That being none. Although they looked a lot fancier! So like most people I just threw the bottle away and decided to never bother with CBD oil again. Luckily my wonderful husband doesn’t give up so easy and he started researching into CBD oil and the differences each give.

To put it as “Explain Like I’m Five” as I can…

There are 3 types of CBD oil. These are: Isolate, Broad Spectrum and Full Spectrum.

Now legally in the UK you can only sell CBD oil if that oil has less than 0.3% THC. THC is the psychoactive substance that makes you high in cannabis, but at these levels it doesn’t. To play it safe, stores like Boots and Holland and Barrett, will only sell Isolate and Broad Spectrum CBD oils. Both of these types of CBD have been stripped (purified) fully of there THC values. Unfortunately during the purification process, these oils lose a ton of the other “good stuff” that actually helps to make the product work.

So with this in mind, my husband was now looking for CBD oil that was marked as “Full Spectrum”. This means that all of the goodness is kept in, and nothing is diluted away with unnecessary things like flavouring!

…Unfortunately, finding Full Spectrum CBD oil in shops is like finding hens teeth!

Roll on to a few weeks ago. My sister has recently started selling at the local artisan markets and to show our support we decided to attend.

Her stall was right next to a man claiming to sell “Handmade Artisan CBD oil”, which obviously peeked my husbands interest...

The gentleman on the stall was really helpful. He confirmed that most CBD oils on the market where not what they say  they are, and where in-fact diluted down so that their CBD percentage was a lot lower than what they claimed it to be. Plus the fact that isolate and broad spectrum is only really good for pet consumption and with the CBD market not yet regulated, CBD companies are getting away with flogging you products that have been proven not to work. (CBD water and CBD bath salts for example).

Honestly at this point I was done with CBD oil and pretty much refused to take it. It didn’t work for me and I didn’t see the point. My husband bought some regardless.

Out of curiosity my husband started taking it to help him sleep and my god it worked! After a few nights of listening to him snore I decided I would give it a try.

The first thing I noticed was the taste. The proper stuff tastes like cut grass! Once I had gotten over that I realised that I had stopped shivering. AFTER JUST 15 MINUTES! This effect lasted over 5 hours in total, but even after the event my hands where noticeably sturdier than they typically are.

Since that day I can not express just how much this has changed my life for the positive. Possibly the best example would be last week, when my husband and I travelled to india to attend the wedding of a friend. This was a huge event for me as 1. I have never travelled abroad before and 2. I have never attended a Hindu wedding. I took my CBD oil daily whist I was over there and I didn’t have a single anxiety attack. Not on the plane, not in a new country, not at the wedding, nothing. We are now planning more trips abroad and a possibly even a second wedding!

I've found that I don't need to take it every day as suggested, but I do have some days that are more stressful than others, which is when I chose to take it.

Apart from the anxiety its really helped with a stiffness I get in my neck. Sometimes my neck just never wants to turn. I've realised that this is no longer an issue for me. Also my sleeping patterns are amazing. I would often stay awake at night worrying about stupid things. Now however, I feel calm. It doesn't make you tired, you just feel really relaxed.

Anyway I hope this helps someone... I'm off to plan a wedding!

So we both put money in our meters, which supplies the right house, but we double the money. I put £10 in, she get £10 pound on her account. She puts £10 in I get £10 on my account. We're both on pre-pay meters so the money doesn't actually supply our houses but it's just sitting on our accounts.

Lady upstairs realised what was going on, cashed out gave me half the cash and changed suppliers on everything. Sweet £500 pay day and now I'm only paying my account.

Anyway, he's always been a charitable fellow so  he's been raising awareness about people with disabilities in Auz, which has ended up with him and some mates being the first people to cycle from the lowest part of Auz to the highest. 2100km in 42 days.  

""Walter Van Praag has 38% lung function (due to Cystic Fibrosis),  Daniel Kojta who is paraplegic and uses a hand-cycle, Paul Pritchard with half a working body (Hemiplegia). Paul will ride a tandem recumbent trike with Duncan Meerding, who is legally blind, thereby being his eyes. Conrad will be battling nerve pain from a damaged spine.""

77kxg5,Define UK upper middle class,"This came from a big 'ask reddit' thread but there were no answers from UK and no one seems to have a fucking clue what a 'gilet' or 'brogue' is (the brass of our former colonies eh!). The following is the definition I gave of upper middle class in my area. What about you?

Here in UK.

Detached rural or semi-rural Georgian house with 5 acres of pony land, small slightly tatty menage and a set of garages (not linked to the property). Garages contain a ride on mower, small quadbike and various Sthil petrol powered stuff for your holding. 3-year-old Audi estate for her, usually S line but still diesel and whatever fancypants german repmobile for him, a new Ifor Williams horsebox tucked away somewhere too. 2 kids both attending the local grammar school or, failing that, a not too far away non nationally renowned boarding school. The Little girl will be head to toe riding gear, mainly branded joules and hunter and boy will be in 'posh' catalogue order stuff for kids from places like jack wills, fat face and the odd bit of shooting/countryside stuff his mum picked him up at the county/local agri or pony show. Dad wears a pair of brogues most of the time with chinos, chequer shirt and Scholl gilet but at weekends/pony events will slip on a pair of Chameau wellies and a top end barbour jacket to look the part. Mum is usually in a pair of immaculate uggs, tight-fitting denim jeans and some kind of nice jumper with a joules or barbour gilet over the top. He likes playing golf and also is into road cycling (NOT MTB), she spends most of her time organising fundraising events and galas hiring out barns, organising balls and doing hospitality type/corporate days at the races and doing some kind of funrun training between yoga classes that her PT recommended.

They won't own a boat but will have access to one if needs be. Skiing is feb half term and 2 weeks in the south of france is the summer staple. City breaks happen through the year whilst the grandparents come over to look after the kids and Labradors. Every summer they will also get the key to a holiday home somewhere in the UK from a friend, no charge. If the kids are teenage chances are they will take a friend on holiday with them or they will go away with another friends parents, again no money for this will change hands.
Most of their friends will own or be high up in companies with 20 to 50 employees doing things like shipping, agricultural sales, estate agency, commercial supply in something dull etc. Their more distant friends will be doctors, solicitors or architects - all handy to know and they always get an invite to various marquee events you host through the year at your home.

Waitrose delivery yes, Sainsburys at a push but definitely nothing lower than tesco and only then if prosecco is on offer near christmas.

775d0h,Polish Shop Tips,"Edit: [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/77698s/polish_shop_tips_part_2/)

Since they're bloody everywhere now and I'm dragged into one at least once a week as my wife is Polish, here's the lowdown on what is worth stopping in for:

[Pierogi](http://www.leclerc.rzeszow.pl/foto_shop/137/brand_3074_1.jpg)

These are dumplings, like large ravioli - stick them in simmering water for a few minutes and then throw butter at them. The cheese and potato ones will be devoured by kids especially if you put chopped bacon on top. Meat and cabbage/mushroom aren't half bad either. If you like 'em crispy, just shallow fry for a few mins.

[Krokiety](https://www.papu24.pl/environment/cache/images/0_0_productGfx_cc63624f971072921a793c21549e2d5a.jpg)

Findus Crispy Pancakes on steroids. Cheap as hell and fine munchies. Shallow fry for a few mins. Generally the same fillings as the pierogi.

[Smoked fish](http://www.seamor.com.pl/wp-content/themes/seamor/banery/baner3.jpg)

Cheap and quite healthy - good for salads and breakfast. Often loose in boxes - just bag it up and take it to the till. 

[Meat counter](http://www.cardiffdirectory.wales/wp-content/uploads/formidable/12744294_981047661964083_2745640287325965207_n-1.jpg)

The main reason for going in a polski sklep - The meat is often much cheaper than the supermarkets and much better quality. 90% of what you see is pork and there are no hidden surprises in there - anything else will be chicken. Highlights are the smoked hams, smoked chicken legs and the awesome black pudding (kaszanka - pron. ,kash'anka). If you are having a BBQ, a polish shop meat counter should be your first port of call for grilling sausages.

[Nut Vodka](http://webtrunki.pl/pics/trunki_photo/7/trunek_7435_org.jpg)

Ever got pissed on liquid KitKats? now's your chance - this stuff is incredible - as with any vodka that's going to be drunk neat, stick in the freezer first.

[Pickled Cucumbers](https://img.e-piotripawel.pl/photos/h5d/5903386022374.jpg)

The Poles have got this one sewn up - nobody does gherkins better.  2 types here - the familiar vinegar pickles (ogorki korniszony) and the brined pickles (ogorki kiszone) which ferment and leave the middle of the gherkin fizzy - weird and wonderful.

If you can get past the occasional lack of customer service skills these places are a goldmine for cheap and tasty food. Some of the beer is pretty good too, especially the unpasteurised beers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/775d0h/polish_shop_tips/,1508317169.0,580,0.98,180,CasualUK,kopsy

75kags,Cat shitting in my garden!,"It ends now, today, this is it, I've fucking had it.
Not once in the last 3 years have I mowed my lawn without trying to pick up runny cat shit, the bag split earlier 
in the week and I had liquid cat shit in between my fingers and under my nails I thought, ""I aint having this.""

I've tried a couple of half arsed attemps before to sort this shit out, I pissed into a 3 litre coke bottle for a week
(yellow as fuck I need to rehydrate a bit) ""Sprinkle it around the garden, they hate the testoterone"" or some shit, it did fuck all!

I looked like I had mental health issues when my mates came round and I had 3 liters of piss sitting next to the bog.
""Hang a couple of broken CD's from the trees!"" ""Fuck off, useless.""

It ends now,I need to get tooled up! so I booted it down to Wilkos and loaded every fucking cat repellent I could find, liquid crystals,
spray, flakes, spikes, 2 double barrel nerf guns and a super soaker. 

I got 3 ultrasonic cat reppelers, 3 fake cats with marble eyes and a 
PestBye jet spray motion activated repeller from Amazon.

I set up my old phone with an app called Alfred, motion activated security camera, I set up my phone to receive notifications of any motion detected.

Lets have it you big ginger cunt!

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE 1: I've engaged the enemy, the devil himself: https://imgur.com/a/zXzQm
I got a couple of shots off and then ran out but he escaped :/ https://imgur.com/a/txsuh

&amp;nbsp;

Here's some of the weaponry I purchased I emptied the whole bottle repellent spray over the shed and fence and 
he was just sat right in the middle of it https://imgur.com/a/QtfG3

&amp;nbsp;

The only thing that I think is working are the ultrasonic repellers I had one and it seemed to work for a week so 
now I'e got 3 https://imgur.com/a/Q9g8B

&amp;nbsp;

My main weapon has arrived I'm setting this up now https://imgur.com/a/mA12G

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the Alfred app set up sends a notification when it detects any movement https://imgur.com/a/qERc5

&amp;nbsp;

I told my brother about everything I've done and he said ""Who do you think you are fucking Rambo?""

&amp;nbsp;

Main tool installed! I might move it to cover the shed atm https://i.imgur.com/uKukL0b.gif

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE 2: Tonight's trap has been set https://i.imgur.com/vrvvx5N.gif
I think this is where he gets in and sits on the edge of the shed, I'm going to set up the motion control camera to run off power in my car, I'm getting a hard on! I'll be in the pub waiting for that sweet notification! have a good night!

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE 3: No sign of the little ginger shitter.

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE 4: In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them.....

758wr5,KFC's Double Down Burger - A Review: 2/10,"Today saw the lunchy launch of the Double Down burger at KFC. I like KFC, I like chicken, I thought this would be faultless. It's bacon and cheese but instead of bread, it's chicken breast as a bun! Perfect, right?

However, disappointed is not the word. Let's establish one thing about burgers. The bread is more than just a soft meat-glove, it is crucial for the holding of the burger. And you may not fully appreciate the vitality of bread until you have replaced them with greasy, SCOLDINGLY HOT and rough-as-hell chicken breasts. How in all that is holy are you supposed to HOLD this thing? Do you keep it in the bag and eat it like a burrito? With the sauce in the middle acting as a greasy lubricant it made the whole debacle akin to trying to wrestle some well-oiled turtles.

Which brings me on to the sauce. Some of you will like bbq sauce and won't see this as a problem, but the issue I have with it is that Barbecue Sauce completely overpowers all other flavours of whatever you put it on. It is like the Japanese Knotweed of sauce. You could put a thimble full of BBQ sauce into a tin of paint, neck the lot and only taste the sauce. This was a complete burger ruiner right from the first bite. The cheese and bacon in the middle are cheap and you'll find trying to hold them both in between the chicken like trying to balance a fish between two dying otters.

It's 540 calories (roughly the same as a Big Mac) but inherently worse for you because of the greater number of calories that are empty. For an extra pound you get the meal deal, and another 350 calories on top.

Finally, it's a solid fiver. A fiver for a bacon and cheese version. It simply isn't worth it. The only saving grace is that the chicken itself is relatively tasty, once you have managed to find a bit not tainted by barbecue lube.

74n7xp,I’ve made a bit of a fuck up.,"Throwaway because this just happened at work.


I‘m working full time as a courier, company van, nice and obvious. Now most people I meet are apathetic, some very friendly and a few raging arseholes.

This customer falls into the latter category.



I ring the doorbell and wait a while before a man in a wheelchair answers.

“Morning! Parcel for Mr.*******?”

“Where the fuck have you been?”

Alright. Good start.

“Excuse me?”

“You’re fucking over a week late you muppet! You were supposed to be here on Monday!”

Right. Because obviously I keep all your shit in my garage and just deliver it if I like it. 

Luckily all our posting labels have the date they were printed on so I gave that a quick check, and surprise, suprise. The label was printed **yesterday**.

“I don’t think so sir, it’s been sent on a two day service and it’s a day early. Says here on the label look...”

“Don’t give me any of that shit. I know what you cunts are up to!”

The guy signs the PDA but looks like he’s about to blow a vessel. Then I try to do some damage repair, be helpful and give the guy a card for customer services.

And that’s where I fucked up.

“Look, here’s the number for the claims team. Give it a go but as far as that label you goes I don’t think you’ve a leg to stand on.”

As I hand him the card I look down at his wheelchair. 
He’s a double amputee. Fuck. Time to go!

I have had the ""pleasure"" of working in five different offices in my four years having left University (dae I'm old XD) and have encountered a wide variety of people. Let's take a look. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Nutrition Natalie** 
 
I think I hate Natalie more than most other people who have ever lived. As soon as you reach into your desk to pull out a snack, whether that be a satsuma, a handful of almonds or an entire beef wellington, Natalie is on hand to stomp up to your desk to remind you that you are indeed poisoning your body and the consumption of whatever you are about to eat will surely cause your innards to explode. I have some advice for all of the Natalie's in this world, please bend over and actually fuck your own face. I have another 50 years or so left to be alive and if I want to have a goddamn fucking snack to munch on while I listen to you dribble on about The Only Way is Somerset, or Coronation Farm, I am going to do so with or without your dietary instruction. Fuck! 
 
__________________________________________________  
**Foghorn Fearne** 
 
*Now ah say ah say boy*, Foghorn Fearne is not the delightful southern chicken that frequents early morning cartoons but is in fact the team secretary who is unable to communicate in anything other than a shrill, nasally tone that sends shivers down the spine like a sharp knife against a china plate. Foghorn Fearne spends more time doing her nails and flirting with the delivery men than actually passing on important emails and calls but is so damn ""bubbly"" that you just have to love her despite her inability to perform simple tasks.  
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Inappropriate Ian** 
 
Ian, Ian, Ian. I'm happy that you went on a date and I'm happy it went well but please stop your sentence before you tell us she had a fanny like a dropped kebab, kicked around a barbershop floor. This is an office, not the local boozer and although I *do* kind of want to hear your stories, save it for a Friday night when I'm not in polite company. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Depth-Charge Darren** 
 
Although Darren is in the office for 7 hours, he spends 3 of those in the toilet curling out an assortment of turds. The dreaded ""shitters blocked"" email is sent out and all eyes on Darren, who unashamedly informs those around him that he has been having some stomach issues. *Darren mate, you've been doing this daily and for years*. Might be all the beef wellington he's been eating at his desk. 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Manager Mike** 
 
The worst kind of manager. He simply must tell everyone that he is the manager, and you are the associate. *How's the weather looking this weekend Mike?* ""Well as a manager, I've heard it will be sunny with intermittent showers"". 
 
Usually only a manager because he's hung around the company too long like one of Darren's depth-charges, Mike has taken his managerial training from the school of David Brent, often sporting the same horrid facial hair.

737nh1,How hard is it to get a man to the GP? *Final update!*,"Lads and ladettes of CasUk. I'm back with an update. 

For those of you just looping in, partner had some sort of fit, tried to play it down, I strong-armed him into seeing his GP and moaned about it on reddit (got loads of wonderful advice, thank you guys), his GP sent him to a nice italian doctor who ordered an MRI ~~to find a brain~~ to check everything's a-ok.

Everything is not okay.

My ~~pain in the arse~~ *lovely partner* has what's known as Intercranial Vascular Malformation. In short terms: ~~He's got a screw loose~~ sorry. He has a large mass on one of the blood vessels to his brain and it's given him epilepsy. 

Score one for the ~~meddling biddy~~ concerned girlfriend and reddit at large! 

At this point, we're still reeling from the diagnosis and his particulars have been sent to a team up in Newcastle to look at. Options are:  ~~Become the Hulk~~ get radiotherapy or get surgery. No bangs to the head, heavier meds to control possible fits and no work - at all (that made him *super* happy, let me tell you!) and oh yeah - we're getting married in a week.

*Well FUCK!*

I knew something was up when he asked me to marry him. 

We shall endure! We'll have a pint and wait for this whole thing to blow over. Oh, wait, he can't drink on his meds. More for me! (I love him, really.)

Thank you to everyone who has kept up with this insane saga. We know what's wrong, I was right, we're getting it fixed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/737nh1/how_hard_is_it_to_get_a_man_to_the_gp_final_update/,1506690325.0,89,0.96,31,CasualUK,McStaken

- Had a sudden growth spurt and ended up with ankle swingers because your parents are tight and don't want to spend all their cash on new clothes for their growing son and would rather he just be called ankle swingers by the other kids (I'm not bitter!!) 
 
- Had a weird self-mutilating kid who would burn a whole in his skin using a can of deodorant or etch the name of his crush into his forearm using a compass. 
 
- The future druggy kid who would sit in class and give his marker pen a right good sniff, pretending to be off his nut.

Furthest north is [6 benches on Ornkey](https://openbenches.org/#58.49369/-3.054199/6).  Could do with some more in [Wales](https://openbenches.org/#52.56967/-3.647461/7) and [NI](https://openbenches.org/#54.41254/-7.196045/7) though.

72qw2f,A pilot study into tea bag weights to investigate the conspira-tea hypothesis,"Following on from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/714kap/a_conspiratea/) I took my set of micrometre scales to tea bags in my home and workplace. 

The samples are:  
* Yorkshire Tea  
* Tesco Apple &amp; Cinnamon Tea  
* 'Diplomat' Lemon &amp; Ginger (from Aldi or Lidl I think)  
* ASDA Peppermint Tea  
* ASDA Green Tea  
* Tetley Tea - these were not paired, but I weighed a load anyway to compare the weights and variation with Yorkshire Tea  

Full results can be found on a google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lGL7wpTPxQlBRcg1MM696Ldz6cdsfwdF_HWF9ljWR4g/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to use the data to make your own analysis.

### Methodology

I separated bags in pairs, weighing each one on a micrometer scale [like so](https://i.imgur.com/usMWDiW.jpg), ensuring the scale returned to zero between each measurement. 

A serious shortcoming of the experiment was that the scales haven't been recently calibrated. The weights may not be precise and should be used only for comparison with bags weighed on the same set of scales.

### Main results

[Table here](https://i.imgur.com/vZ4bNUw.jpg) because fuck trying to format a table on reddit, they are always unreadable on mobile. 

**Tea bag variation in a pair**  
Tea (number of sample pairs) - % difference between lightest and heaviest tea bag in a pair  
* Yorkshire Tea(18) - 1.7%  
* Tesco Apple &amp; Cinnamon(10) - 11.7%  
* 'Diplomat' Lemon &amp; Ginger(10) - 7.2%  
* ASDA Peppermint Tea(10) - 5.41%  
* ASDA Green Tea(10) - 5.37%  

**Tea bag variation overall**  
Tea(number of bags) - average weight - range of weights - &amp;difference between highest and lowest  
* Yorkshire Tea(36) - 3.5g - 0.31g - 8%  
* Tesco Apple &amp; Cinnamon(20) - 2.5g - 0.8g - 27%  
* 'Diplomat' Lemon &amp; Ginger(20) - 2.5g - 0.6g - 23%  
* ASDA Peppermint(20) - 2.3g - 0.6g - 24%  
* ASDA Green Tea(20) - 2.7g - 0.6g - 19%  
* Tetley Tea(40) - 2.3g - 0.5g - 21%  

### Conclusions

There is some merit to the conspira-tea with some brands, although the difference isn't that high and was statistically insignificant in the case of Yorkshire Tea. Variation between tea bag weights in a box varies between brands with Yorkshire Tea being the most consistent.

I only had Yorkshire and Tetley available to compare with black teas, Yorkshire Tea contains more tea per bag and has less variation between bags, which we hypothesise would lead to a more consistent cup of tea. I did not however separate tea from bag, so it could be that the bags are heavier.

This was a pilot study and further measurements are required with calibrated scales, a greater quantity of samples and wider range of teas.

### Further observations

Tetley tea was the easiest to separate by not being paired to begin with. Among paired bags Yorkshire and ASDA brands were the easiest to separate. Tesco were the most difficult and I cannot recommend 'Diplomat' because while middling on the ease of tearing them apart at least half the bags were stuck to the row of bags below.

71pq8w,I finally did it.,"I actually, finally did it. I followed the compass’s N as far as I'd ever been before.


I'm from East Sussex, small town just north of Eastbourne and I just got back from my trip up north to my cousin's wedding and I must say I had a great time up there. It wasn't what my fellow southerners had warned me about. It was barely colder than what I've experienced on England's sunshine coast, not even a flake of snow. When I was told the north was full of dull, grey and boring buildings I was dreading it, but I actually really enjoyed the diverse and beautiful architecture you guys have up there.


As for the locals, I only had one problem but in fairness I'd just rocked out of the reception at 2am into the middle of a busy part of the night scene, what place doesn't have the odd drunkard? In all I met some lovely people, if I asked for directions I was politely told or shown the way, sat waiting for the train a few locals even struck up a conversation with me about the book I was reading (book 4 in the Wheel of Time series). You guys really are quite lovely really.


So really what I'm trying to say is, I really enjoyed my trip to Royal Tunbridge Wells.

She tried to help but I had some problems following her instructions so in the end she put me through to a senior chap. He explained the stopped processes on my PC indicated I had a virus. I felt we were making progress but he sounded as though he was getting more and more frustrated at my slowness and inability to follow simple instructions. They were both being helpful so didn't like to mention I have 35 years working in IT.  In the end he just hung up.

6x6h3m,The Gym Types,"Now I am a man who is striving for physical excellence. I'm not, that's a lie, but I like to hit up the gym erry day so that I can drink and eat as much as I want on the weekends. 
 
Having trained in 10 or so different gyms in the past few years, I'm pretty certain that every gym has the same cohort.  
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Big fucking Dan** 
 
Big fucking Dan is am absolute unit. He's usually called Dan, or Ben, basically any one syllable name that makes it easier for him to spell. He's at least 6 foot 10 and weighs about 20 stone in rippling muscle. Doesn't matter if you go to the gym at 7am or 10pm the following day, Big fucking Dan will be there with that horrifying red face and tribal tattoo.  
 
BFD will often be curling the 50kg dumbbells and then just leave them lying around, which causes you much embarrassment when you're unable to pick them up to take them back to the rack. Cheers Dan, you gimp.
 
*N.B. more often than not, BFD will have thin legs as he only works out the glamour muscles*.  
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Instagram Imogen** 

She's the one in the sports bra and waist high leggings. She's thin, ripped and has an arse that could crush a walnut as she spends 10 hours a day in the squat rack, only stopping to take more side angle photos with the pouty lips and arse sticking out. We all would if we could, Imogen. 
 
*N.b. She's the sort who will have on her Tinder bio ""not interested if all your photos are you in the gym"", while all of her photos are of her in the gym*. 
__________________________________________________ 
**Punchbag Pete** 
 
My favourite gym member, Punchbag Pete is a 40 year old accountant with a beer belly and heavily receding hairline who will spend the entire session hitting the punchbag at penis height. He uses no boxing techniques, he barely moves his feet but he's punching that bag with a mean right hook, most likely pretending it's one of his clients.  
 
*N.b. PP only stops punching to occasionally sob into his gloves* 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Angry Andrew** 
 
Well known for his catchphrase, ""Are you using that mate?"". Andrew will wait for you to get a bench, bring your dumbbells over (massive ones if you're a beast like me) before approaching you to ask ""You using this bench mate?"". I'm fucking sat on it Andrew, of course I'm fucking using it. He'll then skulk away muttering under his breath. 
 
*N.b. wait for Andrew to get into his car, post session and slide into the passenger seat. ""You driving this car mate?"", you ask cheekily.* 
 
*N.b.b. I am not responsible for any injuries you may receive* 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Cardio Colin** 
  
He just runs. He runs and he runs and he runs. You get into the gym and he's running on the treadmill. You leave the gym an hour later and he's still running. He's basically a human hamster, running from the woes in his life. 
 
*N.b. He's usually wearing a really short pair of short shorts; the older Cardio Colin is, the more likely it is that his bollocks will be slapping the inside of his legs as he runs.* 
 
__________________________________________________ 
**Protein Paul** 
 
He's usually a stick thin wee lad, curling 5kg dumbbells (often in the squat rack) before bleating on about all the protein he has each day. All the eggs, all the shakes, all the bars, he's an animal who lives for the protein. Clearly doing it wrong there Paul, I've seen you in here for the past 6 months and you haven't gained a pound. 
 
*N.b. maybe he's actually Cardio Colin on the sly, which would explain the huge calorie deficit*.

6x5ttz,A rant regarding modern day trendy burgers,"Call me crazy but I was under the impression that a burger was something you could hold in your hand a take a bite out of.

Why, as of late, are trendy establishments insisting on serving ridiculous towers of food that could very loosely fall into the definition of ""burger""? 

What is the obsession with brioche? 

Where the hell are my sesame seeds?

Since when did a burger patty more resemble a fist than a disc?

Is this some sort of snobbery at work? Fast food places and take aways now seem to be the only establishments that sell burgers you could hold in one hand and take a bite out of; has the great wave of gentrification decided that burgers which are in any way practical are some sort of disgusting food of the prole?

Come on. Those single squares of cheese you get in chippys and McDonalds are not infected with fucking smallpox. When they melt they're delicious. Get over yourself.

Who else still appreciates a big round, thin patty with shitty ""cheese"" on it served in a slightly toasted seeded bread bun? Holy shit look at that, I don't even need a skewer to stop it falling over. 

**The very fact that it's even possible for a burger to ""fall over"" should concern us all.**

6u0875,This is why arena/concert food is so shit.,"I used to work as a casual/zero-hours food prep person in my local concert arena, and I'm not going to lie - it was atrocious. I'm surprised, coming from such a big company, they let this happen.

I was given absolutely no training whatsoever, literally just placed into the kitchen with another 17/18 year old who had to show me how to do everything. This was my first job, so obviously I lacked common sense, and nobody told me I shouldn't be wearing a watch in the kitchen so I nearly dropped it into a deep-fat fryer. Oh yeah - working with boiling oil, and not given a single word of training? What a joke. 

Everything was so hopeless, it's almost laughable. We had roughly 40 minutes before the doors opened to cook and prepare beef burgers, chicken burgers, hot dogs and fries, and though it sounds like a lot of time, it's not, especially when, after 3 shifts, I was deemed ""experienced enough"" to be placed with another completely new person so it was just the two of us with not a clue of what to do...

The fries were AWFUL, and I still feel guilty about them. They were hard and stuck together so you had to bite into one massive block of potato.We'd make a batch and keep them under the hot light for hours, to the point where obviously nobody would like them, but honestly, this being my first ever job, could you expect any less?

They bollocked you if you wasted too much food but didn't give a shit about whether you knew how to make it in the first place or whether it was actually good enough for the customers, which it wasn't. I feel bad about how ripped-off they were. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6u0875/this_is_why_arenaconcert_food_is_so_shit/,1502864799.0,70,0.96,47,CasualUK,[deleted]

6sseza,REVIEW: Breakfast Pot,"Due to the demands of about five people from [my post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6sm2jn/yesterday_i_found_out_that_cardiff_does_a_cooked/) I decided to brave it all and try the breakfast in a pot today. 

First off this is the meat-eater version feat. my strong, manly hands: http://imgur.com/a/L015Q 

And this is what it looked like when I first opened it: http://imgur.com/a/EkRhA 

I thought there was a mistake and somehow they'd managed to package some strange soup instead of my breakfast pot but upon closer inspection I realised that that was actually all molten cheese. After some digging through the pot that Time Team would have been proud of I discovered that there were some actual solid masses of a poached egg, baked beans and mushrooms inside which looked like this: http://imgur.com/a/JY3Tr 

Now you might be asking why on earth is this breakfast pot on top of a plate doesn't that defeat the whole purpose? Why yes you would be correct. It turns out that the surface temperature of the outside of the pot was roughly the same temperature of the sun and therefore the woman at the till gave me a plate to carry it on.  Utterly pointless. 

Taste: Overall I'd rate at about 6/10. Nothing special but it was alright, I might have given it another point but I hate mushrooms. 

Presentation: 2/10. I mean it's a bunch of food in a pot so I wasn't expecting much but still it looked awful.

Cost: 4/10 it was about £2.50 but then it was half empty so I think I got ripped off slightly. 

Experience: 5/10. An odd experience that I probably won't be repeating but this review is giving me a great excuse to procrastinate from doing my dissertation.

6sruts,A night of abject misery on a National Express,"Sorry this is ranty. But I'd never experienced a long range coach journey before.

I got 2 hours sleep last night, spending the night experiencing what I can only describe as being locked in a moving abattoir. The person before me had left their garbage in the seat net thing so it stank of discarded food, it was cramped and hot and my hopes of a quiet coach were dashed, because who in their right mind would get a 9 hour coach? Actually, quite a lot of people, it turns out. None of whom looked like they wanted to be there.

I once stayed awake for 36 hours on a coach – I don’t sleep well on public transport. This was made harder by the bizarre experience of every hour or so, just as you might be nodding off, the in-coach lights erupt into a supernova of illuminance, revealing all the fellow scummy self-loading freight in hideous ultravision clarity, and a Glastonbury-style tannoy announcement explodes over the speakers, loudly boasting of their arrival ahead of time into the warm embrace of Stoke-on-Trent.

But there was one incredible second layer to this painful journey. In the seat across the aisle from me was a butter churn of a woman, squeezed into some well-worn leggings, smelling like she’d been dragged through a farm by some very ill cattle. She had obviously paid for two seats as she sprawled her bumps and bags over both of them. Her clumsiness was staggering; within 2 hours, she’d spilled her 2L bottle of Dr Pepper onto her laptop, then dropped the bottle, dropped the laptop onto the floor while she tried to writhe into a more comfy position, twice dropped her phone, knocked down her bag from the seat three times and twice slapped the head of the guy in front while trying to use his chair to gain leverage. She also hadn’t brought any headphones, which became everyone else’s problem when she put shows on at 3am. The most disturbing and upsetting was the 25-second scratch on her greasy temple (I timed it as she seemed to be going for a personal best) and then had a triumphant sniff of her full four fingers like she’d just scooped up a chocolate fountain. She was a hazard to every sensory apparatus I possess. I daren’t touch her but I imagined she felt like a gammon steak stuck in a gritting truck. 

I didn’t use my laptop because I didn’t want to run down the battery. 8 and a half hours into the 9 hour journey I noticed a plug socket between the seats. That would have been very useful many hours ago, I thought to myself, as I fell off the coach with a numb arse, a sore back, and more tired than I was when I got on. It was much, much cheaper than the train. But much, much worse. I thought, being National Express, it might be a better experience than a Megabus. It wasn’t.  And here I am sitting in a McDonald’s in Edinburgh with a face a mixture of shock, bewilderment, insomnia, fury and resignation.

6ry7ch,The /r/CasualUK Full English Breakfast Survey: Results,"You will likely have noticed that whenever a photo of a Full English is posted to reddit (be it here or on a food subreddit) there are inevitable arguments about what is or isn't good about it, what constitutes a ""true"" Full English, why you're a cunt for preferring streaky bacon to back bacon and so on.  
  

I wanted to get a definitive breakfast established by the use of community survey, and I believe that I have accomplished that. You can definitely tell that I am between jobs at the moment.  
  

NB: I am not a data-ologist and if anyone thinks they can present this data in a better and more meaningful way to reap that sweet /r/dataisbeautiful karma then message me and I can send you the full results in Excel for you to play with.  
  

#The survey in brief  
  

You can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6rrmu5/the_full_english_breakfast_survey/) but to sum it up, users were asked to rate 20 breakfast/food items on the following scale:  
  

* **TOTAL ESSENTIAL:** if the breakfast does not contain this item, it is not a Full English. A core component.  
* **GOOD OPTIONAL:** the breakfast is still a Full English without this item, but adding it does not ruin the breakfast. I'll have it on mine if I've the option.  
* **BAD OPTIONAL:** the breakfast is still a Full English without this item, and remains so with this item. However, I would not choose to add it to my breakfast, personally.  
* **NO FUCKING WAY:** if this item is included then the breakfast is ruined and/or ceases to be a Full English breakfast, irrespective of whether or not I enjoy the food.  
  

This aimed to take personal preference somewhat out of the race – for example, many people (children) don’t like black pudding, but it would be difficult to argue that it does not have a place in a Full English regardless of whether or not you eat it.  
  

#/r/CasualUK’s Full English Breakfast  
  

Thanks to everyone for taking part. Over the course of the weekend, the surveys received a combined 1,863 results (964 for the first and 899 for the second).   
  

I actually got so into this survey that I paid SurveyMonkey £30 to view all of the results (it is capped at 100 for free members).   
  

Using these results, I was able to determine scientifically and conclusively what does and does not belong in a Full English breakfast.   
  

We therefore have three categories:   
  

* **The Purist’s Full English Breakfast:** without these items, you cannot call your breakfast a Full English.   
* **The Enhanced Full English Breakfast:** a car with a spoiler and chrome rims is still a car, so too is a breakfast with these items still a Full English. Not everyone likes them, but no one can deny that it is still a true Full English.  
* **The What The Fuckfast:** a breakfast containing these items can no longer be considered a Full English Breakfast, regardless of your personal taste or preference.  
  

##The Purist’s Full English Breakfast  
  

Within the first 100 results or so, there were clear frontrunners in this race. Some items had not received a single “No Fucking Way” vote, and they maintained their lead throughout the polling. 
  
 
It baffles me personally how anyone could vote “No Fucking Way” to any of these items, but as time went on some did. However, the listed items received only between 0.1% and 2.5% of votes for “No Fucking Way” which is probably within some margin of error and were the clear winners of this survey.  
  

* Sausage (93.88% Total Essential votes, 0.21% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Bacon (93.46% Total Essential votes, 0.52% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Fried Egg (74.22% Total Essential votes, 0.10% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Toast (50.39% Total Essential votes, 0.21% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Baked Beans (67.22% Total Essential votes, 1.46% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Tea (61.02% Total Essential votes, 2.12% No Fucking Way votes)  
  

Of the items, Baked Beans received the highest “Bad Optional” rating with 9.37% of votes. Sausage received the lowest “Bad Optional” rating with 0.62% of votes. By all metrics, sausage is the most popular and essential item in a Full English Breakfast.  
  

Because of the structure of the survey, every vote except “No Fucking Way” allowed for inclusion in the breakfast. Thus, the core items of a Full English, without which the breakfast is incomplete, are as follows (in order of Total Essential priority):  
  

* Sausage  
* Bacon  
* Tea  
* Fried Egg  
* Baked Beans  
* Toast   
  

##The Enhanced Full English Breakfast  
  

Of course, I don’t think that (personal preference aside) anyone would argue that items like black pudding have no place in a Full English.   
  

This is pretty well-represented in the results, with the following items receiving overwhelming approval (50% or more Total Essential/Good Optional votes combined) despite some “No Fucking Way” votes.  
From most to least popular, the honourable mentions are:  
  

* Black Pudding (25.13% Total Essential votes, 44.03% Good Optional votes)  
* Fried Bread (25.60% Total Essential votes, 58.38% Good Optional votes)  
* Hash Brown (35.37% Total Essential votes, 54.28% Good Optional votes)  
* Tomato (35.04% Total Essential votes, 44.16% Good Optional votes)  
* Mushrooms (32.26% Total Essential votes, 42.32% Good Optional votes)  
  

Some had issue with including both scrambled and fried eggs and streaky/regular bacon as separate entities and I admit that may have been an error. Both options scored highly, meaning that scrambled eggs and streaky bacon are a valid substitute for the traditional fried egg/back bacon.  
  

* Streaky Bacon (10.73% Total Essential votes, 46.26% Good Optional votes)  
* Scrambled Eggs (6.75% Total Essential votes, 65.32% Good Optional votes) 
  
 
##The What The Fuckfast  
  

In the interest of fairness and riling up the sub, I included several ridiculous items that only a fucking maniac would include in a breakfast and call it a Full English – pancakes, burgers and whatnot.  
  

The following items all received 50% or higher No Fucking Way votes:  
  

* Burger (90.30% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Pancakes (75.06% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Kippers (74.44% No Fucking Way votes)  
* Chips (67.57% No Fucking Way votes)

6rrmu5,The Full English Breakfast Survey,"##**[Results are in!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6ry7ch/the_rcasualuk_full_english_breakfast_survey/)** 

You will likely have noticed that whenever a photo of a Full English is posted to reddit (be it here or on a food subreddit) there are inevitable arguments about what is or isn't good about it, what constitutes a ""true"" Full English, why you're a cunt for preferring streaky bacon to back bacon and so on. 

I thought we could take a couple of surveys about everyone's favourite breakfast to try and determine once and for all what are the core elements of a Full English.  

#How it works
In this survey, you will be asked to rate breakfast items on a four-point scale:  

**TOTAL ESSENTIAL:** if the breakfast does not contain this item, it is not a Full English. A core component.   
**GOOD OPTIONAL:** the breakfast is still a Full English without this item, but adding it does not ruin the breakfast. I'll have it on mine if I've the option.   
**BAD OPTIONAL:** the breakfast is still a Full English without this item, and remains so with this item. However, I would not choose to add it to my breakfast, personally.  
**NO FUCKING WAY:** if this item is included then the breakfast is ruined and/or ceases to be a Full English breakfast, irrespective of whether or not I enjoy the food.  

#The surveys
There are two 10-question surveys because that's what SurveyMonkey limits you to with a free account. If you think I've missed items, let me know and I'll create a third survey.

6oim05,The thing I miss most about shopping in Lidl...,"... is their no-nonsense, ""bag your shit and get the fuck out of my shop"" checkout policy. Once we went in there with three people briefed and ready to pack as fast as humanly possible and we *still* couldn't keep up with the guy throwing things through the scanner. It's amazing. You get out of that shop *so* fast when you're done selecting junk food and cheap continental hams.

I was reminded of this in a normal supermarket today by having to wait a vast, yawning eternity for people to sort their shit out - firstly for a couple to play the most careful, drawn-out game of shopping bag Tetris with every item, then for a woman to artfully arrange all her items in the bagging area without bagging them, then bag them carefully one by one while the checkout assistant meekly waited for payment. There's no way Lidl would have put up with that. They'd have kicked all the shopping on the floor and started serving the next person at breakneck speed without a single word.

**Me**: 9/11/XXXX  
  
**Excited receptionist**: Such a date is hard to forget!  
  
I was confused for a second, but realized the meaning of the joke after looking at his beard and skin tone - he was most likely referring to ""The 9.11"".  
  
**Me**: Oh yes! True! But it is not the same 9/11. Americans write their dates incorrectly.  
  
**Receptionist**: Yes, you are right. It was September 11 not November the 9th. Idiots.  
**Me**: Yes. Idiots.
  
After this we went straight to business and the rest of our conversation was much more formal. I don't think he will last long on the job with this kind of sense of humour, but he honestly made my day.

6nsxgx,"New Rule, please have a look!","When I made the sub things were peachier than a big peach, but /u/jptoc advised that it would go to shit at 15,000 subscribers. ""Balderdash and piffle"" I exclaimed in his face. And for the most part I was right *but* I think we can do better, so I have devised a new rule to just keep things the way they were ""in the good old days (March 2017)"".    
  
1. **If you have nothing to add, please don't comment in the thread**  
  
There have been a few threads recently (Glastonbury and Dr Who spring straight to mind) where people have just written something like ""Who cares, this is shit"". Clearly you do care if you've taken the time to write that... I will be removing comments like that and sending a gentle reminder to stop pissing on bonfires. 
 
If the question is ""what do you think about X?"" you are more than welcome to say ""I don't like it because..."" as you're contributing to the conversation. But telling us you hate football in a football thread offers nothing. 
    
  
**A gentle reminder for another rule that I think has fallen besides the roadside** 

1. **Be welcoming**
 
Quite a few of our posts have started hitting /r/All because we're big time, and this leads a few of our friends across the pond to join us on the sub and ask a seemingly ""silly"" question to us Brits, and I've seen them on -20 for asking things like ""what is a crumpet??"" 
 
**Be welcoming**. This is not a sanctuary of the Brits where we gurn at the foreign people coming to join us. I want us to be welcoming to our friends around the world, I want us to be telling them stories of what we get up to, offering advice on where to visit in the UK etc. etc.  
  
You guys are very good at reporting things where Politics has cropped up but please do it for the other rules too! We don't *just* want to keep polos away, we want to keep the bitter, unhelpful and just plain rude comments out too.

6n0sbj,Confession time: crap office pranks,"A few years ago I used to be employed by a small tech startup, where I worked with a guy called Theo. We were the classical bad influences on each other - if we'd been schoolkids, we'd have been the ones the teacher splits up before they've even sat down. Left to our own devices, we'd have each been fine and upstanding office citizens, barring a tendency to giggle at silly ideas every once in a while. Unfortunately, sitting next to each other we had a tendency to egg each other on to the implementation phase, putting stickers on the bottom of mice, unplugging keyboards, encasing things in jelly, and so on.

Sitting opposite us was a tech lead, who we got on with pretty well. This guy was obsessed about getting too hot at work, so he'd dragged a massive freestanding fan (which was supposed to be for the whole office) right next to his desk and had it running at full speed from pretty much March to October.

One day I was chatting to Theo and happened to mention that one of the more enterprising young souls in our old sixth form college had emptied an entire pack of Skittles into a fan once, which was generally agreed to be excellent as it had made a massively catastrophic noise and pinged Skittles and bits of Skittles fucking *everywhere*, to the point that we were still finding them in that classroom on the top of shelves and at the back of cupboards weeks later.

Now, had we not been bad influences on each other this would have passed with a nostalgic smile and a comment on simpler times, and we'd have got back to deserialising XML or whatever we were doing. Unfortunately, this was the point at which Theo helpfully suggested, ""there's a load of those little paper sticks full of sugar in the kitchen, we should get some of those and put them in the tech lead's fan"". So off we trooped to the little communal kitchen, scooped ourselves up a couple of fistfuls of sugar sachets, and returned to the office. We sidled up to said tech lead's desk, ostensibly to ask him about some detail of an API, and dumped a load of sugar sticks in his fan.

It was ace. We were expecting most of them to just fall through the fan, bounce around and make a bit of a racket, but instead it blasted open the paper containers with the fan blades and blew this massive cloud of sugar at high velocity directly into the tech lead's face. As a surprisingly forgiving soul he wasn't sure whether to be angry or find the whole thing hilarious, so ended up yelling for a bit before going for a cup of tea with us.

From that point on, it became our done thing to carry a sugar stick when talking to that tech lead, and gradually trickle small amounts into his fan until he noticed and yelled at us again. We were the worst co-workers. Eventually Theo left and we moved into a more professional-looking office where such antics were monitored more closely, although I do recall some weeks later a telephone call with our old landlords about deductions for, ""several broken floor tiles and an unusual quantity of sugar in one corner of the office"".

Why is the new UI so slow.  Why are the icons so small as if to purposefully hurt the visually less able?

dnqxig,It's better up north and you can not convince me otherwise,"Been living in Reading for 3 years. 900 pound a month rent not including other bills for a box flat. City is dirty , dull and full of rude wankers and feels soulless. 

Visited my dad up here near Preston. He's in the suburbs. Pays 500 a month rent, three bedrooms, garden, lovely quiet area with a great pub social life. Everyone is happy and content around the area and were extremely kind.

6m6f2r,Shout out to the person I fell in love with yesterday,"I was in London on Friday, just wandering around the tube station. I then saw...him. Just in the corner of my eye. 

I don't know how to describe it. Have you ever eaten a REALLY delicious bowl of Ready Brek and you feel like that you are never going to get a better bowl than that in your life, even if you added more sugar? That is what I felt like. I saw him, and he was the ultimate bowl of Ready Brek.

I could...sense that he was into me too. I mean, it was difficult to tell. I am new to this whole 'gaydar' thing but he had that look about him, y'know?

I went up and said hi. He had the most delightful accent in the world. A Welshy-sort-of-accent. It is tough to describe, really. I guess the best way to describe it would be ""if the Ready Brek dragon was real, he would sound like this"".

What followed was a whirlwind few minutes. In those minutes, we walked around, talking about everything and nothing. He told me he was new in London and was confused. I was more than happy to show him my way of life.

At the end of it, we planned to meet up again. I think he was so 'head over heels', he never heard. I gave him £10 to get to the local Starbucks a few hours later, but he never arrived. It was a shame.

I have a post up on Craigs List right now for 'Missed Connections', but I doubt I will ever find him again.

We have been added to the neurological consultation list at our local hospital. Partner had the vampire nurses attack him for bloods (to check for other underlying causes that may look similar) and got a furiously good lecture by the GP about how I'm doing this for his benefit and I have every right to be worried.

I have also been advised that should it happen again, even for seconds, to request an ambulance (which put him in an even better mood, let me tell you!) 

He is now currently sulking and terrified it IS some type of Epilepsy but has finally relented and agreed that it is best to know and manage this before a serious incident occurs. 

I have never been so thankful for the NHS and my ability to get an appointment the day after. We're in good hands.

6jev41,My roast potato story,"My husband and I went out today for a sit down roast at the local pub. You know the posh kind where they bring your plate out from the kitchen, and are in sole charge of roasties, yorkies and gravy? Never mind I had spent almost a year touring the local area trying to find the perfect carvery, the one where even the pigs in blankets are help yourself, and yorkshires (my fave part of the roast) are all you can eat. Dave wanted to go to the posh pub one because its 'nicer' than the carvery. Anyway, back to the more expensive yet stingier roast I had today... I got three roast potatoes on my plate, and they were crispy, I mean you could tell just by looking at them that you're going to need to reorientate your knife from cutting position to stabbing position to see it through. As I tried to cut into one it flew off my plate onto the carpet. I had a serious moment of anguish where I considered wiping it off and eating it anyway, when suddenly a waitress came by. I must have sounded so pathetic as I explained to her how the potato was so crispy it went flying, and would be please be able to bring me a replacement potato. She said she would go fetch me one from the kitchen. Sure, my husband ripped the piss out of me, but his face when the waitress came back with an entire bowl of roasties and just plonked them down in front of me was fucking golden. I negotiated a yorkshire pudding swap (his was by far bigger than mine) before I allowed him access to the roastie bowl. And there it is, my roast potato story. Beat that!

6h32q0,British Reality Cop Shows,"Aren't they just excellent? Not exciting like the American ones with 19 Crown Victorias chasing someone who's nicked a tank and filled it with machine guns. Not all po-faced and sensible like the Australian ones where they're all like, ""you were doing 43 kilometres per hour over the speed limit mate, we're going to have to confiscate your licence.""

None of that for us. Instead, we get the joys of, ""rapid response cop PC Kevin White suspects that this moped might be STOLEN."" Then they chase it through a park, the thief legs it and hides in a wheelie bin, so they get the chopper up or if it's one of the more rural police forces send a spaniel out to sniff round the bins for a bit. There's inevitably someone in a Clio who gets stopped for some utterly mundane reason, starts an argument, and turns out to have a glovebox full of weed. Plus the token drunk shocked as to why the police have any interest in the fact he's just driven his Vectra across a playground and crashed into a Wicksteed slide.

Our favourite is that one where they show computer-game style profiles of the traffic cops with statistics like, ""Favourite pursuit car: Skoda Octavia. Favourite colour: yellow. Favourite bald musician: Phil Collins.""

6gylog,What stereotype about the UK winds you up the most?,"It's a glorious day today, I was walking to work this morning with my jacket off as it is too warm to wear it, the birds were singing, the sun's out, there's greenery *everywhere*, the lady at the coffee shop smiled and said good morning when I popped in for a coffee.  In short,  I couldn't help but think about how life here is all right.

So it winds me right up when I come on Reddit and see people - including a lot of my fellow Brits - banging on about how we live on a cold and gloomy island where it rains constantly.  The other stereotype that was all over [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6g7js0/what_should_you_not_do_when_you_go_to_england/) is that we don't talk to strangers, and that visiting tourists shouldn't speak to anyone.  What the fuck?  The Britain I know is full of right chatty people, people who will happily talk to you about any given subject.  To see people from this country telling the rest of the world is like that annoys me.  So what stereotypes annoy you?

6ew3lv,Let's talk ducks and duck related things.,"Hi All,  
 
Following up on Beavs message earlier which seems to have not gone down well, I had hoped to explain why we have decided to remove all duck related content going forwards from the Sub.  
  
We are still a new community trying to find our place on Reddit. What are we, what do we want to achieve and what content do we want to see. We're averaging around 50 - 100 new subscribers every day and we want to see those figures continue to rise (hopefully one day we might earn our place as ""The United Kingdom subreddit""). What we don't want is for the sub to pop up somewhere, a load of people join and what they see is pages of *terrible* photos of ducks - let's be honest there.  
  
We'll be introducing **""Wildlife Wednesdays""** from next week which will be a stickied thread where I want you to fill it up with ducks, squirrels, foxes and whatever other animals we have in the UK, or if you're better travelled, show us an Elephant. There will be a prize each week for the top voted animal photo!  
  
I understand that this is not a popular decision, as I can tell from the dozens of reports calling us Nazis and what have you but we have to keep the front page tidy, fresh and worth clicking on.  
  
As always, we love hearing your suggestions for making the sub better and to get as many people to join in as possible. 
 
Thank you,

6dmiof,Accidental pidgeon theft,"Ahead is a long and boring account, but essentially my family have accidentally stolen a pidgeon, I think.

It just turned up in our garden one day, so we fed it. Once it realised that our house was free food however it decided to stay, which we weren't​ expecting.

My dad at this point named it Percy and started talking to it, but that's pretty standard dad behaviour right? The issue is that he lets it into the house.

At some point we noticed it had a tag on. Looking it up online it apparently comes from near Southampton way. The website told us ""not to allow it liberty"", but we're all too scared to try and pick it up.

At this point Percy feels like part of the family and we don't really​ to see him go, however it does technically belong to someone, so we're conflicted.

Any pidgeon experts who can offer advice would be much appreciated.

6dgq1p,I've been called upon as a first aider for the first time because one guy headbutted another at work AMA,"Bit of background- I work in a shitty bit of Birmingham doing chemicals and powder coating. I'm the only person on the shop floor with a GCSE.        
___     
Guy 1 and 2 don't like each other. They're the type who always chat about ""polo"" at work, biting each others head off etc. Recently they've been extremely petty about tea supplies at work.       
Yeah we're a fucking stereotype deal with it.        
The pair of them have an argument over it on monday, don't speak to each other for the rest of the week. Fine.      
Apparently guy 1 wants to get something out the warehouse, guy 2 is doing something in there. Guy 1 asks 2 to ""move your fucking truck out the way"".       
Guy 2 says something to the effect of ""manners, don't speak to me like that"".         
Guy 1 gets off his forklift and nuts 2.          
___      
First I hear of this is the manager running to get me and asking me to have a look at guy 2. He has a nicely swollen cheek with a cut, but it's all clean, no concussion or cheek bone break as far as I can tell and the swelling goes down after application of a makeshift icepack (I ended up ripping the furry ice from the inside of the freezer out). He rings the police while I'm assessing him, and we then have to persuade him to stay and wait for the HR lady to appear to get a statement from him.        
___       
After all this, his mate picks him up and I'm satisfied he's not going to keep over and die, but guy 2 takes down guy 1's car reg and make, swearing blind he's not coming in on tuesday (he's in on an agency contract) and that once guy 1 is sacked guy 2 will ""sort it his way"". Fun.      
Some people from the other bit of the factory ask me what happened, and scoff when I mention he rang the police.     
""What a pussy, should sort it himself.""      
I point out the police could potentially do something, and one of the older (otherwise sound) guys says ""Nah, it's not really how we sort it round here.""

- We've been held at this platform for a few minutes due to a ""customer incident"" at Westferry. No idea what's happened, but I bet *someone's shit themselves*.  
- If you're feeling a little tight for space, just elbow the man next to you in the ribs. It will probably make your day that little bit better, even if it makes his a little worse.  
- My favourite part of this job is watching morons bouncing off the doors once they've closed. It's like being in a zombie movie!  
- If you lose any of your possessions, please log onto my own personal website where you can claim them back for a small fee. It's 215 days to Christmas and I have children to feed.  
- Have a wonderful day everyone. Work hard, play nicely and do your DLR conductor proud.

6cndd0,Just passed my driving test!,"At the ripe old age of 28 I finally took my first driving test this morning, and somehow passed first time! Thought it was all over when I knocked the kerb on the parallel park, but the examiner was great and said ""it was only a graze. Bet you thought you failed there though eh?""

Now to annoy all you drivers by going 30mph everywhere and being too afraid to come out of that junction and just sitting there for 5 minutes looking for a clear road.  

Anyone else got theirs coming up soon?

6c2uh6,I've had 2 shifts at Wetherspoons. Here's an update.,"If I remember correctly the first pint I pulled was a John Smiths a little while after 1 (my shift started at 1) I can't really be more specific than that, because I can't really remember (I forget everything when I'm tired.) That first shift, I was on the bar for the full shift, but it was fun, and that was Wednesday. I wasn't too good at the ales, with the hand pumps, if I go too quickly, it ends up being really frothy and they kinda complain, if I go slowly, they complain I'm being slow. There was 1 rude customer, he asked for a tall glass, and I asked if a tulip glass would be OK, and he asked for a tall one, I then asked if a Strongbow glass was OK, and he got annoyed saying ""it's just a f**king glass, don't be so fussy"" and he was the one who asked for it in the first place. I just hope that karma deals some passive-aggressive revenge to him.

Yesterday, they put me on the bar again at first, and they got me to wash some glasses, restock the cupboard (which I had to stop partway through, since they needed me to go back onto the bar) and then in the evening, they asked me to go on the floor and waiter food. It was hectic, to say the least. They have this pager thingie, which vibrates when food needs delivering, and while I'm also delivering food, I need to check back on everyone's meal, clear plates from tables, and deliver glasses to the glass wash, and every Thursday, a nightclub opposite (Sin City) has a Sin Savers night, so there are loads of students. I pretty much had to weave around them, looking for whatever table needed food, check if there were any empty plates to take back to the kitchen, and I just about got that done. By the time I had to leave, I had barely taken any glasses back or reset the tables, but I apparently did good. And for my first shift on the floor, on a hectic day anyway, I did my best, considering I was the only one delivering food, and on the floor. I was also offered to work later, but since I rely on public transport, I didn't think I could get a lift so maybe another time.

I am enjoying it, but it's tiring, but it seems rewarding, so far.

Edit: I just remembered, on my first day a staff member (not me) smashed a glass, and I cleaned it up for them, because they couldn't find the dustpan and brush and they were kitchen staff too. Also, I had to make a pitcher of woo woo, at 3 o'clock, I think. I also made some gins and got one of the regulars many sambuca shots.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6c2uh6/ive_had_2_shifts_at_wetherspoons_heres_an_update/,1495190320.0,106,0.95,84,CasualUK,[deleted]

___________________

No longer is my waking gaze met with the latest perilous leadership forecast from 7 different media outlets - it's just a wholesome job update from u/JamesEynon98 (good luck with the trial shift, mate!). My feed isn't full of flip-flopping politics or parliamentary pissing contests - it's packed with deep and meaningful discussions about the weirdest train conversations you've ever had, or the best crisps to eat when you're visiting the shittest seaside towns.


r/CasualUK delivers a more easy-going social experience, but it's more than that. It serves a oft-forgotten slice of what being British is all about, a shop-bought Victoria sponge of a reminder that our silly little island is still big enough to have a laugh on.

68sxa3,Sad post: I am hoping to rehome my (rather casual) cat. Any takers here? Support/ subsidy offered,"1) The story.

We had four cats, ages 11, 6, 3 and 2. Two weeks ago, the youngest, Sophie, was run over outside the house- she had previously seemed to have perfect road sense. We are very sad, but in particular my other half is completely grief-stricken. We don't have children; I guess the cats are the children, therefore.

Here is an album from happier times, which I have posted here before - the deceased cat is the little white Birman: 

http://imgur.com/a/IBzcA

My other half works a lot from home, so she is in a lot and Sophie was her constant companion. Sophie did actually have an angelic character, and she was really nice to everyone, whether human or feline.

Now, the problem is that Sophie was really the glue that held everyone together. Apart from being very affectionate and entertaining, she also defused tensions among the other cats, and made Mrs tmstms less miffed by how crap the other cats are.

The 11 year-old, Solomon, is actually really sweet....sometimes. But he has always had some weird mental problem (he is from South Wales, but somehow ended up in London as a kitten) and he can lash out.

The 6 year-old, Poppy, is really sweet, but she is timid, and gets bullied by the two boys. Sophie somehow knew how to calm the boys down, so it's worse for Poppy without her.

Finally, the 3 year-old, Alfred, is the one who needs a new home.

2) Why Alfred is a problem.

tl;dr - makes things emotionally harder + worried the boys will gang up on the girl.

a) Sophie really loved Alfred, and he did love her too, but he seems to have gone on as normal, and it's really upsetting Mrs tmstms to see his boisterous and casual self around when Sophie is not around. 
 
b) By 'around' though- he does go out a lot, and in particular he visits other people, above all a neighbour two doors down, but other households too. So he is a ""semi-detached"" cat, not, it would appear, that attached to us, arguably more attached to the neighbour, but returning to get his food. So Mrs tmstms sees him as a bit greedy and entitled.

c) The neighbour has a cat flap, but we do not- we bring the cats in to sleep at night. She made Alfred welcome when he went in her house, and he started spending enough time there that we offered him to her. But she declined. We think it is because she does not want the extra mouth to feed, and this is all the more because her own cat now seems permanently encamped outside our door, begging for food (see album above). This winds Solomon up, and because he is a bit cowardly, he takes it out on Poppy.

Even if the neighbour would take him (Alfred) now, we would still face the problem of him coming back for food, and potentially chasing Poppy too.

d) Basically, I indulged the cats, and it's kinda come back to bite me, as they came to lead relatively independent lives. Mrs tmstms wanted a real companion cat, and after very extensive searching, Sophie was the one- she actually wanted to be with the humans. By Sod's law, she's also the one to have an untimely death.

e) At the moment, there is other stuff going on, in particular, a long-lasting but undiagnosed illness to a family member, so my laissez-faire approach to cat behaviour, combined with Alfred's insouciant personality, is not a good mix for how Mrs tmstms is coping. 

3) What is Alfred like?

http://imgur.com/a/GA3j7

Well- he is the epitome of a casual cat.

a) Really well socialised- he likes being picked up, and he is very friendly, but on his own terms. He never bites or scratches. He's fine with other cats and very outgoing with people.

b) He is active and a wanderer. We suspect he would find his feet, or rather paws anywhere.

c) He is a good mouser, which one might see as good or bad.

d) He was born in Yorkshire between York and Wetwang. We met his mum- it was an unplanned litter and the owners gave the kittens away. We literally drove past two boys knocking a 'Free kittens' sign in the verge.

e) He is athletic and quite able to look after himself with other cats. He's actually quite low-maintenance, but he does enjoy being stroked and stuff.

f) He's fully litter-trained but prefers to toilet outdoors. He's microchipped and neutered.

4) Alfexit- the deal.

Back in the day, I knew loads of people and was really well networked. But in more recent years, mainly because of our work, I have little time, meaning that I actually trust the community of /r/casualUK more than my real-life connections.

a) Basically, this is a cat I love very much, so I want him to have as good a life as possible. Fortunately, he does not seem too hard to please.

b) He needs access to the outside and preferably to somewhere green, but as explained, he is not unused to being kept in at night. A cat flap might be ideal.

I would have to anticipate that the first few days of him being somewhere new, when he would be supposed to be kept in, might be a pain, but otherwise he's no trouble.

c) Depending on your life and circumstances, I would be prepared to arrange deliveries of some of the foods he likes for the whole of his lifetime. As you can tell, I've given the cats an extensive choice of food, and some of his favourites are premium-grade products. 

d) Obviously he would come with the blankets he likes, and which he sleeps on; and I'd pay the cost of changing his microchip details. 

e) Although he's a bit calmer than when he was an adolescent, I do recognise he might get into scrapes, so I'm not asking that he's mollycoddled, just that he has a good quality life.

f) I can pretty well promise he will be casual; I can't promise if he will be loving.

g) I am genuinely trying to find a permanent rehome for him, because Mrs tmstms is so upset, but I suppose I should say that if it really doesn't work out, Alfexit is revocable.

h) obviously, if you are reading this and know someone, and they are someone you trust, I'd be happy with that also.

EDIT: I don't want to give hostages to fortune, but TWO separate kind redditors have come forward and I have taken the chronologically first of those offers. Alfred's new owner is someone who posts pictures of their cat to reddit, showing a good environment, so looks like he has indeed fallen on his paws.

679vpf,I once slapped my friend square in the chops with a mackerel. What has been your finest hour?,"It was brilliant. I grew up in a fishing town where it was quite common to find the odd fish on the roadside that had fallen off a truck on the way to market. One evening, my mate and I were on our way to the pub when I saw a fairly hefty mackerel lying in the gutter and some sort of weird autopilot kicked in.


Without even thinking, I bent over, grabbed the fish by the tail and **WHAPPAP** - properly slapped him about the face with it. The noise was cartoon-like and as he reeled back, I knew deep down that this was probably the apex of my life. Nothing that has happened since has quite compared to that euphoric moment.

My brother drives a minivan with warp-speed abilities, and like evey male member of my family has learn to navigate the winding and awesome roads of Wales at a pace that would make Captain Picard get wood.

They arrived in the manner to which we are accustomed (can be heard coming half a mile off, and upon arrival the smell of hot brakes greets us) and My brother's Missus steps out to greet my family for the first time.

Dad: Hi *bear hug*, Was the journey here nice?

She: I dont know: I had my eyes closed. Dammit, my fanny is REALLY sore.

Mum: *chokes on coffee*

Dad: *wets himself laughing*

Grandparents: *disapproving silence*

Brother: Erm, 'Fanny' means 'Bum' in the US guys.

Mum: Ahhhh. I seeee.

Dad: *gasping for breath* Oh. So... not what I was thinking then? Thought it was a bit early for that.

Thankfully there was toilet paper so I gave the seat a quick wipe down (I'm not a savage) and got down to business. It wasn't an especially big one but I guess I was gone for long enough for my mates to notice - when I meet back up with them 20 odd minutes later one of them asks where I went, so I told him straight up: ""just been to churn out some of East London's finest"".

Well, the way my mates reacted, they thought I was some kind of philistine because I had a poo in a nightclub - I don't get it personally, I needed to go so I went! One of them did confide in me that he's snuck out of the club to the casino next door to use their clean bathrooms in the past but he's a sly one.

635mjn,Our rules.,"/u/gazzaknight and myself made this sub as a bit of a Friday morning joke. We never thought it would take off the way it did but we're all loving the ride.  
 
However, it's occurred to me that the rules I made up on day 1 might be a little vague and open to interpretation so I've made some new ones and expanded on the old ones. I hope you agree with them but please let me know if you think any of them are shit, or if you want me to add in some new ones.

- Same goes for national shit throwing. I'm all for a bit of playful teasing with the French and the Germans but there have been a few comments I've seen crossing the line and bringing up the Holocaust and what have you. Again just have a think about what constitutes as casual or not.

- I think we have a tendency to be a little cliquey and it's hard for new comers to blend right in. I've also seen people saying ""No Yanks!!"" and what not which is not what I want to encourage. We're trying to advertise /r/casualUK as a shiny alternative to /r/unitedkingdom and so I want our cousins around the world to visit us and realise things aren't as bad as they're led to believe.

5zps2z,Losing weight in the absolute laziest way [guide],"Alright, you're a fat arse and want to lose weight fast to get beach body ready [triggered]. I got you fam. 

Buy 2 sets of these once:

http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-11l-klip-lock-storage-set-3pk

Buy 3 bags of these a month:
https://www.mygsn.co.uk/steam-cooked-chicken-fillets

And then every 2 days buy this:

3 x http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-japanese-style-stir-fry-sauce-175ml (Any of these. There's a big selection. Buy 3 different ones)

1 x http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-stir-fry--basics-700g

2 x http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/brown---wholegrain/sainsburys-brown-rice-250g



Method:

Divide the veg into the 6 containers equally. Divide the 2 packets of rice into the 6 containers equally. Put a chicken breast in each container. Put half a packet of sauce in each container. 

When you want to eat (3 times a day), unclip the lid but keep it resting on top and nuke for 4 minutes in the microwave. Boom, instant stir fry. 

Calories per day: 1270 calories

Protein per day: 93+ grams

Daily cost: £5.88 a day

If you're an adult male and you stick to this diet, expect at least 0.75KG of weight loss a week. 

This is not a sustainable diet long term, both due to price and due to its low calorie nature. It's good for shedding pounds fast if you're a legitimate fat bastard, and possibly as a last ditch effort to get abs if you're struggling to get rid of that last bit of fat.

5zj2tb,Wanking gone wrong," I was in my final year of Uni. It was a warm autumn day and i was alone in my room with sun light pouring through my open window. All was good in the world, and as a little personal treat, I decided to partake in a little bit of personal hand love.


Instead of a leisurely bed wank, instead I’d opt for the more professional desk wank, complete with swivel chair and pc. The event itself was none too remarkable; I coaxed one out to some lovely lass and given that it was a treat I decided to finish with a standing ovation, spurting my silky man fat onto the hard wooden floor under the desk. It felt good, and why wouldn't it?


About 30 seconds later there was knock at my bedroom door from one of my housemates and he immediately burst in. I had re assumed the sitting position at this point, and feeling relief that I hadn't been caught red handed and that there was no pron left on the computer screen, I instead focused on trying to cover the dying erection in my trousers, while at the same time trying to look nonchalant. I also partook in the obligatory eager and yet stilted conversation one does when trying to hide the fact that mere seconds ago i had been having an orgy of self love with nothing more that a fist and my trouser lizard.


""Mind if I grab a couple of the songs we downloaded last night?"" he said while at the same time brandishing a USB stick.


Before i could properly respond he was already down on his knees, by the side of me. This in itself was unnerving; given that he was now eye level with the aforementioned, diminished, but never the less still dangerous trouser lizard. Worse still was that there were no USB sockets on the front of the pc free, and before I could protest he said:


""I’ll just stick this in one of the others round the back""


I tried to say something but nothing came out. That's when it happend, with his little face looking back at me waiting for my reply, he leant further forward under the desk, put his hand down to steady himself and immediately froze. He'd twigged. We were locked in the death stare for no more than 5 seconds but in those 5 seconds a lot was processed by both of us. He was hoping what he'd just put his hand in, wasn't what he thought it was, but it was. Each of use continued to stare deep into the others soul's. His soul crying out and trying to comprehend how this could have happened, me trying to think of a plausible excuse for my filthy act of floor spunkage.


Amazingly, he broke the silence first, the pained look on his face disappeared and he continued on his mission, inserting the USB and copying the music from my desktop, all the while acting as if nothing had happened. I guess it was a knee jerk reaction to the hideousness of knowing my potential babies were currently trying to swim into the pours of his hand. He was trying to pretend it hadn't happened while it was still happening!


He finished, got up and left, leaving us both to digest/vomit over what had just happened.


It was disgusting, an unnatural moment shared by two close friends, and despite this, i swear, just as he left the room, i saw him bring his glistening palm to his hand and take a sniff. filthy bastard.

5w9ftw,[Post match thread] Going to the football with /u/Bell_Whiff,"Yesterday I was invited to go to the Watford match with /u/Bell_Whiff. It's just like tinder and not weird at all, he said. I thought why not, free football ticket, it'll be fine. 

Well, how wrong was I? Very.

We met at Canning Town to get the tube and he seemed normal enough, though the camouflage jacket didn't really go with the Watford FC jogging bottoms. It's the football though, people want to support their club, fine. We got on the train and were chatting away normally until I said something vaguely funny, and instead of laughing whiffers replied ""+1 upboat to you, sir!"" Alright, bit weird, but maybe he's forgotten we're in real life now.

We got off the tube at Euston to get the train to Watford and it got weirder. It started with someone trying to pass by him and politely saying excuse me. Immediately he produced a pen and paper and began writing ""From Whiffers with love"" to this woman. When she said she was just trying to get past he screamed at her ""DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO I AM?! BANNED!!!"" It was quite a scene. He tore up his signed note and threw it at her as she scarpered, poor woman.

We then get on the train, and I'm a bit wary at this point, but he'd brought a few tinnies (strongbow dark fruits - I should have just left immediately in hindsight) and we start talking normally. Obviously this couldn't last when an American also on his way to the game sat down opposite us.

The guy started talking to us about the game, but had to stop since Whiff was squirting dark fruits out of his mouth at the yank. Just repeatedly spraying fizzy alcohol pop at the bloke like a shitty squirtle. The guy was about to say what the fuck until whiffers started shouting ""Reeeeeeeee this is the UK I'm in charge here get out scrub!"" The poor yank ran off to the toilet and left me with the fizzy pop weirdo.

The strangest part came at the game, when we met with /u/robdeejay and whiffers turned completely normal. Like an actual, functioning human. It was bizarre, a façade of normality and honestly it was the creepiest part of the whole experience for me. The match itself wasn't great, hence being last on motd, but I enjoyed it. Decent chips.

We left /u/robdeejay and it was straight back to the upboats and do you know who I am? Whiffers. It turns out he has personalised user tags for everyone who has ever replied to a comment of his. They're all screenshotted on his phone. Worrying. 

We met up with my gf on the way back as I was staying at hers and he changed again, from the guy who was boasting about his karma (""I've got 100,000 in a month alone - who the fuck are you?"") to the ultimate stereotype. Out of nowhere he produced a fedora, tipped it, went to one knee and tried to kiss my girlfriend's hand. Weirded out she pulled her hand away, leading to poor Whiffers, tears in his eyes, saying ""M'lady..?"" as he backed away. He squirted the last of the dark fruits he'd been saving in his cheek like a weird alcoholic hamster at us, before turning and running away.

I just hope he got home safe. Cheers for the ticket.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/5w9ftw/post_match_thread_going_to_the_football_with/,1488102111.0,130,0.89,51,CasualUK,jptoc

dm4ct0,The Apprentice Week 4: Electric Bikes,"Good evening!

Last week we said goodbye to Souleyman (a little harshly, I think) after Tommy the Turtle didn't convince toymakers to invest in Team Unison. As an aside, calling the team Unison is guaranteed to end up ironic, isn't it?

Either way, Talking Tommy, voiced by Tommy FACKIN Skinner, didn't wow anyone, and Riyonn brought Souleyman back in for the chop. Not sure why, and I'm not sure how he didn't get the boot himself because he was a rather useless PM.

On the other team, Pam's MLP rip off combined with slime was only saved thanks to Iasha's quick thinking in the pitch, immediately winning us all over by saying a key skill of hers is ""winging it."" 

This week the contestants are doing something with electric bikes. Calling surlordalunsugar making a joke about ""just riding a bike"" in the boardroom now.

His most challenging programmes are those that end up helping you become a little less ignorant about the world we live in, sharing the humanity of people we might often distance ourselves from as a self-preserving measure.

Everyone loves Attenborough for extremely clear and justified reasons, but damn, Theroux has to be on his level in terms of how much of a national treasure he is.

dlvsv2,Has anyone had Coco Pops recently?,"I've loved Coco Pops my whole life, I've always been loyal to Coco Monkey too - never straying to own brand versions of his sacred cereal. I remember fondly when we were losing in the final of the Jungle World cup and Coco Monkey poured Coco Pops and milk into the trophy to galvanise his team's spirit. Crafty Croc and his team were winning 10-0 (great use of Rhinos as midfield enforcers) but Coco Monkey managed to win the game 11-10 in the end by using Coco Pops as a rallying cry to motivate his team. (It has been discussed since that this game actually made a mockery of the Jungle World Cup and that a team who were 10-0 down at half time really shouldn't have progressed to the final stages. Deploying Hippos as centre backs quickly went out of fashion after this televised game)

I stopped eating Coco Pops for a while when I reached my 30s, I was newly married and wanted to show my wife that I was the sort of modern gentleman who had kippers, percolated coffee and a copy of the FT at breakfast time. But this week I've been at home with a stinking cold and returned to my old pal Coco Monkey for sustenance for the first time in years. 

Friends, what has happened to Coco Pops? Where once they were a noble mountain of dusky choco goodness, now they are a slag heap of tasteless gruel. I can only assume that Crafty Croc has somehow interfered with the recipe (or that modern standards about how much sugar you can put in breakfast cereal have changed). Alas, one of British life's noblest aspects is no more. I'm off to the supermarket now to check if Sugar Puffs are still decent now that the Sugar Puffs Monster no longer plays in goal for Newcastle United.

diufte,The Apprentice Week Three: Toymakers,"Good evening.

Week three is already here, and joy abounds in our hearts as the teams get mixed up. Will we have the pleasure of seeing Ryan-Mark and Lottie on the same team..? But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Last week we said goodbye to dearest Kenna, who seemed altogether too nice (and too stupid) to win this competition. Kenna, who wanted to go into the ice cream business with surlordalunsugar, put himself forward as the PM for an ice cream task. The team then contrived to fuck up so badly a team which put whole sprigs of rosemary in the fucking ice lollies won.

*How* did they fuck up that badly? Just how? Based on his current shite-ness I think Dean needs to pull his socks up or he'll be out by his ear in no time.

This week the teams are mixed up and sent to make some toys for children. Since several of the contestants are still literal children, this should be a walk in the park, right? 

Favourites so far? I think Souleyman has been decent, albeit quite quiet.

The contestants:

I occasionally have to go to London for meetings. It usually consists of a train to paddington, a number of tubes, pop up in central london, then do the journey in reverse. When I get home and blow my nose, it's always some dirty grey/black colour.

I've been to Torronto, Tokyo, Barcelona, Madrid and even Marrakesh (which rekindled my asthma) but none of these places leave my mucus with black and grey blotches. Anyone else know what I'm talking about?

Also, if it is the case that this happens, do you guys who live in London just accept it as part of the London tax?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/dis88i/does_anyone_else_get_black_shit_in_their_nose/,1571245280.0,71,0.96,64,CasualUK,troopski

Why do British people tend to be so polite and indirect in social situations? 

I guess there’s two sides to this. From where I come from, being straightforward is seen as a virtue. You speak what’s on your mind, you say what you need to say directly. Of course, this might result in people being blunt. 

In the UK, I saw a lot of locals use euphemisms and “beat around the bush” when they ask for something. Also, everyone is super polite and just all around friendly, and I’m afraid I might come across rude when I plainly tell someone I don’t like what they’re proposing for example. 

Can you guys educate me on this a bit? I’m open to all sorts of comments: the origin of these social norms, why it’s so different from the rest of Europe, why you’re so big on not offending anyone, and whether people like me have a place in British society even if we don’t conform to British social etiquette.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/dio6sj/why_are_brits_so_polite/,1571226627.0,53,0.93,98,CasualUK,thefirstofhisname11

Not so long ago she lost her bag and laptop on a train, with the purse too. That too was returned with everything present a week later.

dfwkne,"UK, I ate the brown meat. [Update]","I'm sure you're all wanting to know if I died, shat myself, vomited out of my eyes: Well dear reader, read on...  

The meat seemed sealed in the plastic container, but as many of you said the brown-ness is a sign of it being exposed to air. I unpackaged it and disposed of the juice collecting meat nappy. I was warned not to eat it if it smelled vinegary or had a waxy appearance. *It had both.*  

I know, I know. I shouldn't have, but I thought ""What's the worst that can happen?""  

One commenter suggested that if I cooked the meat thoroughly I'd be fine. So with that in mind I popped a little olive oil in to a tall pan, squished the brown meat between my fingers to break it in to chunks, and popped it in the pan.  

The smell grew worse as the mixture of hot oil and steam allowed it's pungent aroma to fill my nostrils.  I persevered, popping the pan lid on to ""seal in the flavour"".  

After 5 or so minutes on high heat, I removed the lid to see how it was cooking. It was still brown. Maybe it was cooked, maybe it was not. There was no way of telling.  

I pushed on, adding garlic, onions, tomato paste, jalapenos, a squeeze of lemon juice and some cream cheese. I stirred, seasoned with salt and black pepper and popped the lid back on. I turned down the heat and left it for a further 15-20 minutes, occasionally stirring to avoid it sticking to the bottom of the pan. The sauce thickened, possibly a little too much, and then came the time to try it.  

Dunking a teaspoon in to the red-ish sauce, I brought it up to my nose. No foul scent. Good. A few blows on the teaspoon and I slurped it in to my mouth. It was too hot to taste. I gulped it down and tried again. This time blowing for at least 30 seconds. I held the sauce in my mouth for a few seconds, letting the saltiness roll around my tongue, then came the sweetness of the tomatoes and the warmth of the black pepper.  

It was... OK.

I decided to press on and try some meat. Double dipping the teaspoon (don't worry, I live alone), I tried to fish out a slither of brown meat. I lifted it up to my face and inspected it closely. No smell. No waxiness. Hmm, do I?  

I did. Popped it in my mouth and took a few slow chews.  

It was... OK.

I waited a few minutes to see if there was an instant reaction after eating this small morsel of meat. Anticipating scenes from Guest House Paradiso. Nothing happened. I pressed on.  

Ditching the teaspoon in the sink, I picked up a larger spoon and set to work straining the meat from the sauce as I transferred it to my bowl. I then poured the correct amount of sauce over the meat and retired to the living room to indulge in my poisonous dinner treat.  

It tasted... OK.

The meat was a little chewy, possibly due to the over cooking, but the smell was gone. As was the waxiness.  

**Now to the good part.**  

Around an hour later I felt the urge to use the bathroom. Climbing the stairs, my stomach grumbled a little.  

Reaching the porcelain throne, I sat down and... it was just a pee and a fart. Disappointment.  

Ah well, back down stairs for more TV. I went to bed a few hours later and slept quite well, besides some wildly erotic dreams. Maybe these can be attributed to the meat, maybe not.  

The next morning, I awoke in bed. I felt a weight pushing down on my lower abdomen. It was time. I got up and immediately felt my insides shift. Off to the throne once more. Sitting on the cold seat, in a cold bathroom, on a cold morning. I pooped. Just a normal poop. No firmer or softer than previous poops. Disappointment.   

And that's it. I didn't poop myself, vomit out of my eyes, or anything nasty.  

Here is the offending meat in it's cooked form: https://imgur.com/a/ISZL5yw

Now, there is still half a pan sitting in my fridge.  

**Do I go for round two, heat it up and have it for tea tonight?**

dfm3pv,The Apprentice Week Two: Ice Cream,"Welcome back to the Apprentice live threads, set to have more drama than Christmas this year when the Vardys invite the Rooneys over.

Last week they all went to South Africa and the boys fucked it because they didn't fill out their tour, even though their tour was far better. Somehow, none of the girls guests asked for a refund. How the actual fuck that happened when a tour of a vineyard including the wine cellar *couldn't find the fucking wine cellar* is beyond me.

Needless to say, there were tantrums and accusations flying amongst the girls in the board room, accompanied by smug looks from the boys before they found out they'd lost.

The prize last week? They got to see the house first. How shit is that?

I can't remember who the PM was for the girls team, but they were wank either way.

This week they're making ice cream, and if Kenny Ngoma doesn't PM it he should be fired on the spot.

dfl3wy,Postman Pat is a drain on Royal Mail,"After watching a few episodes of Postman Pat the past few days I think he may be the sole reason for Royal Mail is in the state that its in, nevermind mismanagement or electronic communications taking over.

I've got no idea how anyone can keep a job for 35 years while being so incompetent. I'm surprised he made it past his probationary period with his ability to totally fuck up even the simplest of tasks on a daily basis. 

In the first one I watched recently he had some eggs to deliver to the school because they were about to hatch (I'll overlook the lack of an incubator for the eggs and the doubt I have that Pat has a licence for transporting livestock). Anyway Jess does a runner (more on Jess later), so Pat decides to to put the eggs down for a minute to give chase. Where does Greendale's favourite postman put them? On a convinent stall that is selling fucking eggs! And of course these eggs get sold to some innocent passerby hungry for his bacon and eggs, with no clue about the small chickens inside. Pat has to spend a whole fucking day trying to find who purchased the eggs like some kind of Agathe Cristie thriller/mystery 
! If he just kept a hold of them for the 10 seconds it took to find the fleabag or put them down literally anywhere else in the world, the whole delivery job would have taken him 5 minuted max given the size of the village. Realistically since there are only a handful of people who love there anyway it couldn't have been that hard to track down the accidental parcel stealer, he's just milking every tiny setback so he can continue to do fuck all like he's used to. 

Another blatant display of his incompetence was an episode where he had to deliver a film canister. Patrick goes to the Greendale depot and takes out a massive van, for this microscopic parcel! He has a moped, I wouldn't that be a much more sensible option for this delivery? 

Speaking of his massive van, looking on Wikipedia he now has eight different post delivery vehicles! Eight vehicles for a tiny village, I said that Pat was Greendale's favourite postman before, but you have to understand this was in jest because he's the only one. If they had the choice between Harold Shipman and Pat Clifton I'm not sure which one I'd chose to be honest! How can Royal Mail justify eight different vehicles for a village with a single postman? He can only drive a one at a time! Each one also has a personal number plate, I refuse to belive this is an acceptable expenditure. I can only image that Greendale Post Office is in some kind of budget black hole where they've gave them a huge pile of money by accident and whoever oversees the budget decided to try and spend it all before anyone higher up noticed. 

Note that I didn't say he had 8 cars or vans, it's 8 vehicles. The evidence that they've tried to spend as much as possible is in the fact that one of the options Pat has to deliver the post is a bloody helicopter! How many small villages have helipads? I've got no idea how a whirlybird would ever be appropriate to transport a single parcel less than a mile, but I digress. Surely if the very specific circumstances ever popped up that the most appropriate vessel was a chopper being the best option for delivery, chartering one every blue moon would be far cheaper than buying a whole helicopter for one villages Post Office. I'm not sure of they put Pat through his Pilots licence on the off chance that he'd have to fly one day, or if it's a hobby of his. One day he's going to die in a mangled fireball of a helicopter crash taking Ted with him. 

And it's unhygienic and dangerous to have Jess in his van all day. Not only for the fact that one of the people on his route could be allergic to animal hair but the amount of time Jess escapes I'm surprised she's not ended up under the wheels of one of Pat's eight vehicles. And I've never saw Jesse's litter tray. All his vans must be filled with cat shit. 

With the size of the village I'm surprised he even gets a uniform, I'm sure he'd be able to finish his rounds in less than 10 minutes if he didn't balls things up so often or get distracted helping the kids in the school with their science projects. Which I'm sure he never clocks out for. My tax money paying a postman a full time wage to help a farmer's tractor get out of a ditch? How is that fair. 

He's now in the Special Delivery Service part of the Post Office which I'm sure costs a fuck ton to useand guarantees delivery at a certain time. I wouldn't be happy if my kidney got here 3 days late because Pat was busy cleaning his cats ares after it fell in a muddy puddle. I have no idea how the villagers receive their bills and stuff since he's the only postman they've got and he's 'busy' messing around trying to deliver all these parcels that take hours to get anywhere. 

Budget concerns, unable to perform his job with an ounce of competency, wasting time on the job? Patrick Clifton, you have made an enemy out of me, and I think I'll use UPS if I ever have to deliver anything to the little village of Greendale as I can't trust you with delivering a leaflet, never mind getting the pills Mrs Goggins has to order from the dark Web because the NHS have closed the local doctors surgery.

Edit: OK time to be a massive hypocritical bastard (becuase I'm not a fan of when other people do this) and say thanks to everyone for the awards and anyone who chipped in with lovely comments about how this gave you a chuckle, or brightened your day.

I can understand it at busier stations where it means you’d get on the train first, but the station I commute from is reasonably quiet and the trains are reasonably empty, so standing over the line makes absolutely zero difference to anything other than that they’re stood right next to the track while trains fly past.

It seems like an unnecessary increase in risk for absolutely no reward at all, but there are *always* people defiantly standing over the line even after being yelled at by staff to get back. Once I even saw a guy just step one foot back (leaving the other leg stretched out over the line) just so he could remain cool and over the line. These are grown men in suits on their way to their big boy jobs in the city, so I’m dumbfounded at how incredibly childish they are at *insisting* on being over that line. Maybe they think they’re better than everyone else? Maybe it’s the only thing they have any control over in their lives? Either way it’s daft.

Anyway that’s my rant and my justification, now for the satisfying bit: Yesterday the staff yelled at them all to get back behind the line and like usual they all stood their ground like defiant children, and the train that passed was a freight train with one of the carriages spraying water out the side with just enough force to soak only the people over the line.

It was quite fun to watch them all look around confused and angry at how this could have happened *to them*.

Tl;dr idiots refusing to step back behind the line got covered in water for doing so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/dey717/watched_a_bunch_of_people_get_their_karma_for/,1570531251.0,455,0.96,60,CasualUK,MrBran4

dewoiu,Just a quick casual reminder that there are a select few vehicles being targeted by thieves across the UK right now and you need to be vigilant.,"A good friend of mine has just had his BMW M240i stolen and I know these as well as Mercedes AMG and Audi RS cars are also being targeted by these gangs and groups. 

Nothing clever or any 'hacking' going on here, it was a simple case of smashing in his window and taking the keys while he was in bed. They were in and out in a matter of seconds and he got out the front door just in time to see his car speed off. 

Last month I attended a wedding where the groom came out in the morning to find his brand new Audi RS4 had gone missing. CCTV showed a guy in a mask walk straight in to an unmanned reception, get his room key and go get the keys while they were all partying away in the function room. 

Both occasions were in very quiet, countryside locations. 

Being the driver of one of these types of cars I have taken the following measures to avoid this happening and would advise anyone with  **any car** to do the same. 


* Steering wheel lock (very cost effective and a great deterrent. Just keep the key separate from your car key or buy a coded one)

* Lock box in the house for your keys (hide it inside a cupboard if needs be)

* Security pole on your driveway (only applicable if you have a private driveway, more cost involved)

* Security cameras with motion alert (obviously the most expensive but a great deterrent. However your phone can wake you because of a passing cat)

* GPS tracker installed in your car, with accompanying stickers on the windows

Now, I understand nothing is foolproof but anything you can do to make any potential thieves think twice will always help. 

And most importantly, keep yourselves safe!

Edit: In response to all the comments saying the deterrents will just cause the thieves to assault the owner, this is not the case with these thefts. This question was posed to the police in my area who stated that there are zero reports of violence in these thefts and nobody has entered the upstairs of the houses. They are purely opportunity driven and involve the thieves looking for the easy targets. They know full well that any extra things they have to do will lead to an increased chance of them getting caught.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/dewoiu/just_a_quick_casual_reminder_that_there_are_a/,1570519829.0,63,0.92,73,CasualUK,26326312

delzm5,"Yeah please go ahead, oh fuck.","So i was doing some shopping in a well known supermarket that apparently mums all over the UK love. I had a pretty full trolley, stacked to the brim with my two weeks shoping. I get to the tills and of course there is only have one till on. A little old lady who got to the tills just as i did only had a basket with like three things in. So i say ""go on, go ahead its fine"", she goes ahead. Just as i begin to manoeuvre my full trolly to the till another little old man appears just behind me, again with a basket with maybe two things in, so again i say ""do you want to get infront sir, ive got loads here"" he says  ""oh very kind of you you young man, thank you"". Then surely enough a small queue of three maybe four old people starts to form behind me, each with three or four items. So not wanting to look the dick to all of these OAPs i let them all get ahead of me one by one. At this stage im pissed off but i cant show that of course, it wouldnt be british if i did.

ddm08u,I've just been a brave girl and had a flu jab!!,"I didn't get a sticker though...

I've always had all my jabs, but I had a bad reaction to a flu one a few years ago. 

(I didn't suddenly become autistic or anything, it just triggered a neurological condition I have for a few hours. It's the only one vaccine ever in 43 years that has done that and I've had a lot of vaccinations, including all the travel ones).

So today was the first day since then that I've overcome the anxiety enough to go alone and drive myself there and back too. I even talked a very nervous man who hates injections through having his!

I feel so proud of myself! 

I nearly backed out. Then I thought of the NHS nurses working on a Saturday to keep us safe, the people I come into contact with who really can't afford to get flu and how miserable flu is to get. 

It's not very casual but I hope this post encourages other nervous people who are entitled to a free jab to go. This year's one is really good.

-

**[Dean Ahmad](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7n/ww/p07nww84.jpg/624)**

*He says:* “I’ve definitely got the gift of the gab, I can persuade anyone to do anything.”

*We say:* You can definitely convince us to kick you out Week One, Deano.

**[Scarlett Allen-Horton](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2m/p07p2m9s.jpg/624)**

*She says:* “I am an achiever. I have been the highest performer across every workplace I have worked within.”

*We say:* Easy to do when everyone else is a coked up, alcoholic recruiter, Scarlett.

**[Jemelin Artigas](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2m/p07p2mgw.jpg/624)**

*She says:* “I never have problems, I only have solutions.”

*We say:* Going to be honest with you here Jem, a solution is pretty fucking useless unless you are presented with a problem.

**[Souleyman Bah](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2m/p07p2mss.jpg/624)**

*He says:* “The less sight I have, the more imagination I gain, because what you see is what you see and what you don’t see is when the magic begins.”

*We say:* Stick the prick in a dark room and give him a magic wand. Fuck off, Sully.

**[Lewis Ellis](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2m/p07p2mxz.jpg/624)**

*He says:* “I may not be the smartest guy in the room, but I’ll sure as hell work harder.”

*We say:* You work hard over there with the crayons and the colouring book, okay Lewis?

**[Lubna Farhan](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2n/p07p2n74.jpg/624)**

*She says:* “I came from a council estate… I have made myself into something good and I’m on my way to becoming something great”.

*We say:* Just because you're from a council estate doesn't mean you have to write bars, Lubna. Fair fucks though, she actually seems competent on first glance.

**[Riyonn Farsad](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2n/p07p2nn6.jpg/624)**

*He says:* “I will use my poker face and tactics to always come out on top.”

*We say:* He means ""I will stare gormlessly and remember what I should have done in the task in the taxi on the way home after week one."" Ri-gone.

**[Shahin Hassan](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2p/p07p2p54.jpg/624)**

*He says:* “I love business more than sharks love blood… I’m ruthless in my pursuit of success.”

*We say:* Honestly, where to start? This guy seems like an automa-twat who's there to say they include techy people, but they've chosen the twattiest one. Lord above.

**[Pamela Laird](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2p/p07p2pgd.jpg/624)**

*She says:* “I love to be the under-estimated person in the room.”

*We say:* She'll sneak through despite not saying a word until week 5 when surlordalunshugga will mention it in the boardroom and kick her out for it.

**[Carina Lepore](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2q/p07p2q0n.jpg/624)**

*She says:* “I’m about 5 foot 1 inch tall - I’m like a pocket rocket, you don’t really want to mess with me.”

*We say:* I can hold you at arms length while you try to swing, go for it Carina. Muppet.

**[Lottie Lion](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/images/width/live/p0/7p/2q/p07p2qfv.jpg/624)**

*We say:* Ryan-Mark Parsons was put on this earth to annoy me. The hyphen is in the wrong place, his face looks like he's just smelt his own fart and knows it's worth more than anything you own, he invented a job as a luxury womenswear consultant so he can touch up women and claim it's work and even when he fails he can run back to mummy and daddy, guaranteed.

My dad is Deaf and is a sign language user so while the hospital have been good at getting interpreters, they can only be there an hour or so a day so I have to be there all the time so they can communicate. But it's getting beyond that stage now, as he's rarely awake and can't understand anyone but me. 

I'm pretty tired.

Edit to update: I'm back at the hospital now. He's been awake and talking this morning, and eaten breakfast. It was nice to get to have a little chat with him. He's struggling to breathe now because of an the fluid on his lungs, and possibly an infection. The doctors come and go but by request he's not being treated.

d9grj6,A bullshitarian's guide to veggie sausage rolls,"So, I'm a dirty bastard who wants to eat slightly less meat but has zero interest in not being a dirty bastard.  

I saw a comment thread a while ago on here comparing some vegan sausage rolls and realised that my time to shine had come.  I could attempt to eat *all* the pies (or in this case, veggie sausage rolls) and provide a 10 word review of them to you gentlemen, so you don't have to.  

So without further ado here begins the first volume  of a labour of love.  I invite recommendations of what I should try next.  

*Greggs vegan sausage roll:*
 
Pros: tasty, warm, reasonably priced.

Cons: none really

Verdict: solid


*Morrisons veggie sausage rolls*

Pros: comes in a pack of two

Cons: tastes like eating sage and onion stuffing

Verdict: I don't like sage and onion stuffing


*Quorn sausage roll found in Tesco's*

Pros: probably as tasty as the Greggs ones

Cons: cost more than the Greggs ones.  Not vegan.  

Verdict: solid


*Tesco's cheese and beans roll*

Pros: Dirty, come in a multipack

Cons: obvs not proper vegan

Verdict: These definitely appeal.  


*Ginsters morrocon veg pasty*

Pros: proper vegan

Cons: Only sausage roll adjacent.  Bland.  

Verdict: There's a reason ""proper vegan"" was the only pro I came up with

*Generic cheese and onion rolls*

Pros:. Multipack.  Sold literally everywhere.

Cons: like cheese and bean rolls but not as good

Verdict: ok.


*Home made mushroom roll*

Pros: delicious, can be served with a pint

Cons: found (so far) only in a pub in Cambridge, 3 hours travel from my home.  Other sources may vary.

Verdict: delicious


*University halls of residence vegan sausages*

Pros: I've not been a student for decades so eating these was a one off

Cons:  Literally everything. 

Verdict:. Like someone took bubble and squeak, made it shitter and formed it into sausage shape.

lwp7rc,"I, for one, am going to miss the feck out of lockdown.","I have enjoyed the extra hour and a half each weekday morning. I have enjoyed the quieter roads. I have enjoyed the distance we observed between people (maybe just me on that one). I've enjoyed the slower pace of living that's been forced on us. I've spoken more to my friends about more personal things than before. I've enjoyed the morning dog walks and chats with others walking. I have, no lie, enjoyed the increased time I've had with my rapidly growing up children. I'm not blind to the hardships that many of us have suffered (increased rates of domestic violence for one) and there are things that aren't so great - we all can think of examples - but I've been pleasantly surprised by the truth that it's not things that bring happiness but people. Mostly.

Edit: I feel I need to qualify this post. I am not suggesting this had been the greatest thing since life crawled out of the ocean. It's been unbelievably dire for many,  many people. There have been many deaths directly related to the lockdown and not due to covid-19. People aren't seeing their families and/or loved ones. This is a tragedy. I'm trying to articulate the positives I've drawn from lockdown, in spite of it. I'm not diminishing or glorifying anyone's experience. It's the few things I've listed which I feel are positive *for me* and I think are likely going to be lost as our society returns to, for want of a better word,  normal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/lwp7rc/i_for_one_am_going_to_miss_the_feck_out_of/,1614761110.0,438,0.85,170,CasualUK,LittleEngland

OK, it's a bit ""farmery"".  It's been used off road. A lot. It stinks horribly, is covered in mud inside and out, there are some really grim mouldy stains in the boot where I think something died and has decomposed. Some of the door handles are missing on the outside and you have to reach into holes the bodywork to open the doors.

d5cxaz,I'm an American who visited just recently. I want to know- y'all really out here eating potato waffles and beans?,"My friend in the UK asked if I wanted a potato waffle. She got all excited about them and asked her mom if there were any, like this is a staple snack. 

I didn't even know what they were. I still don't know because my mind couldn't comprehend the cosmic horror that was the final plating. I describe them as a French fry waffle.

She puts them in the toaster and microwaves baked beans in a fancy looking container. The beans are placed on top of 


 **Potato Waffle.**

Then- a truly astonishing move; she grates cheese on top of this potatopia.

I was very excited to get a *taste*. Before I did, I needed to send  picture to my friends overseas. They got back to me quickly. 

""What is that monstrosity?""

""That is an abomination.""

They were right, this wasn't something that the laws of nature had intended.  I carried on and proceeded to eat the potato waffle, doing my best to get past the cheese which I don't like in general. 

It was okay. But it ain't normal. It ain't right. 


This was one of many eye opening experiences on my visit. Thank you.


Edit: Sometimes cheese can be cool, like on pizza and sandwiches and all that, but I can't do hardcore or just straight up cheese.

Its a free service through your library, just put in your library card number.(Some libraries might not be members but most in the uk are).

You can stream 10 films every month and they have mainstream films, indie films, documentaries, kids films, and films to help with courses such as sciences, languages, business, etc.

I'm going to watch a film on it this afternoon and thought others might not know about it.Difficult to find interesting films to stream legally, youtube has some, and many people don't have paid services such as Netflix, amazon prime, etc, I don't myself.

No problem. They put a card in their letterbox and we think nothing more of it.  
That evening, nobody shows up, meh could be working late.  
After a couple days of no pickup my wife wanders up and knocks on the door, no answer. And again a few days later. And again a few days after that.

d1xrix,Every day I walk past a particular house on my way to Sainsbury’s in my lunch break...,"We’ve all seen a house like it. They’ve seemingly never heard of the rubbish tip so they just abandon all their unwanted crap on their driveway and leave it there. Sofas, mattresses, kids’ old toys, whatever. Well this particular house has had an old tennis net stood on the driveway for months, with the poles together and the net wrapped around them. As I walked past them today I noticed a hedgehog at the base. I took a closer look as it is unusual to see a hedgehog in the middle of the day, and I’m glad I did as he was completely tangled in the net. He had obviously been there for some time after struggling for god knows how long and apparently giving up (or getting so knotted he couldn’t move anymore). After asking a couple of passers by if they may happen to have anything I could cut him free with (nail scissors maybe, I don’t know, turns out they had nothing) I had to knock on the homeowner’s door and tell him what had happened. He brought out some scissors and we cut the bulk of the net off.  I took the [hedgehog](https://imgur.com/gallery/2zA8kfI) to the nearest vet, who spent 15 minutes untangling him and advised that I return him to the same place (although away from the net). I did so (hiding him under a nearby hedge) and can only hope that he’s ok, and that the owner of that tennis net has had the decency to remove it completely. 
We see all sorts of photos, mainly from the ocean, where animals are tangled in plastic beer can holders or have straws up their noses or god knows what. But it’s not often we see examples of this on our own doorstep. I don’t even live in the countryside, I was in the middle of a busy town in the south east. 
I’m sorry to have gone all preachy, it wasn’t my intention when I started writing this post, but it definitely got to me seeing that today.

In my old house we were protected by a ring of tube spiders.  It was a handy arrangement, they didn’t come in and in turn got to eat anything that tried to.  

Now though, we don’t have that.  They don’t live here and being a new build there’s all manner of ways in due to movement etc.  

This morning I was letting the dog out of his crate when a spider bro made his appearance.  The hound didn’t want to know so I had deploy a pint glass to trap it.  I’m pretty sure it made cut throat gestures as I carried it to the garden. I did take a pic, but decided people really don’t want to see that when they open their screen.

Shortly afterwards, an A Road comes into the pub. Again the motorway points and says “Here, you, piss off out of my pub”. The A road looks scared and rushes out.

A little while later, a little weedy road comes in, all skinny and pink. The motorway says nothing. His mate, who’s been watching all this, pokes the motorway, and says, “What’s going on? Are you not going to tell this guy where to go?”.  “Are you kidding?” replies the motorway, “That guy’s a Cycle Path”.

cvh3oa,My 0140 hours stealth snack just went wrong..,"Wife’s asleep, I awoke to a craving of a laughing cow or dairylea triangles.. I knew the wife bought some for some convoluted meal. 

Something insane that no married man could fathom.. like cheese triangles on a cracker..

Insanity..

So down I go, using the light on my phone to guide the way like some half arsed orc bane to the chamber of cool beers and Tesco own brand ham slices that have to be gobbled on sight, which of course one is promptly consumed.

After much shuffling through the fridge I discover the treasure that would quench my desire for soft cheese triangles, she did buy laughing cow! There is however only one left.. what did we eat that could use soft cheese?.

I take the last one from the box but I cant unwrap it using one hand so I place my phone atop the microwave with the light shining down and proceed to unwrap the delight beneath it.

My phone then with no regard for its safety leaps forth towards the snack to delve deep within its surface. This in turn strikes the wrapping and contents from my hands downwards onto the floor.

The once edible soft cheese was now sandwiched between the floor and a phone which still had its light shining, straight up at me, taunting me, it would probably laugh at me if it was able.

I am now without, I take another ham slice and close the fridge. I must hunt for the light switch as I have a mess to clean up.

RIP soft cheese, I’ll probably have to go get more tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/cvh3oa/my_0140_hours_stealth_snack_just_went_wrong/,1566781540.0,89,0.93,14,CasualUK,AncientProduce

cubrt8,whats the funniest outcome of language barrier you have ever witnessed?,"This happened years ago, but i still piss myself when i think about it.


My Grandparents had a very friendly Polish family move in next door to them, They would often say a brief Hello over the garden walls.

One afternoon Grandad went out the back to the garages and noticed said familys wheelie bin was still full to the rim. He peeked over the garden wall and began explaining to the Dad that although everyone on the street keeps their bins out the back, On collection day you have to take them round the front to the main road or else they wont get emptied.


*Polish Dad looks at my Grandad with a vacent stare for about 20 seconds, then starts happily nodding and abruptly walks off*


10 minutes later he returns and hands my Grandad a spanner....


He went in his house and pretended to fix something cause he didnt have the heart to tell the poor guy the truth.


As i said, this happened YEARS AGO but my Grandad brings this up alot cause it gives him a good chuckle",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/cubrt8/whats_the_funniest_outcome_of_language_barrier/,1566554519.0,65,0.98,68,CasualUK,cactusdan94

cuap1o,CasualUK does: Taskmaster!,"Good morning! 

In the last week or so we've bandied around the idea of ~~making you all do stupid shit for our entertainment~~ running our very own version of Taskmaster on CasualUK! Now, I can assure you that there's been at least 5 minutes of thought go into this, so please do have a quick read of the below and let us know if it's something that you'd be interested in.

If you've not seen Taskmaster, it's a programme whereby five hapless comedians/celebrities are forced to perform tasks for Greg Davies' amusement. [Here is a playlist of Series 4 tasks to whet your appetite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wOFaFLYgQ&amp;list=PLyk_nLKHU9QngEyhYCAR4VTRXlxm_LS-V)

**First things first, our rules**

* No task will force a participant to buy something.

* No task will require a participant to remove their anonymity (no videos/pictures of themselves).


Now, that second rule is quite limiting on the tasks that are going to be feasible, so I have created [**this strawpoll**](https://strawpoll.com/he6wdz43) that I would appreciate you filling out. We will not include tasks that remove anonymity unless there is a majority of 70% or more. Please, no comments on polls and their percentages.

**Some example tasks**

* Show us your most British item (nice and easy, just use Imgur)

* Depict a famous celebrity using only household items

* Eat a whole VW Golf including the tyres

**The Format**

- Week One: The **first task** is given on a Friday (30th August) and then a **Submissions Thread** is posted on Saturday 31st August, giving you 24 hours to prepare. The Submissions Thread will remain active until the following Thursday.

- Week Two: The **second task** will be announced, and week one submissions will be put into a straw poll to be voted on by subscribers. A **Submissions/Results Thread** will then be posted on Saturday for  subscribers to post their entries for Week Two, and for the results of Week One to be made publicly available.

- Week Three: follows the same format as above.

- The Top 10/20 users in the strawpoll results (dependent on entries) will be reverse scored (10 points for finishing top, 9 for second etc.). 

- In order to be in with a shout of winning the yet to be decided/announced prize (along with pride), entrants will have to take part in **at least five** tasks. Entrants and results will be tracked on an Excel sheet.

**Your thoughts**

- Firstly, does this sound like something you would be interested in participating in?

- Secondly, if you have thoughts on tasks/the format, please message us mods and put ""Taskmaster"" in the title of your message.

- [Please do fill out the strawpoll!](https://strawpoll.com/he6wdz43)

Edit: as has been suggested (and I forgot to mention) there will be mod discretion to chuck extra points to the ones we think are best/funniest and arbitrarily deduct points. Because why not? Not constantly though, that would mean theres little point to people going to any effort, but you get the gist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/cuap1o/casualuk_does_taskmaster/,1566546637.0,145,0.97,63,CasualUK,jptoc

Finally I'll be able to go home and not have to think about work, at least not in the same panic attack inducing way.  Getting a decent payrise and will be in a more senior position, which I've worked so hard for for at least 2 years now.

I called one in Northern Ireland, and holy hell, that man wanted nothing to do with any of my shenanigans. After a few sentences, he hung up on me, which I understand.
 
I called one in Scotland, and the man was so pleasant and we talked for about a minute, and I kind of wish I could have kept talking to him just for fun. 


I understand it may seem a bit unprofessional to call them while working, but I'm very bored and haven't talked to that many people outside of the US. I think there should be a subreddit for people who would like to talk to other folks from around the world. If we're being honest, who wants to talk to Americans, though.

cpegx5,I never thought that I’d ever have to seriously explain to someone why a railway line is not a public footpath. Today was the day...,"Homeward bound, driving a train on the last bit of my job back to the station where I’m based; there have been a few irritating little niggles but generally all is well with the world. 

We stop at a station, and whilst we’re there, the cab radio rings - the signalman wants to talk to me. He’s had a report of trespassers from a driver coming the other way, tells me where they were seen, cautions me through the affected section and asks me to tell him if I see anyone. Relatively normal stuff, especially for the school holidays - usually it’ll be someone taking a shortcut that they know they shouldn’t, and they’ll be long gone by the time the next train gets there.

I trundle round under the bridge that was given as the location. Nothing to be seen, but a few minutes have passed so I keep at caution for a little while longer just in case they’ve moved on. Suddenly, under a footbridge further on, there they are! I sound the horn, they look around and quickly disappear from view. Unexpectedly, as I get closer, they come back into view, standing on the alignment of what used to be another line parallel to mine. It’s an 80mph line, by the way, and normally we’d be getting up to that sort of speed by now.

Naturally, I stop, to challenge them and work out what to do next. I ask them what they’re doing, and one replies “walking home, innit”. I point out the obvious, that it’s a railway line, that they shouldn’t be there and that I’d very much appreciate it if they’d clear off. “Nah mate, it’s a public footpath this, I walk this way home every day.” No, it’s not a public footpath, it’s a railway, you’re trespassing and the police will almost certainly be involved now. “Nah, it’s a public footpath. Why else would they put a bridge across?!”. I suggest that perhaps the footbridge is to allow people to walk from one side of the railway to the other, but he disagrees - it’s definitely so that they can climb over the fence, scramble down the bank and use that rough area next to the running line to walk to work. I tell him again to clear off and not to come back onto the railway again. “How else can I get home? I do it every day!”, as he and his mate disappear up the bank and over the footbridge, clutching their tins of something vaguely resembling beer.

Without warning, the zookeeper propped up a large ladder, grabbed a penguin out of nowhere, went up the ladder whilst holding the penguin and hurled it over the fence. There were gasps all around and I wasn’t really sure what was going to happen next. But, as suspected, the lion ran over, took the wrapper off and ate it.

cnjlws,I'm an American starting my first job in the UK...,"I was just informed that my holiday that I'm taking at the end of the month is going to be paid?? What the hell? Apparently I'm entitled to up to six weeks holiday, how am I supposed to find time to use all of this? In my previous jobs I only took off two weeks a year, and that was unpaid. I'm honestly shocked. I had a few weeks that I'll need off in the next few months, which I already informed my boss about. I assumed that I'd just be taken off of the rota for that time and not paid. I almost feel guilty now that I know I'll be paid.

&amp;#x200B;

God, I love this country. I might try a sausage roll tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Actually, I'm going to use all this attention to ask a legitimate question. I'm contracted for 8 hours per week. It says my holiday entitlement is 6 weeks pro-rated. Is this 6 weeks based off of my 8 hour contract, or 6 weeks pro-rated down from 40 to whatever I end up working? Because my manager was telling me that it's 6 weeks even as part-time, which isn't at all what I thought was the case.

Follow-up edit:

Wow!! I've made /r/popular, best day of my life.

For the many people who are wondering, I'm a law student here. That's how I've managed to get here and that's why I'm allowed to work. Americans can use US federal (FAFSA) loans to pay for their education here, just like in America. You can use Sallie Mae too if you hate yourself. Studying here (at any level) makes it so that employers are not required to jump through the usual hoops required for hiring foreigners during or after your studies, making studying a viable route to residence and eventual citizenship in the UK, provided you can find work after your studies. It's a lot more complicated than that, but that's the gist. If studying is not an option for you, I encourage you to check the shortage occupation list, which can grant some similar benefits if you can fulfill those jobs.

On a more drunk note: The A38 has claimed my FWB's car, thus postponing what should have been the crowning event of glory to this very successful day. Alas, the karma gods giveth, and the karma gods taketh.

ci8ylf,"Are you out there, childhood friend?","I'm aware that this is a long shot and this might not even be the best subreddit for this, but I was wondering if you're out there. We used to go to the same gymnastics/trampolining club in Gillingham, Kent. I was a chubby little brown haired girl, and I think you were a blonde boy but I don't really remember, and I'm embarrassed to say I forgot your name. I'm sorry that I don't remember more about you. (Edit: I THINK your name was Harry? I definitely could be wrong though.)

The first week that I went, you were already there and I saw that you brought your DS. The next week I decided to bring my DS too and asked if we could play Pokémon together. You said yes and from that point on we were best friends. Every single week we'd play together when it wasn't our turn with the instructors. I had Pokémon pearl and you had Pokémon diamond, which I was super jealous of because blue was always my favourite colour despite being a girl. I think we were about 10 years old? You might have been slightly older than me, but I'm not sure. You had so many more Pokémon than me, and you taught me what an action replay was! I remember you cheating in all your shinies which I thought was so cool, you were basically a hacker (I won't tell Nintendo.) We traded machokes to evolve them and you kept mine because it was a higher level (cheeky!)  but you also traded me an Exploud for a bidoof and helped me complete my pokedex. I recently started playing pokemon pearl again, and it brought all my memories of you back.

I really loved playing with you! What are you up to these days? Did you keep going, even after I dropped out? (I couldn't really get the hang of the gymnastics, sorry! I'm still uncoordinated to this day.) I moved away from Kent when I was 16. I'm 21 now, and I'm studying at uni to be a game developer! Who knows, maybe I'll work on a Pokémon game one day 😊 Are you well? I'd love to hear from you, if you ever see this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/ci8ylf/are_you_out_there_childhood_friend/,1564177428.0,232,0.98,32,CasualUK,nguruvilu

chbsmf,Taking my GCSE’s at 30,"Hi CasualUKers. I’m 30 in less than two weeks and have very little to show for my time on Earth. I’m Autistic, Dyslexic &amp; Dyspraxic so school was not a fun place for me, and I took no qualifications or GCSEs away with me, I did however teach myself to read &amp; write after I had left but after many failed attempts trying to stay in college I gave up trying and let myself fall deeply in to depression. However, the last 3 years have been amazing for me, I met the love of my life and we’re getting married in June 2021 and the last piece of the puzzle for me is to get my GCSEs so I can at least somewhat succeed in a good job that isn’t flipping burgers because I hate that. My question is, is there anybody here that has done this, at my age or there abouts or even older and gone on to succeed? How are you recieved in a class that is potentially going to be way younger than I am? I’m very worried but more excited and very determind, I want this so badly.

There's a small dent on the back, hard to notice, but I feel bad and insist that I can pay to fix whatever needs doing. She points to the 08 reg and says something along the lines of the thing is more dents than car at this point, we swap details and off we go on our way.

Every parents nightmare when on a bus

Everyone else’s worst experience when on a bus with a screaming child

I played with her, gave her a drink and tried to distract her

Every so often she’d be happy and be loud laughing and every so often she would want to get down or cry because she wanted to walk about the bus (and I wouldn’t let her)

The lady behind me tapped me on the shoulder just as she was getting off for her stop

She told me I was doing fine and well done, her kids are grown up now but she can remember these times and not to worry 

Honestly, thank you, I am so sorry everyone’s bus ride wasn’t the best or the quietest but your support and kind words really helped me!

Instead of going home and crying and feeling like a shit mum I’m now home with a cup of tea cuddling my daughter and looking at ways we can avoid this again!

Thank you again

cevj27,"A two week road trip through Devon, England and it was fantastic.","Okay, I have to be honest. As a Dutchie I really didn't know about some insanely beautiful places the UK has to offer. But when my girl asked me if I would go on a 2 week road trip through Devon with here I asked myself ""what is there to see?"". Little did I know that Devon would be THAT beautiful. The North coast with massive cliffs and roughness, Exmoor with it's ancient forests and meadows, the South coast which is just insanely beautiful (hidden) beaches, palm trees and boat life and not to forget Dartmoor with fantastic eerie vibes. Not to forget the lovely people who we've met. Everyone made sure we had a fantastic time We loved every-second of it and I'm hungry for more!

Today I was behind her in the post office queue, And she couldn’t get her bank card in the reader slot for about 1 million goes at it (as usual) when I said ‘you’re re sliding it under the reader, you need to go up a little higher.’ 

She snaps at me ‘Don’t watch me when I’m getting my money, you’ll steal it, I know what your like. Always charging me more at the checkouts.’
(like we decided the price of things at the tills) 
I replied’ I was just trying to help like I used to at ‘my old work’. 
She said ‘well I don’t want your help’ 
I said ‘fine, I don’t know why I tried because your a nasty and rude and I don’t have to be nice to you anymore’
At this point the next counter became open and A she says to the cashier I need to go to that one because yours is broken’ 
I snapped ‘It’s not broken your not doing it right, now move so people can get served.’ 
I’m not like this normally like this but this woman just winds me up. I later went back to the post office and apologised to the Cashiers and they just laughed and said she’s awful to them too.

Apparently he thought it'd look cool if we were between the camera and the happy couple for one of the photos, it was one of the best weekends I've ever had and it's a really nice memory we have. I'm just wondering if any of you lovely people know anyone who got married there on the 7th of June (I think that was the day but I'm not entirely sure) and if you could ask them if they wouldn't mind sharing the photo, or if anyone knows of a wedding photographer who did a job/took a picture like that.

To make a very long story short I lost both parents within days of each other in 2019.  Both were unexpected and obviously it hit me hard.  

I just about had my head together then the covid nightmare started.  I lost my job at the end of last year and have spent almost every day since trying to get benefits sorted out without any luck so far.  I'm flat bloke no savings no job and don't know how much more I can cope with.

I've been trying for weeks to get a GP appointment cause previous mental health issues are back but getting fobbed off constantly.  I spoke to someone from my local council who is arranging support but it's likely to be another 4/5 weeks before that's going to happen and I genuinely don't know if I have that much fight left in me.

Anyone got any advice?  Even better would be if anyone else has been in the same situation and got through the other side?

lrc7j8,Unpopular UK opinion: I actually don't mind the British weather,"Born and raised in the UK, as someone with social anxiety, the British weather gives me something to talk about because its always so random.
It's nice to come into the office and say 'did you hear that rain last night!' 'apparently there's snow coming' or in summer 'oh I couldn't sleep last night it was way too warm' 
just simple things help me overcome my fear of talking to people and what to say especially at the minute when you can't exactly tell people what you've been up to while you're not at work other than ate, slept. 
I don't watch TV or soaps as well so it's hard to get into office talk when they talk about corrie, East enders, imaceleb, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/lrc7j8/unpopular_uk_opinion_i_actually_dont_mind_the/,1614171299.0,176,0.91,59,CasualUK,lilvamp616

c9j9mm,I think Fireman Sam might have just saved our villa.,"I just managed to set a fucking huge pan of olive oil on fire. I don't know about you, guys, but fucking huge fires aren't part of my daily life.

I'm on holiday in Crete with some of The Lads (*cue Chelsea Dagger*), and we were having a barbecue, so I decided to take charge of the potatoes to accompany. I parboiled them, chopped the garlic and rosemary, and set about heating the oil in a large pan. When I came to take the lid off the bastard, whoosh. Fire everywhere.

I haven't a flipping clue about fire in any form, but the second I saw it, after a brief period of internal screaming, my mind flashed back to an episode of Fireman Sam dealing with exactly this problem. As such, I set about soaking a teatowel under the tap, and had enough sense to tell one of the other lads approaching the pan with a bottle of water to stop (and call him a silly bastard into the bargain). Third go with the teatowel sorted everything out. But yeah; a program about Welshmen (of all things) I watched for a brief period of time as a child probably saved us from serious injury, and the property itself from serious damage. Mental.

c8l5c9,I had the weirdest interaction with my neighbour last night...,"Hey everyone, I just had the weirdest interaction with my neighbour. To set the scene, we moved in about 4 months ago and have spoken to a few of the neighbours a couple of times, including this lady; she gave us some reduced strawberries from the local shop when we moved in and randomly came round a couple of times asking if we'd seen her cat (it was behind her).

So I'm going out to the garage (separate block) to put some stuff away (all comically long things as they couldn't go out with the bins - curtain rail, clothes rail and a spare pipe &amp; head for the knackered Hoover we've been using to Hoover up plaster and sawdust whilst we're decorating) and she catches me at the door. Bearing in mind I have my hands totally full I say hi then keep moving...she has other plans and starts a chat - she's been to Waitrose (again) and got a load of reduced meat including a fucking gigantic joint of beef. 

(This is a direct quote) ""I don't need these, do you **want** these?"" 

I hastily try and decline - myself and my partner have just gone veggie, but she somehow convinces me to freeze them and give them to my partner's parents when we next see them. Fair enough, I thought, if she doesn't want them I'll do her a favour and take them off her hands. 

She then tries to give me all this random meat then tries to grab the Hoover pipe out of my (very full) hands, saying ""do you need this? I need this because mine broke"" I said something along the lines of ""we're not using it at the moment but it'll be good to keep it"" which didn't really convince her. As it was getting a bit awkward and my hands were full I suggested going and knocking on the door and giving the meat to my partner whilst I went out to the garages. 

So whilst I'm at the garage I get a text from my partner -  just washed her hair so wasn't going to answer the door. Great. I go back and find her peering through the door so I apologise and carry on the conversation from before (sans Hoover pipe). I then go to head inside and she goes ""this isn't free btw, you can't just take it"".  I look at the prices and it's about £10 of meat (even reduced). I definitely don't have that much cash and if I did it wouldn't be immediately to hand so I kinda go ""errrrr"" and go to give them back and explain. She then insists I take them, suggesting she could come round tomorrow and collect the money *for the meat I didn't even fucking want*. I decline again and she's quite insistent, suggesting writing a cheque (!???!?!?) Or doing a bank transfer. I decline again and again, but she's insistent. At this point I try and put a stop to things saying money's a bit tight and she stomps off in a huff so I (trying to be nice) call ""thanks anyways"" as she goes. Last thing I saw was her doing the same to another neighbour.

I get inside and share a confused 5 mins explaining to my partner how I managed to avoid being bullied into buying some meat we don't want or need. I've heard of similar scams in Rome and Paris but not on my doorstep from the neighbours! 

Am I the weird one in this? 

TLDR: old lady tries to give me her meat and grab my pipe, I decline and nearly end up on rouge traders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/c8l5c9/i_had_the_weirdest_interaction_with_my_neighbour/,1562138965.0,176,0.98,66,CasualUK,woah_dude_really

c7bcul,A very British burglary,"Despite this actually being a pretty serious/terrifying issue at heart, I feel like this whole adventure is British enough to share here...

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I was lying in bed, minding my own business and trying to fall asleep. At about 12:30 I heard my door open. At first I thought it was my ex coming back to collect some of her stuff, so I prepared myself to go give her a bollocking for coming into my house at midnight without warning. I went downstairs, fight-or-flight response already heavily engaged in fight given I'd decided I was going to do a bit of yelling.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of encountering the 4'11 woman I was expecting, I instead saw some 5'8(ish) bloke in a hoodie and multiple bags slung over his shoulder casually walking out my back door as if he belongs there. Naturally surprised, I shouted ""oi"", upon which he bolted out into the garden. It's important to note here that a) my next act was incredibly stupid\*, and b) as previously mentioned, my fight-or-flight was already heavily weighted towards the former.... so I chased him. Out the garden, through the back alley, out onto the street and then around the corner. Given I was not 2 minutes ago cuddled up in bed, I was only wearing my boxers (they're blue, with wolves on them, if anyone is wondering) and was thoroughly unprepared for a 300m sprint.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I guess being chased by an angry (almost)naked man in the dark scared this chap more than one would expect, and he dived into someone's front garden, abandoning his multiple bags on the turf and crawling beneath a bush. I picked up his bags, told him to fuck off, and walked home.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon my return home, I emptied out the bags to recover my presumably nicked items, and prepared myself a succession of drinks using aforementioned ex's alcohol. When I went to inspect the contents, I discovered that the poor guy hadn't had time to steal anything of mine. He'd gotten as far as unplugging the PlayStation before I came downstairs, and his bags were filled with the following items:

&amp;#x200B;

3x DvDs (8mm, Transporter 3 and Hot Tub Time Machine)

1x Open packet of Sainsbury's lightly salted tortillas

1x unsealed pot of Sainsbury's mild salsa

1x Stanley knife

3 Newspapers

1x packet of Piriteze anti-histamines

Multiple assorted chocolate bars

&amp;#x200B;

So in the end, I essentially robbed my burglar. If you're on here, random burglar guy from Eastbourne, I have your shit. I'll happily give it back to you because most of it smells weird anyway. Sorry for robbing you, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Reasons for it being incredibly stupid

1) he could have been armed (and was, just in his bag)

2) I just ran off leaving my back door open, so that wasn't smart

3) He could have had mates waiting outside

4) Most importantly - my kids were asleep upstairs. Big no-no, feeling very bad about that one.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought I’d share my preventative measures 

My top tips

-Wear sunglasses whilst outside (or inside as well if you’re feeling a bit Rock n roll) Wrap around glasses seem to be the most effective 

-Stay hydrated 

- apply a thin layer of Vaseline around the nostrils (this prevents pollen going up the nose)

- take an antihistamine 

-shower once you’ve been outside 

-wash your clothes and dry them inside 

-Close the doors and windows

c3gdmx,Crazy beggar lady gets put in her place...,"I've lived on the same council estate since I was 2 1/2 years old (over 40 years). Our local council got ""joined"" with the nearby city council about 18 years ago. Most of the houses have been bought (right to buy) but there are still a fair few that are ""local authority"" housing. My mum and dad live in a bought house on the estate and I live in a council house round the corner from them. For the first 25 years or so that I lived here, most people who moved onto the estate were from the town, since the ""joining"" there is no way you can get a house here unless you live in the nearby city. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind... hell most of the time I don't even notice as due to agoraphobia/depression/anxiety I don't often go out. I do however drive to m &amp; d's house and am very close to their next door neighbour. She's a very sweet little old lady :) If you are aware of what council estates are like, then you know that on every council estate there are at least 2 people/families who think they're ""hard"" (tough/able to fight \*for those not up on UK slang). I'm not tough, hard or scary in any way/shape or form...

Last year a woman moved from a flat in nearby city to a flat over the road from m &amp; d, during the first few weeks of her living here, she screamed at and/or hit at least 8 people. She was known as a ""hard lass"" where she used to live (personally I just think she was a bit loopy and nobody had stood up to her). From now on I'll call her CL - crazy lady. CL was now the talk of our small town (having been arrested, questioned and let go on numerous occasions) she was all over facebook and ALL the local gossips knew about her and she made almost the whole town uncomfortable. People would avoid looking at her on the bus and cross the road if they saw her out walking.

She'd lived here for a few months when she apparently she had a bit of trouble, financially. She stopped getting the bus and started walking to the shops, picking tab ends up and smoking them on the way and asking every person she met for money to buy cigs. Most people (knowing her reputation) would just give her a quid or something so that by the time she got to the shop, she'd have enough for a pack of 20. (I know what it's like to be desperate for a cig... I've cadged a couple off my sister or friends and made 10 super skinny rollies from them many times over the years but this woman would make enough for 20 a day just going to the shop!)

This was allowed to happen for a long time, until the day sweet neighbour (SN) was at the bus stop when crazy lady set off...

CL ""can you help me? I need to get into town and I'm skint""

SN ""ok, I'll lend you your bus fare, do you think you'll be able to pay me back when we get to town?""

CL ""probably""

On the bus for 20 minutes CL managed to talk SN into giving her another £10 for cigs! (she never paid that or the bus fare back!)

In the days and weeks that followed, SN changed from being chatty and outgoing to scuttling from her house to the bus stop and back, her living room curtains were never open and the lights were never on anymore. One day, I stopped her as she went in her gate and asked her if she was OK, turns out CL had been calling over almost every day to collect money from SN with a sob story about needing cigs and she was trying to hide from her... I told her to go in and put her lights on, sure enough, 10 minutes later, CL was opening the gate...

Me (doing my best ""nosy neighbour"") went out and said politely ""do you mind telling me why you're going in SN's garden?""

CL ""she's my friend and I've come to collect some money she borrowed""

Me ""she's not your friend and I think it's actually you who owes her money, friends don't use people like that!""

CL ""who the feck are you anyway and why do you care?""

Me ""I'm an actual friend of SN and I'd like you to leave her alone"",

CL ""I don't think so, I'm her friend and I'm getting my money""

Me ""If you don't leave now I'll either call the police or take you home myself""

(by this time my m &amp; d were in the garden and SN's best friend (across the road) was peering out of her window, (I felt a little bit tougher now I had friendly back-up)

Me ""look what you've done, we've got an audience now, I think you'd better go""

CL (shouting now)  ""why do you care? she's just a stupid old birch who has nothing to spend her money on""

Council estate mentality dictates that if someone is shouting in the street, you MUST go outside to see what's going on, by now there were about 15 people standing at their gates watching the (small) spectacle and I was starting to shake (partly through anger but mostly because of the anxiety etc.)

CL (screams) ""OI! SN! COME OUT I NEED SOME MONEY!""

The big bloke from next door the other way came out of his garden and stood next to CL, My dad, and Sam from 2 doors down join him. My dad is the most soft spoken man you could ever meet and he said ""I think it's probably past your bed time now, off you go"". CL looked around and saw the group of people, she seemed to come to her senses. She shifted her gaze to the floor and almost ran back to her flat. She doesn't visit SN anymore, she doesn't beg on her way to the shop anymore, she seems to have found enough money for the bus EVERY day and I hope she hasn't found anyone else to bully into buying her cigs for her.

Sorry it's a bit of a naff ending but SN doesn't scuttle to and from the bus stop anymore and even sits in her garden on sunny days to drink a cold lager with her best friend :) just goes to show the power of the people x",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/c3gdmx/crazy_beggar_lady_gets_put_in_her_place/,1561150826.0,149,0.9,40,CasualUK,mrsmadmick75

c2t9y5,r/casualuk donates to charity round 6 - the nomination thread,"Hello and welcome to Summer (I know, I know).

As you are most likely aware, in April 2018 we set up the /r/CasualUK charity threads to run every quarter. In 2018 we raised over £3,000 for Shelter, CALM and saving the hedgehogs and we kicked off 2019 with the trussell trust and MIND.   

Right, the rules:

- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. Once a charity has been chosen by r/casualuk it may not be the subs charity again. We want our support to reach as far as possible rather than just cycling through the same charities time and time again. 


- Please use this thread to nominate your chosen charities. **Please include a few lines to explain why this charity is important to you. Please also provide a link to the charity.**

- It must be a **registered charity** and It must be **UK based**.

- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.

- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.

- **Please no debating the rights / wrongs of a particular charity or the means of donating the cash via justgiving**.

So please get nominating/upvoting your favourite charities in the comments. The top 10 will progress to the next voting stage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/c2t9y5/rcasualuk_donates_to_charity_round_6_the/,1561017778.0,94,0.97,74,CasualUK,GFoxtrot

c245fb,"Help, I've split my trousers!","It's just after 5pm and as such I am about to leave work and get the bus home. Lucky me.

The only problem is that around 2pm today, whilst enjoying the company of several of my colleagues, I bent over to retrieve some loose paperwork. Unfortunately this was accompanied by a clear, crisp ripping sound as my outside trouser leg split from arsecheek to calf muscle. Mortified, I barreled upstairs, dodging questioning looks from the company directors as I sought sanctuary in my office.

Following a frantic search online, a good piece of advice seemed to be to put on the offending trousers inside-out, and staple the seam before reversing them. I very stealthily made my way to the men's room to do this, office stapler in hand. Feeling quite pleased with my haphazard job, I went to tie my shoelaces and get on with the rest of my day. At this point around twenty staples pinged off around the cubicle, leaving me just as exposed as when I started.

I don't quite think I can walk around Hull city centre like this without attracting attention, so I think I might try to cajole my dad into picking me up.

I was super happy and considered myself incredibly lucky and decided to pass him 20 quid our of the wallet, he refused, I offered ten he refused, I said please take something, but he got on his bike and rode away. 

I decided such a nice thing happening I should do something good. I text him asking for his prefered charities and that I'd like to donate the money I would have given him. He told me his mom died 18 years ago today, and I should thank his parents for raising him right and if possible could I spare a thought or prayer for her, his father and their 6 children. My heart! The wallet I dropped was really important to me as it was my mom's from when I was in her belly, it's sentimental. 

I donated 20 to the nspcc. I just wanted to share what this lovely man did for me, I would've had a breakdown I reckon. And if possible spare a thought or prayer for his family of nice lovely people.

c01aqh,Important information re Aussie crisps and their packets.,"I’m currently in Australia, and just wanted to give any Brit travelling over here a run down on the crisp packet situation. If you think you could just stroll into your local supermarket and mindlessly grab a bag of your favourite flavour of crisps assuming that the coloured packets correspond with the ones in the Uk, you’d be very wrong. 

Smith’s seems to be the Aussie equivalent of Walkers and let’s just say the Aussies have fucked the colour scheme up, big time. Here we go:

Green - Chicken (I know, fucking mental)

Blue - Original (aka ready salted.)

Pink  - Salt &amp; Vinegar (this might be the worse one)

Yellow - Cheese and Onion (ooo lets make the packet the same colour as cheese so people don’t get confused. Pathetic.)

Oh and they call them Chips. 

Anyway, stay vigilant when travelling to foreign lands everyone, you could get in serious dietary trouble by making assumptions. Don’t trust your instincts, none of that matters abroad.

lbykxk,Growing up British working class,"So me and my sister (I’m 30 years old) were having a catch-up, and we were chatting about all the stuff that we had when growing up (90s). 

Thought it’d be a fun thread for /r/CasualUK to see what other stuff we missed. Pretty definitive list so far!

- We used to eat Tomato Ketchup sandwiches
- Always had “Smiths” crisps, not Walkers
- Only got bought “broken biscuits”, about two good biscuits in the entire damned thing
- Didn’t have a shower until we were almost 16 years old 
- We didn’t have central heating, only a coal fire until we moved out of our first house when we were 13 
- Grandparents had Cartoon Network, our life changed when we got Sky TV much later on 
- Being bunged in a car at 3am in the dark with no idea what was going on, to go on holiday at a Haven Holidays campsite 
- French Fancies being a treat, but only being allowed a certain colour to stop family wars 
- Not having mayonnaise or BBQ sauce until moving out
- Having first Chinese at 18
- Not going to first curry house with mates until mid 20s 
- 96% of meals would be cooked at 180c for 20 minutes
- Having your own Argos catalog at Christmas, and circling all the things you wanted 
- Buying Pokemon cards from the market stall in the basement of the big shopping centre, next to a butchers and a carpet stall
- Not going to first gig until mid 20’s
 Moving out and thinking fabric softener was the same as detergent, because you never had it

bxuc4f,"Yesterday I posted an image of notes and sweets I was giving to my neighbours regarding a party. It was met with insults, threats and general negativity. All I'm asking is you remember there's a person on the other side of the screen.","I've been on Reddit for nine years. I'm not a stranger to the casual insults that fly around. I've done it myself. Yesterday I spent the afternoon feeling genuinely attacked and depressed after reading through the comments left on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/bxd1u7/im_having_a_party_i_dont_want_to_annoy_the/) regarding having a party.

I get it. It's CasualUK, it's just a bit of banter. It's just a joke. Don't take it personally. It's not meant in a nasty way. Now multiply being insulted/attacked/generally made to feel bad by an inbox of comments. Is it still just a joke? I began replying to the comments in a lighthearted way and by the end, I felt genuinely depressed. Mentally drained.

You're a cunt. I'd sabotage your party. I'd call the police on you. What a dick. Fuck you and your stupid party. Just a tirade of negativity. All this for a lighthearted post about some notes and sweets.

I'm not here to debate the content/context. You want to say something or disagree, you're free to do so of course and I get it, you've only got a photo to go on. Not all the details. I  just want to remind you that there is actually a person on the other side of this screen. There are feelings being affected when you write these things. I'm not some monster. It's very easy to forget that you're not just having some light hearted banter with someone. You're genuinely making that person feel crap for the rest of the day because of that banter bandwagon it's so easy to be part of. 

I know you might think this is an overreaction, since you didn't have the inbox of insults, but I'm entirely serious. You made someone pretty depressed yesterday for the purposes of an upvote. Yes I know it sounds silly for a 35 year old guy to say ""The internet hurt me"". I've been here long enough to realise this happens. But this is CasualUK. We're supposed to be a welcoming community. Not making someone feel shit.

Anyway, I'm not a monster. I post [flowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/87a42c/tesco_are_delivering_free_daffodils_with_my_food/), and [nice buildings](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/8v9rlu/the_royal_liver_building_a_grade_i_listed/), [cupcakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/98kqr0/i_made_some_chocolate_cupcakes_covered_in_nutella/), and [sandwich infographics](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9k4n54/on_thursday_i_asked_you_what_you_like_on_your/)

I'm just saying sometimes this subreddit isn't banter anymore. It's vicious and can affect someone's mental health for the day. Please just bare it in mind.

So I say, ""don't worry about it"" and get on the train with the doors closing behind me. As the train pulls away, I realise my ray ban sunglasses had fallen out of my pocket and he was probably holding them out, trying to say, ""hey, you dropped this."" 

And I was like, ""nah, don't worry about it."" Or did it sound like, ""*Sunglasses*? Do have any idea how much I make an hour? Do you think this is worth my time? Just keep them."" Great.  

Those sunglasses that I got when I was in a job that paid more and can no longer afford to replace. Even better. 

Doubled back, went upstairs and spoke to staff... nothing. Really hoping he turned them in at another station, but honestly, how I came off... I can understand him just saying fuck that guy. But that guy is me! Excellent.

I met up with the Mrs for a Yo Sushi lunch today, something we hardly ever get to do since we work in different offices.  So Lunch was meant to be a real treat, a reward for getting through a shitty Wednesday morning.  I was propper jonesing for some Salmon Skin Rolls, like REALLY looking forward to them, practically salivating as I went through the door.

Get to the bar, look at the menu - where are my Salmon Skin Rolls?. Gone. Nowhere to be seen.  I ask the wait staff where they went.  Turns out, they've been gone since last November and are never going to be coming back **BECAUSE** the jeweller next-door complained to head office about the smell of salmon. 

That's right, a single poxy jeweller from an insignificant spa town caused such an uproar, was being such a bully (the staff's words, not mine) that *EVERY YO SUSHI IN THE COUNTRY* no longer sells a beloved dish because of this one tat peddler.  He claims it was the smell the was driving away customers but I'm pretty sure it's a) his prices b) his underwhelming merchandise and c) he's one of at least a dozen jewelers in a 200m^2 block

We’re earlier stage than most of the other startups in the accelerator, and one of the few focused on consumer tech, but we still graduated with the keynote speech at their pitch event! Needless to say we're incredibly excited, and the feedback we got from the post we did on here was instrumental in the development :)

My doctor has just signed me off for 2 weeks with depression and anxiety, I have got a night away in Liverpool booked on Friday and was really looking forward to it, I'm wondering if I should still go now.

I'm not sure of the etiquette? It's unlikely but I worry about bumping into someone from work, which is silly I know, but I've been off before with this and got a bollocking when I went back for being seen shopping in Morrisons! I was told that I shouldn't be leaving the house if I'm signed off. 
That was a few years ago under an old management team but it's still making me feel uneasy.
The hotels all booked and paid for as are trains, so I can't get refunds and I could probably do with a bloody good night out, but I don't know what to do.

I'm not claiming they're the best individual item (I'm not *that* out there), but they're the item that does the most work. You need something to cut through the grease and stodge of the rest of the food, and beans do that work. So small and yet so mighty. And the combo of egg, bean, and sausage is the highlight of the full English. People may disagree, but just know you're wrong. MVP trophy goes to beans every time.

This opinion is closely related to my other, more controversial belief that the gherkin does the most work in a burger.

bpv8td,Tip from a London Train Driver,"Some of us are kind enough and do reopen the doors!

From my experience people turn away in frustration as soon as the door button don’t work, I will notice them in the camera and reopen the doors and by that time they are facing other way in frustration or possibly embarrassment!

So from me... keep an eye on the outside of the carriage, if the orange lights are lit, we have reopened the door! And listen out for the beeps, they’re different when the doors open and when then close

Anyway

I reopen doors a lot and this happens everyday lol just face the train and you might get one of us nice lot

Have a nice day lol

It's Morrisons.

I know you're probably sitting there looking at your screen, thinking 'Morrisons, really?'

Yes, Morrisons donuts. 

The dough is so... springy.

The jam tastes like it's HD. 

**They use icing sugar instead of granulated sugar.**

I know.

I know what you're thinking. 

'Icing sugar on a donut, does that work?'

YES IT DOES.

Whatever you do today, I promise you your day will be made instantly better by ditching work / school / your responsibilities to society, and getting a pack of donuts from Morrisons. 

Which one?

IT DOESN'T MATTER, THEY'RE ALL GREAT. I'VE TRIED THEM ALL.

la7gay,"Thank you United Kingdom and CasualUK, for an unforgettable 16 months and I hope we will cross our paths in the foreseeable future!","As many of you might have gathered, I have just graduated and on my way back home after my residence in the country officially ended! I studied for a masters in &lt;redacted&gt; Economy, and it was life changing, I have learnt a lot over these 12 months at Uni than I did in three years back home. Uni truly was a sensational experience and for those considering a degree, I'd recommend you start it when you can physically go into classrooms, the difference in the experience of online and on site learning are world's apart.

I have learnt a lot in these last 16 months, from everyone around me and the experience I have had here. I have never felt uncomfortable, racially or socially, and I have never felt left out.

I have had memories that will stay with me for a lifetime, I have walked the streets of London more times than I have walked my city back home, I was able to fulfil a lifelong dream of watching a premier league game live at Old Trafford, I loved the insane catalogs of everything I could possible want from Argos and Sainsbury and that Waitrose is for the posh! Cheesy Wotsits grew on me, so did the Bacon Double Cheeseburger, Terry's Chocolate Orange and Guinness, oh Guinness, I don't think I can go on in life without a pint of Guinness Stout every now and then.!

The lockdown was a bummer, no, actually the virus was a bummer, but between September '19 and March '20, I lived a lifetime of happiness and emotion. I was never active here but I have been subbed since I landed and constantly giggling and cracking up seeing some top quality stuff here (lurk all the time), and I'll continue to do the same. But I will miss being in the know, miss being on the inside jokes and miss taking a walk from Westminster to Tottenham Court Road every now and then. I have been around, I have met a lot of people but I have never experienced the same warmth and treatment as I got from you lot. I love the British sense of humour, it may not seem like much but I just absolutely crack open sometimes.

All in all, there was not a single moment where I stopped to think, ""I do not belong here"", most of the people I met said they never would have guessed I didn't spend my entire life here, you made it that comfortable for me.

Times are very tough right now, so I must leave, but I promise to be back, someday, because I have never felt home like I have felt it here, and I wish you all the best, with the pandemic and the new policies!

Love,

If you yelped in pain and the teacher stirred, you could *never* tell her about Compass. You would often find a small group of boys wandering out to lunch with bleeding wounds, another game of Compass fought well. I still bear a couple of scares 15 years on. What on earth was that about?

l9hyxm,I just found out that our bumblebees are in serious trouble,"Seeing bumblebees has always made me happy.  When I was a kid I would tell my mum if I spotted a big one in the garden; its furry bum wobbling through the air from plant to plant.

But  I went to an online talk and, if I remember correctly, they said that the UK has 25 types of bumblebee.   **Three are already extinct and 10 are endangered.**    (There are also threats to solitary bees too.)

Honeybees can fly for miles to get food, but bumbles might stick to a *single garden*.  So they really need as much plant life as possible.

There were lots of tips on how to protect bumblebees but the top two are the simplest and most important.

**Plant as many flowers as you can.** (Ideally from seed as garden centre flowers can have pesticides)  If you don't have space for flowers, you can plant herbs.

**Plant flowers that are different shapes and sizes.**  A bee with a short tongue can't get food from a longer flower, so mixing up types means there's more food for everyone.

Bees like yellow and pinky/purple flowers.  They can see them better.

Perennials are better than annuals - apparently the root system makes for richer food, or somesuch thing.

Wildflowers and hay meadow types are very good.

If possible try to plant native.

&amp;#x200B;

Anwyay, I'm not an expert but I didn't want to wait to share this.  Of course look into things yourself, but hopefully this is a good starting point.

Someone posted an AMA with a bee expert on a gardening sub :

l9fdys,I am a Medievalist and It it is my life's dream to go to England,"My name is Warwick and I am a 27 yr old American Male with English ancestary, who lives in Maryland. I work in Plumbing, but Medieval history is my life. I wanted it as my career, but I am working class and was unsure how I could afford it.

My favorite periods are Anglo-Saxon, 12th century and Hundred Years War. 1327 to 1453 is my favorite as it is the peak of chivalry. I am also really intersted in Henry I as he laid the foundation for Plantaganet England.

I am considering learning French and Latin to immerse myself into what it would be like to be a Medieval English noble. I already go to Latin Mass and I reccomend it if you have an interst in the Middle Ages. I am a huge English Ale enthusiast and Cask is one of the best drinking experiences I have ever had. I also like Mead and Wine.

My plans are not set in stone, but I want to see Avalon (Glastonbury Tor), Canterbury Cathedral (Edward of Woodstock's effigy) and Durham (Battle of Neville's Cross). 

I enjoy Maryland and while we do have good ale, nature and churches here I still dream of England daily. If I some how, by God's grace make it far enough in Plumbing to make my skill marketable enough to one day live in England, then my life will be complete.

Great, this means I'm going to have to bring them to someone to open for me rather than be discreet at the self check out. Oh well, I went to the till and paid, got some odd looks from people (no idea why people act like it's so strange for a grown man to buy condoms, or anyone to buy them for that matter). Got past this point and as I'm walking out the door the fucking alarm goes off! Had security walk over to me so I could show them my comdoms and receipt, all while people are looking over thinking ""did this bloke just try to steal condoms"".

I work in IT support in a school which, as anyone in the same line of work will attest to, is the lowest of the low.

We've had a **major** issue today with printers and servers and whatnot and, for the most part, I've appreciated everyone's patience but one or two have wound me up something rotten. To them, I (as in me, personally) have completely ruined their day.

... and to top it all, when I explained to my line manager that I need a bit of breathing space, I was told to ""give them the benefit of the doubt. They're under a lot of pressure when they're in front of the class and something isn't working"". I'm so glad I kept my cool.

bey363,PSA: if you are heading to the coast this weekend please be careful around the water.,"This weekend we are forecast lovely weather so a lot of people will be heading to the beach, we are also forecast 6ft waves, you can see the surf report for Cornwall below

https://magicseaweed.com/Watergate-Bay-Surf-Report/961/

6ft waves at a 15 second period (a wave every 15 seconds) means these waves will be big and very powerful, these conditions are great for surfing, so it's going to very busy with all types of people in the water.

Please for your own safety follow the rules of the lifeguards, keep within the bathing area, they are there for a reason, getting sucked out to sea by a rip current is scary, and also puts others in danger when they have to come and rescue you.

If there is no lifeguards and you don't know the area, avoid going in and if you do go in, don't go out of your depth.

If you have kids, keep them safe, and be careful of the tides. 

You don't want to be those parents on the news crying because little timmy got bashed into the rocks and drowned! 

Please add any more advice I've missed below..

bdv310,Why must life be this way? And the only time it wasn't.,"(I know this sounds very r/thathappened, but believe me, this actually happened with a supermarket guy)

I'm 19(M) and i can barely pass for 18 at the best of times, the kicker though? I get fucking ID'd for cans of Monster in asda/morrisons/tesco. The only time i got a can without ID was in a Morrisons a few days back. The conversation with the self service guy went like this:

Guy: Do you have any ID?

Me: Does my Uni card count?

Guy: No sorry, i need to see proof that you're over 16.

Me: I'm in uni though??

Guy: Still...

Me: Mate, it's a uni student card.

Guy: It could be faked though.
(Now for context, I'm a Scouse lad studying in Bangor, North Wales) 

Me: Why would fake going to Bangor Uni??

Guy: That's a good point.

Me: So...?

Guy: Enjoy your monster.


To this day, it's the weirdest supermarket interaction I've had, apart from when someone thought i was faking my accent for attention, but thats for another time.

If you got this far, thanks for reading my first ever reddit post. Xoxo

It may vary depending on where you live but I've managed to save at least £10 every weekly shop by going to my local butchers. Plus they know what they're talking about when it comes to what you want to do with the meat. If there's something your scared to cook, you can ask them how to cook the meat for what you want. They're very helpful, the meat is much better than supermarkets and even better, probably the same/lower price as the supermarkets!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/bdsjs3/remember_to_go_to_your_local_butchers_for_your/,1555412312.0,82,0.91,82,CasualUK,Nevarc_Xela

bdlua2,"Took my dog for a walk, got offered a blowjob","So, this afternoon I decided to take my dog for a walk at the local nature reserve which also happens to be a local dogging hotspot, though, honestly, this didn't even cross my mind at the time. I just wanted a nice place to walk my dog.

Upon arriving I saw several men in their cars with no dogs in sight but nothing really clicked.

I got my dog out of the car and just as I was about to cross the road I saw some guy pull in taking a big old look at me in his new corsa. 

Not thinking anything of it I headed up the steps into the nature reserve only to get a few minutes in to find the guy I saw earlier walking behind me. He quickly caught up, and honestly he must have got a bit of a dash on to even catch up with me. He was dressed much too well to be out for an afternoon stroll and quickly engaged in conversation.

I engaged back thinking he was just some friendly guy out for a walk on his break or something but it very quickly turned sexual. He started showering me with compliments and asked me if I knew  ""what this  place was"" Asking what I was into etc. Sex wise. It was kinda unsettling how open he was about it with a total stranger.

I was so on guard the whole time and ready to break his jaw because he gave off such a predatory vive. He asked me if I was into men, I told him I wasn't and he said ""such a shame, J would have given you a  blowy"" which was a bit much for me. Told him I wasn't into that sort of stuff and kept moving, but he kept following!

I got so far into the nature reserve and decided to turn back as this guy would not leave me alone. I told him I was gonna head back and he shook my hand and was like ""I'll walk back with you, I was only gonna follow you and see what you were doing anyway"" wtffff 

On the way back he started Feeding me sob stories about his recent operation and his mother with cancer like it was gonna change my mind on the matter of being straight.

He was also showing me pics and videos of his recent sexual encounters and fuck buddies throughout the walk.

I didn't know whether to chin him or not, but the way he was so casual about the whole thing was so disarming. 

In the end he asked for my number, to which I told him no. To which he then told me about the guy in the range rover who had been there when I pulled up who he spoke to upon arriving who told him ""I checked him out and he has a good package ""

Wtf, safe to say I'm never going there again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/bdlua2/took_my_dog_for_a_walk_got_offered_a_blowjob/,1555365476.0,108,0.97,54,CasualUK,DDGibbs

bcbz88,The UK Games industry doesn't get enough praise,"It is a shame.

A lot of the games that we produce here are not seen as British, and often get lumped in with 'American games'. Our games industry needs a LOT more praise than it gets. I mean, this is just a small smattering of British games which nobody ever thinks of as British:

\- Grand Theft Auto series

\- Red Dead Redemption 2

\- Fable Series

\- Forza Horizon Series

\- Burnout Series

\- Halo Wars 2

\- Banjo Kazooie (and all RARE games, for that matter)

\- Arkham Series

\- Cannon Fodder

\- Lego Games

\- Lemmings

\- LittleBigPlanet

\- Timesplitters

\- Total War

\- Project Cars

\- Football Manager

\- Wipeout

\- Project Gotham

That is before you even cover Codemasters, Bullfrog, and a whole host of indies.

So, why do people only ever talk about American games and Japanese games, when we arguably produce the best racing games in the world AND many of the games we have produced have completely shaken up the games industry? Open world games would not be around still if Grand Theft Auto didn't show it was properly viable.

So, can we have some praise for British gaming for a change?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/bcbz88/the_uk_games_industry_doesnt_get_enough_praise/,1555065073.0,398,0.99,172,CasualUK,[deleted]

bar7a5,I need to change up my life.,"Morning /r/CasualUK.

I'll be honest and to the point, my life has been in a bit of a slump over the last few years and I need to break out of it. Crashed out of uni a few years back, been working a job a monkey could do, and I can't really keep going down this way.

Aside from a few years spent chasing something in college and uni before realising it wasn't for me, I've never had any goal of what I want in life, or anything like that. And I can't help but get jittery and anxious whenever I just think about jobs and *life* and stuff. I always resist change out of fear, but I recognise that there's a point where I can't stick to this - and NEET life will destroy me in every way.

I've no marketable skills, no goals or plan. I feel like I've lost my sense of identity since crashing out of uni years ago, and I'm ashamed to say it, but emotionally and situationally I'm the same as my 17 year old self, and thinking about *life* really just freaks me out.

Socially, I'm kinda eh. I'm thankful that I get on well with the guys at work, there's no-one I really know in the local area, all my old mates are too far away (haven't learnt to drive still, maybe I should consider that a start?), but I always make sure to attend the local on quiz night.

I'm only posting here because it's one of the few avenues I have, I trust you a lot more than the advice stuff, and I won't find anywhere else where I'll be told to simply to stop being a git and to pack in my adverse attitude.

Thanks lads.

Edit: Thanks for the replies, can't promise to do a 180 on the spot any time soon but I really appreciate it.

Last week was quite the mixed bag. They started with mini cheesecakes which, like the brownie challenge earlier in the series, most of the bakers overcomplicated and ruined. They then made a disgusting looking suet putting with an ENTIRE LEMON in it for the technical, which they all failed at completely. They then made some beautiful jelly art cakes, although both Peter and Marc had a bit of a mare.
Laura won the technical by being less shit than everyone else, and poor Marc was eliminated.

b8m5yi,My faith in humanity has been restored thanks to a sympathetic train manager,Just been to Edinburgh with the wife for a night as an anniversary present. We were just sat in the hotel bar killing time before we had to catch our train when the missus suggested checking the times on the tickets one last time just to be sure. All booked throug a travel agents by a family member so I thought there wouldnt be an issue. Its was then we noticed that the tickets had tomorrows date on! Panic set in and we dashed to the train station early to try and sort it. Long story short we ended up catching a Train Manager on an outbound LNER train who said if we were quick we could jump on his train no bother as it was stopping at Darlington where we were heading. We were just in the nick of time as they were closing the doors as we ran up! Absolute legend. He turned what could have an utterly horrendous situation and a highly expensive nightmare into a pleasant journey down the east coast of Scotland. Nice to know there are good people out there,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/b8m5yi/my_faith_in_humanity_has_been_restored_thanks_to/,1554225827.0,69,0.97,13,CasualUK,jackfletch89

I though this was quite funny as the old lady sat next to me was getting rather pissed off but it was easy solved by just opening it again. I like to look at the clouds. The mother of this child took offence to me opening the blind back up and told the kid that he shouldn't worry about the other people on the plane and should do what ever he wanted and then carried on making passive aggressive remarks to another women. You know the type I mean.. I didn't like this so I got her attention to explain I have no issue with her child and if she would like he can use my tablet which has many many games, TV show, films and so on. She scoffed at me .... The old lady next to me took great offence to this and started to pass the child straight up sugar cubes on the descent to Manchester all the while with the evil grin on her face. The next time I saw this child was outside the train station platform screaming and going wild running around and being a arse. The mother looked very stressed out and flustered.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Voting will remain open until Lunchime on Monday 1st April at which point we will post the just giving link for the winning charity**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**A reminder of the idea and the rules**

&amp;nbsp;

* We are going to donate money to a chosen charity every quarter. 1st April, 1st July, 1st October, 1st January.
* The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter.

* It must be a registered charity, it must have an online donation page (preferably on JustGiving) and it must be UK based.

* The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.

* If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.

b4mw0f,r/casualuk donates to charity round 5 - the nomination thread,"Hello and welcome to Spring. .

As you are most likely aware, in April 2018 we set up the /r/CasualUK charity threads to run every quarter. In 2018 we raised over £3,000 for Shelter, MIND and saving the hedgehogs and we kicked off 2019 with the trussell trust.  

Right, the rules:

- The charity will be chosen each quarter by yourselves. If charity A is chosen for April, charity A may not be eligible until the following year, to ensure that a different charity receives donations each quarter.

- Please use this thread to nominate your chosen charities. **Please include a few lines to explain why this charity is important to you. Please also provide a link to the charity.**

- It must be a **registered charity** and It must be **UK based**.

- The top ten nominations (decided by upvotes) will then go into a strawpoll where we determine the overall winner. Once we have a winner for that quarter, we will create a JustGiving page and have a final thread for donations.

- If you wish to donate to that particular charity, please give whatever you feel comfortable with but as a guideline, we think it would be fantastic if we could donate the cost of a pint in our local.

- **Please no debating the rights / wrongs of a particular charity**.

So please get nominating/upvoting your favourite charities in the comments. The top 10 will progress to the next voting stage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/b4mw0f/rcasualuk_donates_to_charity_round_5_the/,1553367967.0,70,0.94,53,CasualUK,GFoxtrot

The platform for my train doesnt have lift access and to be completely honest I struggle with stairs.

So there is this thing called train/travel assist where you can call them up the day or so before you travel and they make arrangements to make the trains accessable. Usually by making the train come in on a stepfree platform.

So I call them up and we'll call him Fred (a very helpful chap) looks to see what he can do to help me. 

Well.... Apparently it is easier and cheaper to get a taxi to take me from my depature station and drop me off at my arrival station than it is to shift trains about. Which is awesome and I am very greatful for this. 

The ridiculous part is i simply need to have my train tickets which as I  have a disabled railway card (gets a 1/3 off the cost of the ticket ) means I'm going  on a journey of almost an hour in a cab for less than a daily bus ticket for my local area. 

Dont let anyone knock the public transport in the UK. It may be a bit pricey if you commute and sometimes a wee bit late but overall and especially in this case its awesome.

aya6qt,What are you reading? - World Book Day edition,"It's World Book Day today, so never mind the kids and their costumes, what are you reading and what do you think of it?

I was off sick yesterday and read *The Silent Companions* by Laura Purcell. It's a sort of psychological gothic horror thing. The main action is set in 1865, and features a pregnant woman, Elsie, newly widowed and sent to her husband's ancestral home with his cousin to bury him and mourn. They discover a silent companion, a 3D effect life-sized painted figure made of wood, which unsettles Elsie. There's a frame story set sometime later in an asylum so we know it doesn't end well for her, and a diary from 1635 which sheds some light on the reason for what happens.

It's got major *The Turn of the Screw* vibes, and Elsie is a sympathetic character. The writing style of the 1635 diary takes a little while to find its feet, but I liked the idea of the psychiatrist getting Elsie to write her story in third person and Purcell never slips up and tells us something Elsie couldn't know; the resulting narrative is consuming but makes it easier to question Elsie's sanity. The only character that felt a bit flat was the psychiatrist; I felt we could've got a bit more of him becoming absorbed in Elsie's story, although I did come to this off the back of Margaret Atwood's *Alias Grace*, another suspected insane murderess telling her side of the story. All in all I really enjoyed it, even though the genre isn't usually my thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/aya6qt/what_are_you_reading_world_book_day_edition/,1551945507.0,52,0.93,264,CasualUK,satanspanties

It seems to be a site that ripped the broadcasts and archived them but it's all available to watch. There's about 500,000 odd videos on there, by far the best online streaming site for tv i've come across.

2. Even if you go all out, it's still not likely to cost you more than a tenner.

3. Pancakes taste amazing.
 
4. You can abuse everyone for making crap pancakes

5. Valid excuse to have pudding for tea.

6. You can pour sugar on pancakes and no-one will judge you.

7. The nostalgia of remembering crap school pancakes. 

8. It means easters coming where you can be a fat pig again. 

9. You don't even have to make your own batter anymore.

10. Because without a doubt, the first one is always shit.

ax7lud,Pancake day trauma,"Tomorrow is Shrove Tuesday, pancake day if you will, a joyous occasion all around, or so one would think, but not for me. For me it is a day of fear and uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

My work canteen is great. Everything is home-cooked, fresh, tasty, and really cheap.

Flashback two years, **pancake day 2017**. We sign up the day before and can request absolutely anything, feeling a bit cocky I go for blueberry and chocolate. Expectations: fresh blueberries with grated or melted chocolate on top. Reality: the pancake had been heated up with the blueberries inside, ending up with a catastrophe of slightly burnt chocolate and boiling hot blueberry juice oozing out. Looked and tasted awful.

**Pancake day 2018** \- I look back at the year before with regret, appreciating that I maybe asked for too much. I bring it back to basics, pancakes 101, lemon and sugar, the classic. What could go wrong? I got a bit excited and ordered four, forgoing any other sustenance in anticipation. I race down to the canteen, my first two pancakes come out, nice artistic sprinkling of sugar on-top - good touch. I dive in and to my equal horror and bemusement... lemon curd, hot lemon curd in a pancake. Ended up with a similar level of gloop as the year before as the curd separated out.

Which brings me to **Pancake day 2019**, I have about an hour left to write down my request. Do I, don't I? How specific should I be?

irmgon,FAO: UK Tomato Canners Re: Enough of your bullshit,"I know Big Tomato reads the CasualUK subreddit, they've got eyes everywhere. And I can't think of a more appropriate place to finally take a stand.

NO-ONE WANTS PEELED PLUM TOMATOES IN A CAN. NOBODY HAS EVER WANTED PEELED PLUM TOMATOES IN A CAN. EVER.

If you care about tomatoes, you'll buy one of the 99 different varieties thereof taking up shelf space in Sainsburys, while the normal vegetables are relegated to the top corner of Vegetable Aisle 9 3/4s.

No-one at the corner shop has *ever* wanted peeled plum tomatoes. They want chopped tomatoes. The normal ones. The ones that make a sauce without you have to bash them with a wooden spoon like a twatting maniac.

You, through your perfidy, would ruin my pizza sauce. I had to run the blender for 20 seconds, at 11pm (I'm ashamed and I always will be), because you think it's ok to put giant red blobs in the can where normal tomatoes should be.

If you must sell these dinner-ruining disasters, will you please have the decency to sell them in bright orange cans that don't look identical to the normal tomatoes, that we will know to avoid them.

We have suffered under this regime too long. If you have any shred of decency, you will withdraw these culinary bear-traps, or you will label them properly. Nothing less will be accepted.

For example, there was some programme on about healthy eating and saving money, and the way they spoke you'd think they were talking to 10 year olds, saying things like ""exercise is good for you"" ""vegetables are part of a good diet"" do they really think we are that stupid?

She said yes!!!!
Everything went according to plan! Massive thanks to her mum dad and brother that helped it all go smoothly, she didn’t read the poem out loud like I’d hoped but she got to the end and started crying her dad asked what that last bit said and she said will you marry me out loud and friend I came through the kitchen door after sneaking into the house. When I saw her I just wanted to hug and kiss her so I didn’t get on one knee and the porch was a little bit cramped with the whole family gathered at the front door 😂
She cried I cried her mum cried her dad even had a tear streaming. Then within about 8 minutes her mum saw the ring properly and screamed “for fuck sake it’s bigger than mine, I’m gunna have to get a new one”

I’ve had a few drinks and words cannot describe how happy I am. Thank you r/casualuk for your well wishes and for being an amazingly wholesome place!

asrf33,I know buses are pretty bad but...,"...don't go shouting at the bus driver that the buses are ""always fucking late"" and that they ""drive off while I'm sticking my arm out"". There are children on the bus. And many other passengers. We don't want to hear it. I don't wanna hear it. Especially after a long busy day at work.

And I'll have you know this bus you got on was 3 minutes early. He sat there for 3 minutes before pushing on. I get it, buses are either late or early, but they run on a schedule that can't be guaranteed due to 5'o'clock rush hour.  

To add to the schedule part. If you're late and you're bounding down the street with your arm out like you were seeking Kyle, the bus has an obligation to her/his current passengers especially if the bus was already running late. If this were a train you'd be fucked. 

To sum it up, don't blame public transport for your fault, they're people working jobs too. Got a complaint? Don't complain to the first driver you see when he/she has done nothing wrong. Call or email your complaint.

And on that bombshell, a very big thanks Driver. Don't let the bastards get ya down.

&amp;#x200B;

As I walked past one of them shoved a couple of cans of Lynx down the waistband of his sweatpants (obviously) and went to walk out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a dad right, so my instinct took over and I bellowed (literally) ""PUT THAT BACK AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE SHOP"" - I got a look of terror from the tea-leaf and he took it out and legged it - followed by his mates. I didn't even get any lip off 'em. Odd.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not a hard looking chap (tall and skinny) but my Dadness took over and I felt a good rush of adrenaline - until my wife said 'what if his mum can't afford to by him deodorant'.

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I a dick for stopping the little shit, or was it the right thing to do. I know it's Big Retail and they don't feel any kind of financial loss, but shouldn't we stop this shit if seen? Or what if he COULDN'T afford the spray.

&amp;#x200B;

I've missed you awful bastards quite a bit. I've missed being in Spoons and complaining to my mates that we've ended up in Spoons. I've missed paying extortionate amounts of money to get a 10 minute train journey. I've missed Freddos, even though I never actually eat them. I've missed buying 5 doughnuts for 65p.

So cheers to all of you for providing me with homesickness fuel while I've been gone, this sub was a lovely escape when I was sick and tired of scooters beeping at me all day in Hanoi. Or when I got food poisoning in Koh Samui.

Also, yes I'm pissed. I'm in an airport after all.

This is a pointless post and I'm rambling now so I'll say cheerio now! See you all in 24 hours or so.

arjoc9,Anybody else finding people talking REALLY loudly at gigs is becoming a bigger and bigger problem?,"I've been to gigs up and down the country over the years and I'm finding it's becoming more and more difficult to enjoy live music due to extremely noisy talkers in the crowd.

Went to see Billy Joel in Birmingham a few years ago and these two guys behind us who hadn't seen each other for years starting having a catch up chat about everything they'd missed with each other instead of watching a legendary singer on what could be one of his last tours.

Luckily a guy next to them told them to shut up and they did.

Went to The Human League in Glasgow last year and this gaggle of middle aged women were screeching away behind us. My dad politely asked them to be quiet which they ignored and when I told them they were spoiling the show for everyone around them, they just started giving me the Vicky.

Saw Chrvches in Glasgow last night. I got stuck next to a group of people who were shouting at each other through every song, with one of them not even facing the stage. The people beside me obviously thought so as well as they kept glancing at them throughout the gig.

I'm all for people having fun and I'm used to a low level of buzz throughout gigs, but it's becoming more and more of a problem when the people around you are literally talking louder than the band on stage and distracting everyone around them.

I'm seeing a few bands this year that I'm really looking forward to and I'm worried they're going to be spoiled like these ones were. It's getting to the point where anxiety about a gig being spoiled by loud talkers is as bad as people pulling out phones or talking during the theatre.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/arjoc9/anybody_else_finding_people_talking_really_loudly/,1550402042.0,73,0.89,95,CasualUK,BootStampingOnAHuman

[Here](https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/8A776540-A6CA-484E-8712-6ACD9FBD9592) is a questionnaire-shaped experiment concerning funny English-like alien verbs. It contains 25 questions and instructions and it is aimed at English speakers. Also, it is meant to show how new verbs are acquired and to test a linguistic hypothesis. If you wanna take part, make sure you have 10-15 spare minutes.

As a side note, I built this experiment for my undergraduate dissertation at UCL and it has been conducted in other 3 languages as well.

Also, it may work better on a pc/laptop than mobile.

9k4mny,Anyone fancy seeding an urban legend to mess with teenagers?,"I remember back at school all the rumours about banana skins getting you high, even teabags were implicated.  There was a time when we all checked Mars Bar wrappers for evidence of being injected with poison, as we all knew the poisoned ones had been stamped with an X in the datecode area.  Kids believed stupid shit, and I don't see today's kids being any different (although I admit the internet might sour the fun).

I thought maybe we could spread new rumours, keep the cycle going, pass on the same dubious joy we had with playground folklore.  We could mention these ""facts"" she maybe get some traction on any good ones.

My contribution would be that to make the large £1 all chocolate flavor Aero bars they have to use a small amount of nitrous oxide, and if you crush a few bars up in an old bread bag and huff the vapours you'll get a short lived head rush.  I mean it sounds possibly plausible.  I'm starting to believe it myself already.

9jwxiz,Asian Hornets - please keep a lookout for these insects and/or their nests.,"Beekeepers, our honey bees and the country's native bees, need your help please. Sorry, this is a bit link-heavy.

An Asian Hornet nest has been found near Alresford, Hants, and destroyed. Another sighting on the coast to the west of Southampton is currently being investigated by staff from the [National Bee Unit](http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/public/News/news.cfm#211). Other confirmed sightings this year have been in Hull, Lincolnshire, and Cornwall - so these insects could be just about anywhere.

Could you keep an eye out because we really don't want them to get a foothold; they will decimate our colonies and other species of bees that nest in hollow trees etc.. They can also hurt people.  
http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/index.cfm?sectionid=117

More info about the hornet, plus links to two reporting apps and an online form, are on NNSS website.  
http://www.nonnativespecies.org//alerts/index.cfm?id=4

**Some identification info**  
These are not 'giant' Asian Hornets, they are smaller than the native European Hornet. A picture of an [Asian Hornet](http://www.planetepassion.eu/wildlife-in-france/Asian-Hornet-face-france.jpg) (Vespa velutina)

 She says your not meant to butter the toast before applying the Jam because it makes it taste funny. (Edit : She uses no butter at all) 

I say the butter is integral to the quality of the spread (and makes it taste better)

What are your thoughts? 

I love my girlfriend very much but this is the dividing line in our relationship and I can't see how we can go on with such different breakfast preferences

9j2o5e,"Those of us who read the Adrian Mole books as teenagers, and then again as adults, got two books for the price of one.","My mum gave me her copies of the first two Adrian Mole books when I was around 13 years old, roughly the same age as Adrian himself. I immediately fell in love with them and they were the first books to make me repeatedly laugh out loud. 

Of course, I viewed the entire story from the perspective of Adrian and agreed with his point of view the entire time - school, bullies, girls, puberty, etc. In some ways, I too was a teenager like Adrian - a bit pompous, thought I was more intelligent and worldly than I actually was, and extremely naive. When the next door neighbour, Mr Lucas, came over late at night to help Adrian's mother ""repair the boiler"" in the kitchen, and the door somehow got locked before they both emerged sweating, panting and half dressed, of course I agreed with Adrian that it would be messy work repairing a boiler! ;)

Then, of course, you go back and re-read them as a grown up, and a whole new world opens up. The themes of divorce, affairs, unemployment, politics, war, etc come through in ways that I didn't pick up on before. While I loved revisiting the old book, in some ways, it was also a whole new experience as I now picked up on the subtleties, jokes and double meanings that had gone over my head as a kid (ironically like Mole himself).

Did anyone else have a similar experience with the Mole books?

9irmmv,Housemate got me an interview with the Freemasons grand secretary next week.,"I'm pretty chuffed today because I've learned I have an interview with the Freemasons next Tuesday (after being introduced through a housemate who is also looking to join through a family member). If it's true that there are career perks in this, I'm hoping this could help in my job search.

Anyway, I was hoping for some advice on the questions on the application form (I need to send the form back today and will be asked about it at the interview).

**Occupation:(e.g., director, manager, technician, carpenter, shop assistant etc. Please state if self-employed / retired  etc**

My previous role was 'deli assistant' at Asda, but I am currently 'unemployed' which is not an option on the application form. Should I put 'deli assistant' or maybe 'self-employed' (as I've technically had my own business in the past year from selling stuff at the bus station/car boot)?

**Wife’s / Partner’s name**

I do not have a wife or partner, I'll just leave this section blank? Or are they looking for a female support as part of the application? I'm on better terms with my mum after the weekend, so I could put her down?

**Is your wife / partner happy for you to be a Freemason?**

Again, I don't have a wife or partner, do I leave blank or put mum's name?

**Do you believe in a Supreme Being? (e.g. God/Allah /Yaweh/Creator of the Universe, etc) YES / NO**

I'm mostly in the 'don't know' camp here, which isn't an option. Should I circle both boxes? Although I don't mind believing in a God if it helps my career, so I could just tick 'yes' and hope they don't ask too much about it at the interview.

**Why do you want to become a Freemason?**

Honestly, it's mostly because people on here said it can help with job perks/free plumbing/free holidays. But I figure it isn't good to put that, so I was thinking of saying something like 'because I believe and respect the legends, and want to join a brotherhood'. Any thoughts?

**What advantages do you see in becoming a Freemason?**

See above. 

**What do you expect to gain from Freemasonry?**

See above. I don't 'expect' to get career advantages and affordable tradeswork, but it would be very handy.

**There is a financial aspect to Freemasonry. Along with Dining fees and subscriptions, your annual cost may run up to £500 or more.  Are you {and your Wife/Partner} happy that this will not cause financial embarrassment to you or your family?**

This cost could be a problem, and I'd like to ask here what the cheapest subscription is (as I can't afford £500 a year, not for embarrassment reasons but because I need to eat/drink/pay mortgage). I guess this answer will depend on if I put mum's name down at my partner, because honestly she probably wouldn't be happy with me spending my money on this (as she lent me a bit on Sunday for essentials).

I'm trying to be careful with my answers, so any help on the application form would help a lot. Also, any advice on what to wear to the interview? I don't have a suit (I've got a white shirt and a dark denim coat that looks a bit like a suit jacket), but I have my old Asda uniform and I obviously have my normal clothes (T-shirts, jeans).

9htbxs,I seriously don’t understand the Great British Menu...,"Like why. I understand that it’s the 70th anniversary of the NHS but the chefs are just mental. The food feels just really standoffish even though it’s an important event. Like:


‘Steven has served a raw chicken tartare with a poached and flombayed rare purple ostrich egg on top. With it he has served a tree sap and alpaca spit reduction, which must be sipped through a single microherb to enhance the flavour, but not overpower it. Around the edge he dusts a horseradish and porcupine spike powder, and garnishes with a pine needle.’


The judges then absolutely love it despite the chalkiness of the alpaca spit. Then the sane person who was invited to judge is completely drowned out by the pretentious other judges, who talk about how the chicken could use a little more seasoning, however due to it being nice and moist they’d let it pass.

9hmuvr,British Cactus and Succulent Society,"Hi guys,

I recently took over the Twitter account for the British Cactus and Succulent Society (BCSS). We're a registered charity in England and Wales (though we do cover the entirety of the UK - I'm Glaswegian!) and I've been tasked with promoting the society internationally. We post daily photos of succulents and cacti, we have discussions, and we're always available to help out with any plant woes (or just show us your nice plants so we can fawn over them!). We have plans for open hours, giveaways, and other fun things in the near future.

If you think this sounds good, please consider following us @cactussucculent (www.twitter.com/cactussucculent). There's no requirement to join the society (although you're certainly welcome - you get free seeds, access to a cheap yearly seed repository, a quarterly journal, care guides, etc for £15 a year) and you don't have to be in Britain at all. Our society has been running in some form for over 50 years, and now we're taking it international!

Thank you!

PS: it's been suggested by mods that I do an AMA, do people want this?!

But what I don't understand is, other than the fun costume, what benefits there are to being a Freemason. Does it do deals with shops/restaurants for discounts or vouchers? Is it something that can go on the CV in the 'hobbies and interests' section?

&amp;nbsp;

Long story (for context) short; I’m self employed and on a very very low income (around £40/wk) which translates to £3.50/wk food budget. 

While a lot of my meals revolve around the standard rice/pasta:beans on toast, my previous partner taught me to cook several things well and in batch so they work out cheaper in the long run.

Many of these recipes are low-cost purely because the ingredients are cheap at Aldi. With wonky potatoes at £1.49 for 4 kg and similar, it all goes a lot further. Some of this stuff requires purchasing in pieces - it took me months to build a little spice rack up, buying one pot one month, maybe one the next when I had some spare in the budget. I’ve tried to keep it minimal in this list.

There are also some treats in this list. Cheesy garlic bread and oat and raisin cookies aren’t exactly essential to daily life, but bloody hell do they make things just that little bit nicer.

I hope some others are able to make use of these recipes, over time I’ve adapted them slightly for the benefit of a cheaper budget or to last\stretch longer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, just a little note. People here are -and have been- extraordinarily kind both to me and to others. Sometimes when I’ve spoken about things like this, very kind members of this community will offer to help; to send some food over or order up a pizza or similar.

I can’t begin to say how wonderful it is that people in this community would help out someone they don’t even know who might be struggling, but I always turn down such kind offers because there are so many people out there far more in need than I am. Homeless shelters are very close to my heart and are far, far more deserving of support than I. 

Or, if you happen to see a local food shelter collecting at your supermarket, maybe plop a tin or two of something in your trolley to make a real difference. As a single bloke, I’ve never felt comfortable taking food from a food bank; I feel I’m taking it from families and children who might need it more, so I don’t go if I’ve ever referred. But for some people, it really is a lifeline. Love to all.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, hope someone at least makes a nice pizza. Would love to see any other recipes we’ve got kicking about!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9h0xpb/student_low_income_heres_a_few_of_my_v_low_food/,1537321286.0,429,0.99,120,CasualUK,-SaC

9gix5u,Got locked in a funeral home in Cardiff last night.,"This happened at 00:30am last night and I'm only now just getting back to my actual home after a night of what I imagine a low budget horror film starts off like. 

So, I was driving to a postcode my friend gave me to pick them up in the middle of Cardiff and Google maps had trouble pinpointing the exact place, so I was driving up and down the road, which had a lot of traffic lights, roundabouts etc until I had the clever idea of skipping going through the lights for the fifth time and doing a u-turn in an open gated funeral home. Silly me.

By the time I drove into the grounds, around the building and attempted to join the main road again, I returned only to realise the gates had been padlocked shut. It took roughly 25-30 seconds for me to drive around the building so that is some swift locking going on by the person (who I later found out in the morning when the director knocked on my car window to find me in the foetal position in the back seats sleeping) who had finished storing the deceased, finishing their shift, locked up and went home.

As the funeral home (think big manor house with two guest houses) was enormous, I thought maybe somebody was in residence so I proceeded to knock and ring the doorbell for about 3 hours before giving up. My phone was low on battery (and I used the last of it to film my experience) and the walls were about 3 metres all the way round the perimeter so I couldn't scale them, and, what would be the point? 

I accepted my fate, had a before bed cigarette, wrapped my coat around me and slept in the back of my rather small two door car.

TL:DR: TIFU by trying to do a u-turn in private grounds (funeral home) at roughly midnight, ended up getting locked in, had to wait 8 hours to be let out by a bemused funeral director.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9gix5u/got_locked_in_a_funeral_home_in_cardiff_last_night/,1537177590.0,286,0.98,58,CasualUK,lukebilhamcarter

9gakdx,Anyone else feel quite impressed with our energy production sources recently? Right now during midday on a weekend over 40% of our electricity is coming from solar and wind! If you want to add Nuclear to that then right now around 70% of our energy production is causing ZERO bad emissions!,"[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/Ekb78Yu.png) a screenshot of our energy production sources right now, with a pie chart and everything. Source is http://grid.iamkate.com/ which updates every 5 mins or so.

I just think it's impressive and wanted to spread the news that's all, especially since it keeps rising at a pretty decent rate. It's not like it's a 1 off either, the average for the week for solar, wind, nuclear, and a couple other things like hydro power is at around 50% too. Makes the future look a bit more positive.

Looking at the graphs on that website in just 5 years things like solar and wind have more than doubled their energy production, imagine another double increase for the next 5 years. It helps that the amount of energy we're using is dropping quite a lot too, who would have thought?

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/ThwNSJ9.png) another image from Wikipedia showing our wind energy capacity and generation over the past 10 years. In short 10 years ago the capacity was 3GW which generated 5,300GWh, 5 years ago that was 11GW and 24,000GWh, and last year it was 19.8GW and 50,000GWh. That's like a 7x increase in capacity in 10 years. For some reason the prediction for the next 12 years is only 2x but that's most likely lowballing it since there's many big projects in the works, unless we might start spitting the focus with tidal power too.

Another cool wind farm stat is that we just opened a 650MW offshore wind farm a couple weeks ago and it's the largest in the world. But in a couple of years we're opening one almost TWICE as big. Then one even bigger in another 2 years. So it's not like the trend is only a temporary thing. I'm looking forward to seeing the stats in 5-10 years. 

But yeah I wasn't sure where to post this but it seems like the right place, it's definitely non politics UK based interesting content like the sidebar says.

9g07uj,CasualUK hits 200k!,"We have been a subreddit for something along the lines of 18 months now (13th of February 2017, 11:25am to be exact) and what a ride it's been. From a few people who just wanted a little corner of the internet to shitpost in we've grown at an incredible pace and gone from strength to strength in terms of content, memorable stories and events and grown into what we all like to think isn't just a subreddit anymore but more of a community, as cheesy as that sounds.

The people who make this place are you guys, so here's to you - thank you from all of us on the team for making this the place we all like to come back to day after day - from the people asking pertinent and stupid questions, users taking wonderful photographs, screengrabs of truly hilarious pieces of the internet for us to poke fun at, to the people sharing stupid news stories all the way up to the master baiters who draw some of us in and give the rest of us a damn fucking good chuckle - thank you. 

A big thank you too to all of you who have helped us to raise nearly £3,000 as a community for charities chosen by yourselves through our quarterly charity threads. We have raised staggering amounts for both Shelter and CALM, and our next nomination thread will be up within the coming weeks, so keep your eyes peeled! 

It doesn't feel like a milestone post without a bit of a round up, so here for some of you who may be new are some of our collective favourite posts.

9fghnj,Does selling stuff at a car boot count as 'work experience'?,"I've been getting no interest in my CV on Monster/Reed and I'm getting to the point where I *really* need a job (I'm pretty sure mum won't lend me money any more for bills/shopping/mortgage), and not helped that I had go thirds on a new microwave yesterday. The only job opening in town I've found is at Scope, but I asked if they'd pay me as I've got retail experience (and some very interesting ideas on how to promote their shop) but the lady in the back-room refused. So I want to try and add more 'skills, experience and achievements' on my CV to hopefully give me more chance to get interviews and actually be noticed on job websites.

The only thoughts I have right now (without outright lying about jobs, I'd rather not do that) is:

- I had a stall (well, a blanket and old sofa) at a local car boot earlier in the year. I technically didn't make money from it (after accounting for the cost of the pitch) but I was, in essence, manager of a small shop. Is this something I could add to my work experience or skills part of my CV?

- I've also bought things online, customised them, created professional posters/leaflets for them (marketing) and sold them to locals (car boot/bus station). Again, didn't technically make profit but I learned how to 'cold sell' to people and it felt like a business (of buying things at 'cost price' and selling them at a 'retail price', even if ultimately I had to discount nearly all of them). Is this something I could add to the CV?

- I was going to add a housemate's number as my 'reference' at a recent job (which won't give me a positive reference if I add their real number). Is that legal?

- I recently started learning a couple of coding languages (Java and python) but I found it pretty difficult and ended up giving up after a couple of weeks. I wasn't planning to add these to the CV, but is there an easier language I could learn that could be added? 

- I took off my year 9 SATs from my CV earlier in the year and I feel like I've been getting *less* interest since then, so I've re-added them back on for now (as they are the only qualifications I have achieved and every CV template I've seen has a qualifications section). I figure there are no free online courses I can take which could be added in the 'qualification' section of the CV (to replace my y9s's)? One job site I use is Reed and they have a 'free courses' page but I'm not sure if they are addable to a CV (and they haven't replied to my email).

- Are there any other 'skills or achievements' that people often add to a CV that don't take much work to do? I have looked to see if there's any marathons/half-marathons I can run locally (and get sponsorship) but I can't find any (I used to be pretty good at long distance running at school).

Thanks for any advice.

Edit: I've looked into taking a free GCSE, signed up to a free online Excel course, and added Asda reference back onto the CV (due to them not giving information other than start/end date), thanks again for all the advice so far.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9fghnj/does_selling_stuff_at_a_car_boot_count_as_work/,1536830596.0,90,0.84,104,CasualUK,TopTrumpWANKER

9ezt8g,The Great British Bake Off Week 3 - Bread Week! (11/09/2018),"Good evening and welcome to Bake Off's third episode live thread. This week is **Bread Week**, the week everyone dreads as our very own silver fox Paul Hollywood is the King of Bread (by his own appointment). Expect even more inscrutable looks than usual. Here’s a quick recap of last week…

First and foremost – we confirmed Kim-Joy was definitely a Redditor. Hello again, Kim-Joy!

In Baking related news, everyone’s favourite civil servant/techno DJ \#ladladlad from Sheffield was the unfortunate loser, serving up what looked quite a lot like a half melted snowman as his showstopper. Good try, but in the words of some dude, it was wank.

Rahul charmed us all and received a handshake for his showstopper, with solid signature and technical bakes, Rahul fully deserved it. However, he wasn’t the only recipient of a handshake, with both Dan and Ruby also receiving them for their technical and showstopper bakes respectively. I can only hope that this fuels their developing catty rivalry (\#TeamRuby). Paul Hollywood Handshake stock is at an all time low.

Finally, subreddit favourite Terry “Big Tel” Terryson is legitimately a dead man walking. How the hell he survived last week is anyone’s guess. Two terrible weeks in a row, in the bottom 3 in *every single bake* he’s done so far… Big Tel can’t be long for this world.

9ey4pe,"I endured the most English home invasion ever - four masked men brandishing crowbars stormed into my house and threatened to kill me, before apologising, shaking my hand and leaving.","Posting this here because I have no idea where else to post it... I may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. But if it entertains anyone today, then I suppose I have achieved something! The detail is pretty accurate, cos I made notes immediately after the event, and I've tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!

This occurred in 2015, otherwise known as the worst year of my life. It certainly wasn’t what Back To The Future had let me to expect.

After losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my BBQ exploding on my birthday gathering, I was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. It was August, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months…

I’d been up late watching It Follows, and not being much of a horror fan, I was suitably creeped out. And slightly high. My girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am I went up there too.

It’s probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. The ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. It’s one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy Sussex village.

I went to bed and was soon drifting off. About 15 minutes later I heard some banging. I didn’t pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. So I started to go back to sleep. The next memory I have is of shouting. Lots of shouting. The bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.

I remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. I also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. I thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. This led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.

So now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. Maybe five. Hard to tell, I didn't get to put my glasses on. My girlfriend is screaming, they’re all shouting, and I’m incredibly confused. The ringleader then demands that I give him the bag of money.

“What money!?” I asked.

“Give us the fucking bag of money, we know you’ve got the bag of money!” the ringleader repeats. Several times.

“I don’t have a bag of money,” I explained. It’s hard to remember the order of events, but I do know one thing for sure - Tom Cruise popped into my head.

The previous night I was watching Mission: Impossible 3. I do like that film, and I had it on in the background while I did the washing up. I remember pondering the scene where Ethan Hunt’s wife has a gun to her head. “I want to give you what you want, but you’ve got to do what’s right!” exclaimed Hunt. Hmmm. I wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. Is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?

Well, it apparently sewed a seed, because I found myself repeating those words.

“I don’t have a bag of money. I want to get you what you want, but you have to do what’s right and leave this poor girl alone,” are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.

“Yeah? Well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!” said the one I considered to be the sidekick.

“Nah nah nah, it was my sister,” said the ringleader in correction.

This exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.

For my neighbour is a drug dealer. A weird guy from Essex. He’s in his mid-30s, about 5’8” with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. He’s skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. He smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn’t enough to keep his energy in check.

Sometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. [Like the time he made a wooden triangle](https://i.imgur.com/2E6FGuw.jpg). Or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. You know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night.

Still, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, I wasn’t entirely keen on sending them next door. As much as I disliked my neighbour, I didn’t think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. So I continued to try and talk these people out of the house.

“I’m not a drug dealer, so I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. There’s a couple of Macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an iMac… whatever you want, just take it and go mate.”

Hearing this offer, the ringleader realised I was being compliant. And if I was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn’t I just give him the bag of money he was seeking? Slowly, the cogs turned.

“Is this number 27?” he demanded to know.

“The whole area is.”

“Yeah but is this number two, twenty seven Acacia Avenue?”

“No, it’s number one.”

“WE’VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!”

The realisation was startling. They all shouted. One guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. He had given up already. One or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my GF with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy I suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.

“Right, you can’t call the cops of we’ll come back. We know where you live!” The sidekick said.

Emboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, I laughed. “You seriously think I won’t call the cops? Best I can do is give you a thirty second head start.”

He didn’t like that, so he took my phone. Good, I thought. I’ll track that fucker. Sadly, I later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.

The ringleader then apologised. He said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. I said something along the lines of “well I am glad we sorted that out.” At which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my GF would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.

I picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. Which it almost was.

Little did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. But he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. My neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his GF, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.

“GO KID! GO KID! THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE!” He screamed.

“No shit,” I responded. “Why do you think my fucking door is wide open?”

I went out to meet him while talking to the police on my GF’s phone. He grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. I decided I was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.

It took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. Eventually, my GF and I cautiously walked down to the living room. The police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. So they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. It’s likely to be the only time I tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.

The rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. They were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. Turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. As the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.

“Go Kid! I just want to say one thing mate! I just want to say one thing!” He screamed.

“Neighbour, you’re not physically capable of saying just one thing.”

The police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. This humiliation would haunt him for some time.

Eventually I heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on Facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. A scumbag he’d recently connected with on FB. He gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. To the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn’t have the evidence to charge him.

About a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. “They terrorised us too!” he said. He then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, I presume, torturing him. He tried to show me some sort of video evidence but I refused to look at it. ""We have to look after our women!"" he said.

He then said that he was aware I had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. A bit bemused by this, I asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. This enraged him, and we haven't spoken a single word to each other since.

The only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my Leatherman (it had 'That's not a knife' engraved in it). Nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. I moved house this year, so I can only hope I never see my neighbour's face again.

TL:DR - Masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. Also, my neighbour is a knob.
