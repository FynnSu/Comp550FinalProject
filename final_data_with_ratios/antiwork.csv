qkqmdq,I am so sorry!,"I am on the younger end of the boomers, just turned 61.  I have only come to realize that I bought into the this mindset that work is everything. My whole life I have been told work hard and you will successful. Now in 1979, when I was 18 that could be the case. But I have never been a go getter. But I was always the good employee. Sure I can work those hours; I will scrub that floor; I will do everything in my power to make you, my boss, look good. 

Yeah what I have done my entire working life is to make the pockets of the Uber rich nice and deep.  

So now as I enter the last part of my working years, I don‚Äôt dare leave or rock the boat. But what I really want to say is‚Ä¶.I AM SO SORRY!   My generation has created this quagmire and most of us are too stupid to even realize. I hated the greed decade of the 80s. Well excepting the music. That was pretty fabulous. But we sure did screw up everything else. We used and abused all of ours resources leaving the next generation to pay. It is not fair. I am so angry.  My hope is your the generation to take control.

qkpmly,"Quit my job after the company I worked at shorted $200 off my paycheck and after the boss told me ‚ÄúI pay you minimum wage but if I could, I would pay you less‚Äù","As the title says. I quit my job when the company I worked at shorted $200 off my paycheck. When I noticed what was happening, I started arguing loudly with the person who shorted the $200 off my paycheck and with the supervisor and the secretary. They even made me feel guilty for an error they made on their part. Mind you, the place uses a magnetic card to clock-in and clock-out. So I knew I worked all week and this was an error made by the company. I went batshit and told the person ‚ÄúYou have to deposit the money you shorted at my account before 12 pm or else prepare for the worst‚Äù. So they took a while but they deposited the money before 12 pm. All of the employees were supporting me. But the shit really hit the fan when the company‚Äôs boss called me to his office to talk to me privately. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre making such a shit show, you‚Äôre one of the employees that we look after so much and besides, I pay you minimum wage but if I could, I would pay you less.‚Äù That made me feel like shit so I got out of his office and went to the manager‚Äôs office and told him that I was going to finish the rest of my work (1 hour of work) and that I was quitting immediately and was going to send him my resignation letter via email and I was going to pick up my last paycheck at the end of the week. And so I left that place. Four days later the company‚Äôs boss called me begging me to come back, which I didn‚Äôt. I now have a better job that pays much more than them.

Update: Thank you guys for all the amazing feedback! I never expected this to blow up like it did, that‚Äôs awesome! I don‚Äôt understand some people here saying that I made this up, why would I make this up? Why would somebody share a hellish experience like this if it was fake? Somehow they miss the part where I got a better job that pays much more. I sincerely hope that no one has to go through something like this. I have all the evidence to prove that this is real. I‚Äôm sharing this with everyone so that they can stand up for themselves if they‚Äôre actually experiencing something similar. You‚Äôre not the company‚Äôs property, they don‚Äôt have any power over you and you don‚Äôt have to be manipulated by anyone so please, stand up for yourselves! Additional details: This happened at a metal factory, the type of work there is production. The minimum wage in my area is $7.25, I was being paid $7.25.

Update 2: There seems to be some redditors that are actually not reading the part where management tried to pin their mistake on me. I tried talking to them calmly until they tried to pin their mistake on me. I was mad because I used their magnetic key card system to clock-in and clock-out all week and I even had to take my temperature with someone waiting at the front door of the factory every day, that guy logged in the temperature information on a notebook that showed that I worked every day of the week. Please read the post carefully before accusing me of overreacting to ‚Äúan honest mistake‚Äù which is clearly not what happened here. Management tried to pin their mistake on me and tried to make me feel guilty for something I did not do when I clearly clocked-in 5 minutes early every day and logged my temperature info on a notebook. This is not a fake story, why would I waste my time making this shit up? Do you really believe that this type of shit doesn‚Äôt happen? Don‚Äôt be a company mogul, stand up for yourselves and stand up against abuse and derogatory comments. I will not be answering comments like ‚ÄúThis is fake‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou got mad and they fixed the mistake‚Äù anymore, that is not the point of this post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qkpmly/quit_my_job_after_the_company_i_worked_at_shorted/,1635805889.0,6166,0.97,287,antiwork,Comfortable-Speed-47

qkl9xt,I refused to cancel my vacation last minute and got fired for it,"
A few years ago I had a job at a health care facility that was run by the most evil woman I have ever met (she constantly bragged about how unempathetic she was). I had worked there on a contract for about 10 months and it was supposed to be renewed in April. Since my friends and I had to schedule our vacations way ahead of time, I figured ""I might as well put in my vacation request for June even though my contract will be up by then and I might not be working here... Atleast if I am they will have notice"". I put in my notice for a vacation week in June by FEBRUARY.

April came and went and leading up and afterwards I kept asking cruella devile when they will give me an extension on my contract or what. They kept stringing me along. Whatever. I was making fairly good money and I loved my coworkers.

It came to end of May, 3 days before I was supposed to be going on vacation. The schedule showed me on vacation. The hours I had been covering (I was only supposed to be pt on weekends but I had been scheduled 6 days a week for months) was covered and I was looking forward to my vacation week.

Cruella came up to me while I was on break and she said ""Im not approving your vacation request"". I asked her what she meant, since I was already booked off, and everything had been rearranged on the schedule already. She insisted that she didn't approve it so I wasn't allowed to take it.

Me- but I put this request in February. 

Her- I don't care

 Me- but I already paid a deposit on the cottage 

Her- not my fault you wasted money. You're not allowed to go.

I realized she was just a fucking bitch and wanted to try and control me. So instead, in the most deadpan way to say:

""Elizabeth. I put this notice in for February. I paid a deposit and I'm only supposed to be working on weekends and you haven't said anything about extending my contract for weeks. I'm sorry Elizabeth but I'm going on my vacation""

She got up in silence in left. 2 days later they called me into hr and fired me (""were deciding not to extend my contract""). My manager left the room while her best friend hr lady explained I'd be paid the next 2 weeks for not giving me any notice. I was secretly recording this meeting so I made sure to mention ""I've been working 6 days a week since I was hired. I'm being paid that for the next 2 weeks right?""

She agreed and gave me a taxi coupon to go home. I tipped him $50 and had the best summer off",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qkl9xt/i_refused_to_cancel_my_vacation_last_minute_and/,1635793904.0,552,0.99,18,antiwork,DogsnChickens

qkkynd,"Let's stop calling fast food employees ""burger flippers""","What the title says. Demeaning the work someone else does is is antithetical to the antiwork movement. All labor is skilled, and all jobs have dignity. From a janitor to a CEO, all work requires skill and all workers deserve respect. Not to mention that, at least in America, basically all supposedly ""skilled"" labor is behind a paywall of continued education.

Working in fast food is NOT just ""flipping burgers,"" and y'all should know better if you're here. Working in dining involves long, hard hours. The work is physically demanding and the client-facing aspect of the role is emotionally taxing. Fast food workers get paid peanuts to do some of the hardest, most disrespected work out there. Don't shit on the little guy to make yourself feel big.

q208c8,Boss just exposed they're trying to force us to quit and now wants step by step procedures of all everything we do,"My workplace went from being tolerable in covid to being a hostile return to office.

Every piece of flexibility is being removed on a weekly basis starting with telecommuting, flex hours, pto reductions, and paycuts.

All while our ceo sucks his own ego by paying himself million dollar bonuses, buying ""Most influential person in all of healthcare"" awards (this is  BCBS Healthcare Service Corporation), and sharing podcasts where he talks about his favorite candy and ""how it influences his work and personal life""

I was on a call with our manager and senior vice president, who must have not realized he had employees on the call. He literally said ""we've lost a lot of people but still aren't at our expected attrition rate yet. Once we get there, we can shift gears for plans on the rest of 2021"".

Expected attrition rate? Are you fucking kidding me?? 

Next meeting. My boss tells us every holiday and pto day we take will be deducted from our work from home bank and we are expected to work a minimum of 8 hours in office. Were salary,, not hourly. We aren't even allowed to book meeting rooms due to covid. Then she talks to us individually about creating procedures about all of our tasks and says that she will be meeting on a weekly basis to ensure they're accurate and detailed enough.

Then this cunt has the nerve to say ""I'm not a micromanager, so if you need extra time, let me know and I can see about giving you an extension. I really appreciate all you do and couldn't imagine a better team!""

These morons made astronomical amounts of money from covid. Literally had Money for Nothing playing in the background during one town hall with a chart showing billions gained per month due to covid19 impact.

Now they're acting like it's too much to pay severance because they want to lay people off.

I'm done with this shit company, my way out will be sabotaging these 'procedures' and dragging what I can down with me. Have fun paying me more just to avoid severance packages your greedy scum. 

Have fun dealing with the offshore replacement breaking your systems when you finally do cut me off.

q205q0,"I received a pay cut ""as a token of appreciation"" for my work as a Healthcare worker during the pandemic. The top 6 earners at my company gave themselves $80 million in raises this year while taking away their employees bonuses.","Been here for 12 years, started 3 months after I graduated high school. I did everything I was supposed to do. I worked hard, I got licenses and certificates and jumped through every hoop. 5 family members died during the pandemic and I didn't even have time to grieve them because I was filling in at every location that was short staffed, helping with vaccination clinics, working on my days off, etc. I burned myself out until I had a suicidal episode and took a leave of absence. Since I came back(August 18th), corporate has removed our surge pay, took away 4 annual bonuses, promised new bonuses that they didn't pay out, and increased our operating hours but hasn't gotten more employees to cover those we've lost, much less to cover the longer hours. They did give the most of the employees a $1 raise, but my surge pay was $1.59, so a lot of us ended up with a pay cut. Also, that $1 raise doesn't even cover the bonuses they took away. Meanwhile, the CEO gave himself a 23 million dollar raise this year. 

I was just written up for a medical condition (not related to my LOA) that I have FMLA for, and was told that my employees (I'm in a management position) are ""upset that I've been getting special treatment since I returned from my leave."" That special treatment is an extra 10 minutes on lunch or an extra 10 minute break here and there when I have a sensory overload or a panic attack.

I do well at my job, get twice the sales the other guys do.

Boss tells me I'm fired because I'm being disloyal looking for another job. I tell him he's being totally unprofessional and illogical and ask to at least meet to talk.

He rants more about loyalty and tells me it won't work out so I tell him to fuck off and hung up.

Then you have a company wide meeting where one of the managers has to present something. Of course this manager has technical issues so we watch him for 20 minutes trying to fix his presentation, which he could have easily done before the meeting.

Lets see, we are around 26 people without the manager, watching him for 20 minutes. 20\* 26 = 520 minutes. Which is a little over 8 and a half hours of company time he just wasted. So just remember this guys, think about how much time management is actually wasting. So don't feel bad if you take a longer break or slack off.

Also, it would take several months to train someone new.

Without going into the boring details, I've had a worse experience at this company than I have had at any other, which says a LOT. And I worked *hard* here. And they repaid me with nothing but disrespect, disregard, and incompetence.

My boss lives in another time zone, so I'm waiting for her to get on the clock before I tell her.

I have a couple of other things in the works and enough savings that I have a little bit of time to find something else if those don't work out.

Thought you guys would be the one to share it with.

Have a good day, everyone!

Edit: I have a couple of pending job opportunities. If they don't work out, I have a few months of savings. My partner is financially secure enough that, if my savings run out, I could get a part-time or minimum-wage job to keep us afloat while I look for something better.

q1s9dw,I just quit with no plan or backup. I've not felt this good in years.,"I know there are a lot of posts like this, but I'm so full of joy that I feel like I'm likely to burst at the seams, and I just really want to share with a group that might understand.

Last week was my yearly vacation, and on its first day, I got a call on my personal number from one of my bosses, who then proceeded to chew me out for what amounts to... essentially just me doing my job. (It's a long and meaningless story- in short, because sadly I can't be in two places at once, I needed to make a decision of which of two tasks is more important. I chose to do the more important one that also happened to be time-sensitive, but according to the leadership, having only one body is a personal shortcoming of mine that can be overcome through hard work, force of will, and unpaid overtime, naturally.)

I know I shouldn't have picked up, but that call (which included such delightful things as him telling me to *""not play the martyr, figure it out""*, as well as the classic threat of *""if you can't handle it, we can easily find someone else""* and *""if it wasn't for (other department), I would have already shut that branch down""*) kickstated in me a thought that, throughout my week off, had plenty of time to snowball. I listed pros and cons, I spoke to my family, and everyone agreed- it's been a long time coming, and there's not going to be a better time for years and years.

In my country, 30 days is the mandatory notice one has to give when quitting, so on my very first day back (yesterday), I submitted my notice. Immediately, it's like a weight that I didn't even fully realize was on me was lifted off my shoulders. I'm totally zen.

I of course got the pleading calls right away, the whole faux-mopey, manipulative act from the owner (*""aw, I wish you could stay, you're such a great employee"", ""please, tell me how we could do better for you"", ""we're so sorry that it has come to this, are you sure"" ""it's going to be so hard to replace someone like you!""* \- weird that his immediate underling didn't get that memo), but nah. I'm done. I've been done a long time, but this time, it's in writing.

They have roughly two weeks to find someone to replace me (and that someone needs to speak three languages, be well-versed in legal jargon, be willing to work for peanuts, and be able to start *immediately*), if they want them to receive any kind of training from me at all.

If you can so easily find someone else, okay. Be my guest. Do so.

ptgm4t,My manager surprised me this morning,"I just graduated and after countless interviews finally landed a position at a financial institution. My friends have been sharing their stories of demanding managers and stressful hours.  The recruiting process was odd as my manager was busy and never present during the interviews, but I met with his boss a few times. It flew a red flag but I really needed this job. 

I started on Monday and I finally met my manager over a video call. He pops up with a ball cap and T-shirt, and I‚Äôm dressed in the proper dress code attire. He explains to me that he‚Äôs anti-corporate, ‚Äúwork when you want‚Äù, ‚Äúdress how you want‚Äù, ‚Äúlet me know how I can help you succeed.‚Äù  He introduced me to my team and they on boarded me.  The team said my manager is easy-going, will never call anybody out in public, will stand up for the team to management, has fought hard for better tools, and always wants the team to be more successful than him.  

On Tuesday, I remembered I had a doctor‚Äôs appointment. I thought my manager would freak out because I didn‚Äôt give him enough notice and I would need to reschedule. 

I called him to let him know about the appointment. He said ‚ÄúOk, no big deal. Don‚Äôt worry about. Just mark it on your calendar as Out of Office. ‚Äú. I was worried about using my PTO because I had not accumulated any. He said ‚ÄúNo don‚Äôt worry about that. What is it? Two hours?  You are fine. Just mark it on your calendar. The most important part is supporting the team.‚Äù

I went to my appointment. He checked on me. ‚ÄúHey you having fun?  What can I do to make you successful?‚Äù

hufgp8,I have done what I'm suppose to do to (somehow) escape the rat race... And I still feel anxious and guilty?,"I have worked for years. And this year is the year I finally paid off my debt, made an investment and put up my parents old house for rent (my parents have another house in which they live in). Below market price, trust me. I know the pain of paying nonsense rental prices.

So the money that I made each month (without any salary) is enough to cover food for myself, bills, gas for my car, insurance, a bit of savings and a bit of allowance I wish to give to my parents. 

I'm not gonna be a multi-millionaire anytime soon, nor will I be traveling around the world or buying a boat. But I can get by without a 9-5 job. 

Yet... My parents look at me disapprovingly when I told them about this. They said it's good that I make some money on the side, but i should just keep on climbing the career ladder and I can have double or triple the money I make now.

My old friends look at me like I'm being weak or giving up on life. They keep telling me that I will regret this decision to leave my career.

My colleagues just think I'm lazy, selfish and a traitor to the company.

The girl that I'm dating thinks that, if I go ahead with this decision, then I'm some sort of a bum who's gonna be homeless soon.

In reality, I'm doing this (letting go of my career and finding other pursuits in life while sustaining myself through my investments and rental) because I'm tired. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. I'm sick of having breakdowns every other week. I'm sick of feeling my heart beat rising and having to deal with anxiety at the workplace.

I want to sleep. I want to enjoy my days. I wanna plant some trees. I want to read books. I want to find my passion in life (which I have no idea what because I grew up thinking I need to work in an office to be successful).

But maybe I've been brainwashed since I was a kid. So even knowing that I have enough money to support myself, I still feel so anxious and so guilty to let go of my job. The pressure from the people around me doesn't help either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hufgp8/i_have_done_what_im_suppose_to_do_to_somehow/,1595222007.0,201,0.96,49,antiwork,SphmrSlmp

hqzrzd,I am a Japanese college graduate who started a career as a salaryman 3 months ago.,"I‚Äôm a fresh grad just stared my career as a salaryman 3 months ago. During the pandemic, my company was „Éõ„ÉØ„Ç§„Éà(""white"" as we call a ""employee caring company"" white company in Japan.)enough to let their new employees work from home pretty much doing nothing (other than copying their company policy which is about 200 pages by HAND). 
As the number of infections lowered in May, I started going into the office to start my training. the training went fairly well. I felt accomplished as I learned new things and got tasks done. 

But it just feels draining. Draining in the way that it feels like it‚Äôs limiting me from thinking freely. There are so many things that are ‚Äújust how it is‚Äù and i‚Äôm starting to find myself thinking ‚Äúoh well that‚Äôs just how it is‚Äù and not fixing or pointing out the flaws even when it‚Äôs in my reach.

Every day and night, on the train between my home and work, I see other salarymen cramped up in the train (as well as myself), presumably have done so for the last decade. And it gives me such an anxiety that I might lose all the creativity and critical attitude towards my uncomfortable comfort zone day by day.

hcvb9j,Told my boss to go fuck himself today.,"I'm really into backpacking and I like to take a long weekend sometimes to go on a three night trek. I'm an electrician and I was doing overtime today. I was planning on doing one of those three night treks just over a month from. So I stop in the shop after work and my employer is there so I very kindly say I'm gonna take ONE day off one MONTH from now after having just given him one extra day of my time. He says he can't do that cause he might need me. No again I'm an electrician and the company is not busy at all right now and even if it was, my missing one day of work won't stop production it just means the crew will get slightly less done that day because I'm not there. So anyways I told him I wasn't asking and to go fuck himself and then quit without a two week notice. Guess now I'll be doing the whole long trail for a few weeks so I ain't complaining now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

May seem a bit harsh to tell him to go fuck himself but he is an INCREDIBLY controlling boss who cheaps out on us every oppurtunity he gets. Once some of the guys got in a car crash on the way to work because he sends them so far away sometimes that they have to drive at 3:30 in the morning and fell asleep. (we also don't get travel lat for going two hours+ one way every day) Fortunately noone got too hurt but they were bruised up and first thing he said after asking if everyone was ok was that he would really appreciate it if they went to work today.

h0z8kq,What am I supposed to do? Make money for others then die.,"Venting.

Birth

Go to school to get just enough education to be a functional cog in profit machine

Get a job that barely pays enough to put a roof over your head and put food on the table (*if you're lucky*).

Make company tons of money while you never save a dime because anything you need in life is price gouged to maximize profits for whatever company it's from.

Make babies so they can grow up to be more cogs in the machine.

At best you scrape by until you die on an assembly line or at your desk or doing whatever job your corporate overlords have allowed you to ascend to while giving you the lowest, most insignificant raise possible.

This is life unless you were born into wealth, hit the metaphorical lottery with some invention or literally make every single right decision for the short and the long term even though your parents don't have the answers for how to escape this hellscape and your brain isn't fully developed until your mid 20's.

Socialism for the rich. Rugged individualism for the poor. Birth is a promise of profits for your future company and death is your retirement.

We are fucking cogs. We're fucking lemmings. At this point we're here for no other reason than to throw human effort and misery into the profit machine so the CEO can buy a new private jet or buy another house.

Look at the lives of the upper crust of society, the rich and powerful. Now look at how you're living. You work your whole life while the rich and powerful enjoy all the fruits of your labor.

The American Dream is dead. The constitution should go as follows.

You have the right to make profits for the company of your choice, make new workers never fully enjoy your life, get by on the bare minimum and then die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/h0z8kq/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_make_money_for_others/,1591881831.0,180,0.98,36,antiwork,Scioto_

gzyva6,We're wasting the one chance we may ever get in our lives to protest and strike against modern indentured servitude.,"We are in the midst of a pandemic. The system is in shambles. Some face a dilemma: starve, or potentially send themselves to their death, AKA COVID-19 filled workplaces, in order to put food on the table.

This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Our one chance to kick the enemy while they're down. They realize now, more than ever, that they are nothing without our labor. They are constantly trying to manipulate us into ""reopening the economy"" and ""getting back to work"" whether it's through misinformation about the virus, cutting off unemployment insurance, or who knows what else.

This is an insanely rare opportunity. They are begging for us back, desperately leaning on the support of our poor essential workers. Elon Musk had to threaten his city officials to get his workers back. We need to kick him while he's down. Not just him - the universal him. We must refuse. Once we go ""back to normal,"" this window of opportunity will close, most likely until we die of old age.

Instead of protesting and going on strikes to end wage slavery, the masses are fixating upon one of the many issues in our system: systemic racism. Yes, black lives matter. But are people seriously putting their lives on the line to speak out on that one, singular issue, when they could be fighting against so much more in addition? Against the wealth gap? Against modern indentured servitude? Nope, they're eager to get back to their beloved jobs that they feel ""lucky to have."" They ""miss"" their jobs dearly.

Wage slavery affects all of us, whether we see it or not. All races, ages, genders, etc. Except for the billionaires and multi-millionaires who are hoarding wealth. The 1%.

If people are going to protest, I think they should protest the big-picture injustice we all face *while they're at it.*

People should be going on strike for a **25-hour work week**. For **universal healthcare**. For a **minimum of 1-month PTO**. At this time, these strikes could actually work. If all essential workers go on strike and the large corporations have literally no one for a period of time, I could actually see them budging. No bail-out, no matter how much cash it is, could save them from that. Giving into our terms or at least negotiating would be the only way they could stop a full-blown, anarchistic collapse and the greatest depression to be seen in history.

It's too bad we've been blessed with this unique opportunity at a time during which the masses are too blind to see that their employer is their enemy. They only see the obvious enemy: corrupt cops. But the sly, disguised enemy, their employer, still has them under the spell of corporate stockholm syndrome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gzyva6/were_wasting_the_one_chance_we_may_ever_get_in/,1591744824.0,84,0.94,8,antiwork,tjacob638245
gznhxy,My anti-work attitude got me in the hot seat with my boss.,"I work a 8-4:30 shift M-F.  I am currently working from home.  This all happened pre-covid.

I was working in the normal office setting, but I oversee essentially what is a free clinic every Thursday.  I don't do much (as I'm not a clinical person), but I will occasionally stick around for the entire clinic if they are short staffed and I can help with check ins/running meds back and forth/etc.  On these days, my schedule is usually 8-8.  I've been regularly taking Friday afternoons off, if all my work is done, because I worked a 12 hour shift the day before.  If my work isn't done, or if I have meetings, I'll stick around until I'm done with my day.   For the most part, I've left around 2:30 or 3:30 most days when I have worked the extra hours the day before.

My attitude has always been: I'm an adult, my work is done, I'm salaried, there is no requirement to be in the office, I'm on the leadership team, why should I have to stay and putz around for an extra 2-3 hours when I've already hit 40?  This was working just fine, until my new boss started.

My new boss saw me doing this and immediately put a squash to it.  Told me I had to ask permission.  So I maliciously complied, and every Monday I started requesting Friday afternoons off, since I was working 12 hour shifts on Thursday.  He got snappy one week, and asked me why I needed to be out of the office on Friday afternoon?

I walked over to his office, and said, ""Frankly, that's none of your business what I do with my time off"".

We then had to have a mediation meeting where he told me that 40 hours is a minimum, and I should never ""expect"" to get flex time and I needed to stop requesting Friday afternoons off.  I told him that was not the attitude that the CEO wanted for his team (the CEO is pretty progressive, but personal friends with my boss).   My boss told me that flex time doesn't mean I can be flexible with my schedule, and I wanted to scream.

The next two meetings we had as a leadership team, the CEO was talking and asking on how we become a more flexible place to work so we can retain staff and be a desirable workplace.  I almost hit my head against the table.

Our turn over rate is something like 35% YOY.  I wonder fuckin why.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gznhxy/my_antiwork_attitude_got_me_in_the_hot_seat_with/,1591710579.0,138,0.99,29,antiwork,charlesdickens2007

gzm7ze,"Do the ""back to normal"" brigade annoy you?","Because they really annoy me. There was absolutely nothing normal about the before times from the not so long, long ago. Although I recognise the tragedy of the pandemic, the lockdown was sweet! However people/society are in such a rush to resume this abnormality that they value so much. The shops opened where I am yesterday and they were stampeded by consumers. IKEA had queues. I once checked out IKEA to see what all the fuss was about and instantly hated it with every fibre of my being, I wanted out of there immediately, the furniture sucks too. It was like a George Romero film watching zombies shuffle in fluorescent lit, uniform white rooms/halls with the all the accoutrements of a pseudo comfortable, middle class, suburbanite ideal. (In much the same way I watched Transformers 3, having not seen any Transformer films prior to this, to see what all the fuss was about and HATED it, wanting out of the cinema theatre after 30 minutes). People were getting excited about spending the whole day at IKEA the night before the lifting of restrictions. Literally what the actual fuck. I AM on a different planet to these people. These are the same people who want to work 9-5, Monday to Friday. Absolutely nothing has been learned from this experience. Consumerism is still in effect, capitalism will resume operations, pollution/climate change/species extinction/factory farming will bounce back. I want all these things GONE and it's about fucking time too, but no, THE SOCIETY PREVAILS.

EDIT: Another thing about ""back to normal"", it has a redolent whiff of religiosity like the statements you would hear in the 90s about ""moral values"" etc, made by people in response to those Satanic rockers etc. Just another reason to hate ""normal"".

EDIT 1: And one more thing, talk about double standards! I had zero issues adapting to the lockdown. I greatly enjoyed the absence of traffic on the roads, the lack of crowding and the freedom of it. However I'm an introvert yet extroverted people were complaining within 2 weeks about the restrictions and constantly calling for them to be lifted or just outright violating them, thereby endangering everyone else! Again fuck these double standards, extroverts and early waking people wouldn't be able to tolerate an introverted, night shift one yet we have to adapt to their system, FUCK THEM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gzm7ze/do_the_back_to_normal_brigade_annoy_you/,1591705903.0,238,0.97,50,antiwork,TheCassiniProjekt

I was already upset because my hours were bumped up to 40 a week (I'm a full time student and I have a few disabilities), but this just sealed it for me. I have PTSD. Being screamed at aggravates it. I spent my two days off scared and angry. Not the first time they rewarded someone for doing this to me, but it was the last straw.

I had a breakdown and kind of freaked out on someone here. Not angrily, but I just descended into a panic. They were so damn accepting and kind. If you're reading this, you're a real one.

Anyway, I'm done with it. I have savings to last me over a year if I'm not an idiot. Maybe two if I'm smart about it.

Don't know where to go from here, but I'm so happy I'm almost out. Gonna just work on my passions and see where it leads me. I love to write. Maybe I can do that if I can find my footing.

This subreddit has done wonders for my self esteem. It's scary to actively think about how bad our modern work culture is, but there's something gratifying about being told that you deserve better.

07:00 - Wake up

08:00 ‚Äì Work

I seem to do better on 9 or even 10 hours

Not getting exercise is not a good idea so whether it is the gym or a jog or yoga or whatever, ideally you should set aside at least 30 minutes for that a day I think - that should not be cut off to open up more time

All this would be worse and I would have essentially NO time if full time work included an hour or more of commute with car or train - I am not capable of remotely accepting this type of existence even in the slightest.

Now for someone who thinks that around 80 percent of modern jobs and 80 percent of the economy generally is utter nonsense and destructive bullshit and a waste of human life - you tell me how seizing to exist entirely is not preferable from a rational point of view if being forced to ""live"" this way is the only way to avoid homelessness and starvation?

The world is wrong. The world is incorrect. Modern human life and the way it is organized and the requirements for being allowed to be alive and have shelter and food - is all a mistake. It ought not to be this way. People who are OK with this are mentally ill and it's all a very insane thing going on.

Human beings being forced to do unpleasant, stupid, destructive, manipulative, nonsensical things for 8 hours a day in order to be allowed to be alive is in no uncertain terms = the stuff of nightmares and any sensible rational human being faced with this state of affairs would wholeheartedly despise being alive under this system with every fiber of their being, to put it mildly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gyx6ij/full_time_work_does_not_leave_you_with_much_free/,1591613756.0,109,0.99,46,antiwork,Waja_wurr90

It's fucking stupid that I can't take a few minutes at the start of my shift to eat a goddamn breakfast burrito due to my schedule being so locked in a death grip of work, studies, helping my family, personal chores/errands and just trying not to let bipolar and PTSD wreck me that I literally have no time to eat when I get up and still get at least 7 hours of sleep. Which I tend not to, leading to things like me yelling at you when you interrupt me while I'm talking.

It's fucking stupid that I'm supposed to care about the company ""losing money"" when I don't make enough to live on my own, get no benefits, and the Galaxy Business Brains at corporate ordered you whip-crackers to cut my hours to deal with a dip in sales that happens literally every winter yet still leaves the company with billions (I work at a hardware store chain, the blue one).

That's not your problem? Never said it was, wouldn't be one at all if you'd find something better to do. But thanks for putting that ""We're family, here!"" nonsense to bed.

I do take long breaks. Because there's nothing to do after 2 hours, and pretending to be busy under said condition is also fucking stupid. There's only so many trash cans to be taken out, floors to sweep and shopping carts to recover.

But whatever, you win. I need a job with a shift that lets me struggle to focus and remember things in a networking class at trade school, so I'll just scarf down a shit sandwich for breakfast instead. Won't need to microwave it, so I can probably slam it just before I clock in. Speaking of eating shit, do you put sauce on the ceo's shoes or do you prefer your dog turds plain? 

Now stop talking to me and let me toil in autopilot while daydreaming about automation taking most people's jobs, leading to either the time of my life or just dying higher than a runaway balloon in Denver, knowing that I won't miss anything.

Tldr: Fuck managers and everyone higher up who takes ""time theft"" seriously. You're stealing my time with demeaning and unrewarding bullshit, but I don't hassle you for it.

dst4nw,"How come most of society is so willfully ignorant, does time just beat us into complacency?","I mean, I‚Äôm a 26 year old male. I got my workers permit at 14-15 and worked ever since. But over these last few years, it kind of hit me harder than ever, the pressure of what the fuck am I doing with my life, one may call it a ‚Äúquarter life crisis‚Äù. It‚Äôs almost as if we are born and FORCED into a life that almost everything depends on this magical thing called MONEY that spins all of the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world.

I feel like almost 80% of jobs are monotonous and repetitive and you have to almost forcefully dumb yourself down to convince yourself you‚Äôre making an impact.

But, like, that impact, for our quote on quote ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are people we don‚Äôt even know. Strangers we have no connection to. We evolved in deeply connected tribes where everyone you knew and mattered to you and was a part of your team, even if you didn‚Äôt like them. Now, we all work with strangers, are surrounded by strangers on a daily basis, and it feels like everyone is simply out for their own, to get head, to make more money.

I can‚Äôt seem to see, how older people, who have been in the work force for so long don‚Äôt stop and think what in the FUCK am I doing!? My ONE life. My ONE existence. I spend HALF if not MORE sleeping, working, commuting, preparing for the next day etc. it‚Äôs like our own lives, where we actually get to love, laugh, create, relax, BE HUMAN is such a small portion of out actual one existence before we disappear into blackness and nothingness. 

I‚Äôve worked in machine shops, I recently got hired and quit my first day at a factory that made...bottle caps. Fucking bottle caps. PLASTIC. Any free moment I had, I would look up, almost screaming for help internally at all the people who seemed content, satisfied, even proud to be there, a good ol fashioned ‚Äúhard worker‚Äù. Which to me, seems like an adaptation people had to make in order to live with themselves doing back breaking work for shit pay. Literally, the job was working a line, where this machine spit out bottle caps so fast you couldn‚Äôt see them, and it never stopped. On break, someone had to replace you. You couldn‚Äôt stop. Just bagging boxes, taping them, labeling them, putting them on a pallet, and trying to keep up with the conveyor as the boxes kept filling. I stopped, in the moments I could, looking at my fellow humans, some old, some young..just like..what the fuck are we doing? We are replaceable robots filling boxes with caps. But unfortunately this type of work is a commonplace for many. So we leave exhausted, to do it again tomorrow, to hardly get by on our bills, only to have a day or two off, to sleep and do it again. 

So people ask, why are we all on anti depressants?
Why is mental illness so fucking rampant?
Why is suicide so sky rocketed?
Why are there mass shooters?
Why does everyone look for escaping in drugs and alcohol?

I think from this post alone, you know exactly why.

How can we be aware of our own demise our own death and spend so much time just trying to simply survive. Are people just blissfully ignorant to the system we are apart of?

The funny thing is, this is all new. Industrialization, is so new, couple hundred generations?

For millions of years we existed in a much different way. We are living against our own nature. It is making us sick.

And you, reader, me, writer, this is our one life. Our one experience on Earth, and it‚Äôs spent stressed, worried, working ourselves exhausted..just. To. Live.

Fuck me.

Again, I don't know the provenance of this shirt, but I'm so fucking tired of companies acting like this sort of attitude is healthy or necessary to work minimum wage jobs that are understaffed and fucking *hard*. I don't want these workers to be obsessed with me; I want them well-paid, well-staffed, and with a good work-life balance. To suggest that *customers* are the reason they come to work every day is ludicrous. People are there for money; they are there because in many cases they have no other choice. They are often not happy in their jobs and don't care about customers. I don't expect them to, given the work environments that exist currently.

dryei5,The absurdity of advice to marginalised groups in the workplace.,"Sometimes I read about the problems in the tech industry with women and people of colour being assumed inferior and  harassed or excluded from the best projects, and blocked from progressing in their careers by their racist and sexist managers or coworkers.

The advice to women and people of colour is: ""forget them, put your head down and work twice as hard as the people around you to prove that you're more skilled than them.""

What? So the company made a decision to hire and reward racist and sexist people who harass you, and you're supposed to turn around and thank the company for that racism and sexism by working twice as hard to raise their profits and output?

drq0lp,Don't ask about salary during an interview,"So I don't even know where to begin about the hypocrisy and absurdity of job interviews, and their inefficacy to pick up a good candidate with integrity.

One of the things that thousands of interview coaches and books written on the subject repeat mindlessly without critical thinking is ""don't ask about salary"". Why not? ""Because that will demonstrate you're more interested in personal gain than the job"". 

In other words you're more interested in your personal wellbeing than the wellbeing and wealth of our shareholders. And that is not acceptable in capitalism. 

How absurd, unfair, unethical and exploitative that you have to invest time, money and emotions in the job application, tests and interviews only to find out what the salary is AFTER you get the pathetic job.

What kind of an imbecile would not be interested in personal gain and wellbeing over that of some anonymous billionaires?

Why does the whole system has to be so hypocritical and cruel?

drhchz,Expensive and time-consuming commutes should be paid for by the company.,"Hi Everyone. AntiWork Lurker, first time poster. I‚Äôm sitting on my train to work right now feeling bitter and resentful about my commute. So I thought I‚Äôd get this off my chest and see how everyone here feels about it. I work in New York City and take the Metro North train into work everyday. I‚Äôve been doing it for this job for about a year. I can‚Äôt afford to live in NYC because it‚Äôs too expensive, but that is where my job is. So I live upstate. I spend about 5 hours per day commuting. (2.5 hours each way). First I have to drive 15 minutes to the train station (gas money), then I have to park ($3.50 per day parking fee), then I take the train ($475 per month). Then I walk a mile to my job from Grand Central to avoid the $130 monthly metrocard for the subway. I leave my house at 6:30 am and am at my desk at 9:00 am. I am exhausted before the day even begins. I don‚Äôt have time to do anything. I get home at 8 pm and just want to lay down. No time for exercise. No time for dating. No energy or motivation to care about basic household chores or shopping. I just want to sleep... and I am broke. I am single and have to do everything myself. This commute takes up so much of my day and a huge part of my paycheck. It‚Äôs not even cheap to live upstate. My rent is $1050 per month for a studio. I‚Äôve been at my job for almost a year now so I was hoping for a good raise.  But I heard from coworkers that all I can expect is 2% which equates to about an extra $15 per week. Wow. That just helps me break even because my health insurance is going up and I‚Äôm sure my rent will increase when my lease ends too. I feel so trapped and don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm seriously considering looking for a new job and quitting. This makes me sad because I actually did like the job itself. But it‚Äôs so hard to feel like it‚Äôs worth the effort when all I do is stress about money and whether or not I can afford the transportation to get to my job. Imagine if the company reimbursed me for the train ticket and also paid me for the time spent traveling. I would want to stay with this company forever. For context, this is a very very successful company (not a small struggling business by any means). So, I just feel angry and helpless. What should I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/drhchz/expensive_and_timeconsuming_commutes_should_be/,1572872731.0,58,0.97,23,antiwork,MandaPanda586

[https://newmedia.calcalist.co.il/magazine-24-10-19/a04.html](https://newmedia.calcalist.co.il/magazine-24-10-19/a04.html)

(The writer is a journalist, and at some point was the editor of TimeOut Tel-Aviv. It might seem like a dream job from our perspective. And then you stumble upon this column).

\*\*\*

**‚ÄúI bought a car to get to work.** I insured it, and I pay for gas to get there.

I purchase and prep food to have at work, and when I shop for clothes - I buy ones that would be comfortable to wear at my workplace. I rather not go as far as saying that I pay rent so I‚Äôd have someplace to rest before work; but unfortunately, it's true. Soon enough, I‚Äôll have children, and I‚Äôll be paying for daycare and various other similar arrangements for them, because I‚Äôll be at work.

In order to escape this vicious cycle known as ‚Äú**adulting**‚Äù, or in less flattering terms: ‚Äú**life**‚Äù, I could take various classes in what little time I have in the evening, after I stood in traffic on my way back from work. I could learn flamenco dancing or martial arts, or go to a movie to consume some culture, and once I‚Äôm done with those enriching activities - I can go to sleep and wake up early, so I won‚Äôt be late for work.

I can also participate in all kinds of mindfulness movements, **‚Äúlive in the moment**‚Äù and ‚Äú**choose to be happy**‚Äù; statements not dissimilar to ones often uttered by **prisoners**: ‚Äú**you can put my body behind bars, but as long as my mind is free, I shall remain free**‚Äù.

Alternatively, I can decide that it‚Äôs fine that I live at work, and do the following: dress up and go to the office as if I‚Äôm headed for a festive event, or get the food I really like for myself to have at work. They call it self-care in America, when they actually mean the **commercialisation of self care**. I can decide it‚Äôs oh-so-much-fun to chat up my coworker in the office‚Äôs kitchen, about what kind of salad she made on Friday; or establish an elaborate opinion on some reality TV episode everyone‚Äôs talking about, to create a genuine and meaningful moment. After all, those are all tried and true methods to maintain one‚Äôs humanity, even during the darkest times in history. Even in murderous sects.

Truth be told, I don‚Äôt even know why I bother going to the gym, or apply anti-wrinkle creams on my face, since the only people who get to see me in full daylight (well, fluorescent light) are strictly forbidden from ever being attracted to me. I‚Äôm not actually required to look good, just ‚Äúpresentable‚Äù.

**Who is to blame for all of this?** Certainly not the cost of living alone. People have been working since the dawn of days, often times more than the 8 hours of full-time employees, or 14 hours of IT slaves, or the bizarre limbo of always-working and never-working of freelancers. Every population in this country is working all day long. Even the loaded ones are at work all day, every day. They just have to drive a more expensive car to get there.

The blame lies in **the illusion of free will.**

If I weren‚Äôt tricked into thinking I get some kind of a choice here, I wouldn‚Äôt have complained. But I was always expected to **‚Äúacquire an education‚Äù** and **‚Äúbuild a career‚Äù**, a satisfying career even, to strive for **‚Äúself-fulfilment‚Äù** and other damned lies. **So many wasted words**. Just tell me to shut up and go to work, I‚Äôll understand. Tell me in advance that life is what happens for 3 hours every evening, and I‚Äôll set my expectations accordingly. I‚Äôll treat that time as sacred, I‚Äôd prepare for it, I‚Äôd *work* for it.

And I‚Äôd be utterly, truly happy.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dp4jsc/i_work_for_my_job_meytal_shapiro_opinion_piece/,1572429188.0,77,0.94,3,antiwork,[deleted]

This email is to inform us of the passing of one of our coworker who died as a result of a heart attack he suffered last weekend.

Later today, we had an all-employee meeting regarding our health insurance for the upcoming year.

do8ric,A Brief Review on This Subs favorite Billionaire,"Welcome all. Today I‚Äôll be discussing the one CEO who gets a pass. The one who is almost God-like and is single handedly saving our lives. The underdog according to some users (in this sub, actually), or the only ceo who doesn‚Äôt care about $$ (yes, still in this fucking sub). Well I thought I‚Äôd throw together some info on this supposed savior. It‚Äôs early and I haven‚Äôt had my coffee or nicotine so I might leave out some of his ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù or my writing might not be perfect. Apologies. 


I spent a decent amount of time in a thread trying to inform other users of this sub (yes, of THIS sub), that Elon musk is no different than any other billionaire. All replies to top comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dmym5s/selfmade/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


Instead of responding one at a time to his boot lickers, I figured I‚Äôd just make a big ole list of reasons why you should stop worshipping him. 

First maybe we could look into why so many people are worshipping him and only him. Like most billionaires, he has a team of workers who monitor his PR. He even came out and talked specifically about reddit and his team working there. 
(Only link-less claim, couldn‚Äôt find it. If anyone has info on it please send it to me. From about two-three years ago).

People in the thread were defending him for Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúbreak throughs‚Äù and how much they help the environment. I‚Äôll touch on this last, but first let‚Äôs talk all things not Tesla. 

Hyperloop: an idea birthed by the thought that ‚Äúyou could be standing by anybody on a subway‚Äù. He has completed a mile of tunnel that was supposed to be offering free rides last December. He now hails it as R&amp;D and not the actual tunnel. He had a plan to sell the dirt as compressed bricks, then someone pointed out the housing crisis in his state, now he‚Äôs going to sell them at 10/c a pop. 

That was May 2018. I‚Äôve seen small demonstrations of the bricks being used. If any musk stans who are lost and still hanging out in this sub have any info about the houses he built please PM. 

More specifics on [the glorious tunnel](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/12/19/elon-musks-tunnel-project-in-los-angeles-is-bad-joke/)


He‚Äôs info on what the bricks [could have been used for](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20874588/musk-boring-company-dirt-bricks-cseb-affordable-housing/)
Hint: they shouldn‚Äôt leave the tunnel. 

Phew. Well musk fans probably downvoted and moved on by now. For those of you still with me let‚Äôs talk maybe they‚Äôre reading the good news of Musks New Solar Roof! Literally just launched v3 yesterday.  And idea that originally launched in 2016. And don‚Äôt worry, these aren‚Äôt the same ones from earlier this year![poor Walmart](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-walmart-roof-tied-to-tesla-solar-panels-lawsuit-2019-8) I kinda hope they are going to be like the ones from 2016 where thousands of people paid for a reservation and dozens received a product! [outstanding](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/tesla-solar-roof-tiles-where-are-they.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
(There‚Äôs a video of a poor sap who paid a huge reservation and is waiting for a third year if anyone has it)

Now some people might come in and say musk is revolutionizing solar panels and making them used by the common man. Users also responded to me and said the same thing about Tesla‚Äôs batteries...
People fail to realize, musk bailed out solar city in 2015 and bought out his cousin, fellow South African billionaire. The tech was their before musk. Same with Tesla using Panasonic batteries. He isn‚Äôt making them accessible for the common man because the common man can‚Äôt buy from him. He isn‚Äôt the only business offering solar and most business are going to look elsewhere after the wal mart lawsuit. 

Does musk get new people to use greener methods? Yes. He is a salesman. Selling things he didn‚Äôt invent. Does almost every other billionaire who owns any stock in any energy company get people to use greener methods? Yes. Why is musk different? Because he‚Äôs a meme and acting like he is your eco friendly buddy is way easier than being realistic. 

Are environmentally conscious people following musks lead? No they‚Äôve had solar panels for a decade.  They drive a 10 year old used car that doesn‚Äôt need raw materials and lithium that Tesla doesn‚Äôt even know how to recycle. 

Now here‚Äôs what really gets me. People tell me all day that Elon doesn‚Äôt care about profits. He only cares about bettering the world. If you are in this sub and you believe this in your heart of hearts, take three steps back and literally fuck your own face. This is [AN ANTI WORK SUB](www.google.com/search?q=musk+labor+laws&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#sbfbu=1&amp;pi=musk%20labor%20laws)

So many fucking results. You could spend a day reading up on this union busting piece of shit. Tell me why he doesn‚Äôt care about money and then explain why someone who has no needs for profits milks every last penny from his workers? This link alone should tell you all you need to know. 

Now on to tesla. I‚Äôll start off by saying what Tesla, not musk, gets credit for. Making an Electric vehicle that a younger crowd and not environmentally aware crowd wants. 
Tesla made the first electric vehicle to most people. While this is far from true, many see it as fact. 
The battery is made by Panasonic, so don‚Äôt be like users in the first thread I linked and praise Elon for his battery break through. The battery is also the best feature of the car. Don‚Äôt get me started with other issues I have with the product. (Worst paint &amp; panel gaps in the business, interior feels like the plastic from a Honda oddessy, ‚Äúself driving‚Äù bullshit that his idiotic customers believe and then pull some shit like reading while driving.etc etc.)

I have him credit where credit is due, yes? If any musk stans actually read all this please tell me what you think. I‚Äôd love to hear you still justify his praise by telling me how he is still different than the others. I am 100% sure some one out there will. I am prepared to answer with other CEOs that maybe we could worship instead because ThEy HeLp MoRe ThAn HuRt. Why is he helping so much? Because space X? Do you miss the days we used to praise the astronauts and engineers and not the billionaire over lords who let them use a small fraction of their money? Or is he helping because rich people are buying Tesla‚Äôs then trading them in three years later for a newer Mercedes they‚Äôll drive for three years. Maybe the new Tesla roadster would help too. Why make the cheapest EV you could for the masses when you could release an Uber expensive one that goes fast?



Honorable mentions: Thai cave incident, SEC fining him over damaging tweets, his Twitter is more comparable to Donald trump than any other celeb, [reddit user spilling his beans on Space X](ttps://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/c7pmaf/yes_spacex_really_did_falsify_test_documents_no_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) , his claim to help flints water crisis, claiming to be socialist while union busting and being the largest donor for a republican PAC, people believing neuralink is coming in a year or so, being a ‚Äúgreen CEO‚Äù to all his lap riders and then selling them flame throwers they used once and forgot about.

You have minimum wageslaves defending their own mistreatment. And everyone always has the same excuses, word for word too which is why I believe brainwashing is involved. 

""Well that's just the way it is!""

""In this other place this other person has it worse!"" 

Always gotta use the ""somebody has it worse"" shtick. Imagine thinking like that for everything. Imagine getting a 40% on your test, feeling bad about it, but then get told that because someone else got 20% you're supposed to be grateful. So now you've been fooled into being grateful and happy ... over failing your test. This is what they do to keep you complacent and sedated. 

I think it should 3 days off MINIMUM. I think that should be law. People should be standing up for this. This is our lives, do we want to waste it doing things we dislike for so much of our time we neglect what's really important? Some people have nothing outside work to the point where they die a few years after retirement due to a lack of purpose in life. Or they go work at Walmart where they stand at the entrance to hand you crap. Imagine being so stripped of your humanity that you don't know what to do with your time when you're not at work.

There are plenty of people out there with the skills necessary for the job who would be happy to take a job where they‚Äôre paid what they‚Äôre worth! This is ESPECIALLY true for jobs that don‚Äôt require complex training, like cashiers, hostesses, etc. Yet THOSE are the jobs that are chronically understaffed, go figure! 

The perfect example is my company right now. Our staff was halved when people just started leaving. I‚Äôve watched my managers interview literally dozens of people for the job over the course of 8 months, and almost all of them were highly qualified. They have hired no one, and keep saying that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúskills gap.‚Äù Yeah, the GAP is between what people are worth and what they‚Äôre willing to pay them, which is too damn low! 

My managers now keep trying to trick me and my one other coworker into working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. They‚Äôve declined virtually any time off request with the excuse that we‚Äôre too understaffed. They phrase it as a great overtime opportunity, but even if that were the case, what about those initial 8 hours a day in which we‚Äôre expected to work twice as hard for the same pay? 

The bottom line: If you‚Äôre working extra hard to make up for having so little staff, then technically you‚Äôre enabling your employer to pay people below market rate, including your own pay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dmlcig/just_a_reminder_when_youve_been_understaffed_for/,1571945270.0,218,0.99,14,antiwork,[deleted]

This morning 50 people were rounded up one by one and shown the door. No notice whatsoever had been given. It was horrible seeing adults choked up and teary eyed.

I thought this company was half decent with it's flexibility, benefits and usual transparency on operations but this was brutal. 

I have been planning on quitting in two weeks to go travel and was contemplating when to give notice but after today, fuck them.

The crazy thing is people feel lucky to still be there and are working harder than ever while taking less time for breaks. This lay off has had the opposite effect on me as I am completely demotivated.

There is no loyalty. It's all a race to the bottom.

dlburx,Can't believe this is it until I die,"A bit of a rant, I guess. 

Can't believe that life is just going to be working an unfulfilling job for people who don't give a shit right up until the day I either die or physically can not work anymore. And in the latter's case, I'll likely just end up homeless anyway.

I work full time and take something like 14 credits at school. It's not even a sustainable schedule - I give up the possibility of a full night's sleep every single night during the week so I can make sure I'm putting in all of my hours at work and getting all of my homework done. It's wild to me that we live in a culture where doing this make you look like a hard and dedicated worker in the eyes of others when the very idea of it should be fucking insane to any normal person. I'm not doing it because I want to do it. I'm not getting an accounting degree because I just \*love\* the thought of dull accounting work for the rest of my life. I'm doing this because I'm trying to grab at the slight chance that, one day, I won't have to worry about one financial crisis being the complete death of me.

It's insane to me that we have to cling on to the hope that, someday, things maybe won't be awful for us. I don't understand how I'm just supposed to be okay with being miserable and working most of my time away for the rest of my life. 

I've been sick recently too and by the grace of my corporate overlords, I've been granted a reasonable health plan that allows me to get myself screened for various ailments. Lo and behold, I may actually have cancer. 26 years old with the possibility of cancer, and I've done nothing but serve a corporate master for most of my adult life. On the plus side, if I actually am that sick and it's at a point where fighting it is useless, I'll just drop everything and spend the rest of my time doing whatever the hell I want with my fiance.

dl5hql,'You'd get bored if you didn't work' (rant),"So it was Monday today, cue the inevitable morning moan in the work kitchen about weekends being too short and spending another week wishing away the majority of my life being a shit situation.

That's when a voice (from the sales team, of course) pipes up 'You'd be bored if you didn't work though'.
And then my reply of 'I'm bored here, mate. Being bored anywhere else would be a bonus. Besides, I've got too much stuff I want to do to get bored.'

Personally I fucking hate this stupid reason for working. I'd be bored not working? Fuck right off. I can't pack all I want to do into a lifetime of not working, let alone when I am working. I'm a sculptor in my spare time, I have loads of sculpts I want to do. I have loads of movies I want to watch. I want to learn to animate better. I want improve my drawing skills. I want to study writing and do some of my own, I want to learn more about physics, I want to travel to different countries and learn about their culture, and I want to learn a new language. Not to mention there are hundreds of games that I've never gotten around to finishing. I play board games and dungeons and dragons with my friends, doing more of that would be amazing. 

If you feel you would be bored without work, then you really need to realise just what you could do with your time on this planet other than making some other fucker richer while making yourself miserable and denying yourself self improvement.

dl2xpk,I love my job. It still makes me sick.,"A lot of people who don't understand the antiwork mentality will often say, ""You just haven't found the right job.""

I have found it. I am a medical laboratory scientist. I help save lives. I run labs that identify heart attack and stroke. I crossmatch blood to save people in traumas. I prepare platelets for cancer patients whose own platelets have been destroyed by chemo.

And I am burned out. Most of us are. While I'm at work, I'm fine. I don't feel the burnout so much. I love going in ever day and making a difference, plus I just think the job is cool as all hell. I get home *energized*. But after the extra shifts drag on, the stress starts piling on. Eventually, I break down. It feels like I wasn't meant to work this much.

So it's not about finding the right job, at least not for me. It's about finding the right work-life balance. It's about wanting more than a weekend, and not having to reschedule half the lab to get a week long vacation once a year.

Why give the students more time and less hours, when you can pump them put a year faster making them work a year longer? I go to school, do my homework, dread the next exam, go home and just wait till my next schoolday starts. Free time isn‚Äôt free time it‚Äôs just downtime from school, even weekends are a downtime.

In the past I wanted to become a lawyer, since I genuinely like the job but all this working and torture for it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it really. At this point I just want a job which minimizes the time I have to spend creating surplus value for a person, whose only accomplishment is, to own the place I am working at. I don‚Äôt want to work hard for my degree, whats the point? It won‚Äôt change the fact that I will be slaving away 50 years of my life for a capitalist, no matter the degree, this will happen. The worst part is that work doesn‚Äôt habe to be this alienating, work is actually fun when you do it for recreation.

I work a retail job and on Sundays there is only two of us working.

We dont have many customers that day so the first two hours of the day its just me in the shop, and its the best 2 hours of the week. Hardly any customers and i can just dust the shop while listening to a podcast.

Then the other staff member comes in, i go to take the rubbish to the compactor, and she questions me on it and says she can do it later. Um excuse me im the shift supervisor and im taking my 3-4 minutes out of the store thankyou.

Then when it comes to customers and sales. Im going to let you into a secret, I dont care how much money the store makes, i dont care.

I'll always greet customers, ask if they need any help then leave them alone. This is enough to make enough sales that I wont get fired, and thats all I care about.

dk5q6o,I was fired for being sick,"This happened yesterday at a UK supermarket (the one with orange and purple styling that may or may not rhyme with aimsburys)
This is kinda an update to a post I made last sunday where my manager threatened to fire me because I was sick. Well, when I got into work yesterday, there were fliers up advertising my shifts as a new opening. After I clocked in, a different manager took me aside and told me that I was being fired and that I could either resign right away, or I could wait to be formally fired by the head manager (the one who threatened to fire me, turns out she decided to fire me then and they just never informed me) when she gets back from her holiday in a week. They cited that this was the third strike in the 11 weeks I had been there, the other two instances I was late by 10 and 12 minutes for reasons out of me control. (They ignored that every single other shift I was between 5 and 15 minutes early)
I am just sick of caring about jobs that dont care about me. I really fucking tried there. I worked faster and better than the people who've been there years, but all I accomplished was making the company slightly richer and I get thrown away like fucking garbage. This was in guildford and I can supply more details to prove that it happened. I joined our union a couple weeks ago, so I'm gonna get a representative and just waste as much of their time with meetings and bullshit as possible.
This would be illegal if I was an employee, but you're not technically an employee until you've worked there 12 weeks. 
The actual incident last week was that I caught the flu and informed them that I wouldn't be able to work, but could still come in if they want.

djcbbi,The people with the ‚Äúdream jobs‚Äù at my company hate their work.,"
Last week I had to help out a different department than I normally do in my company. It‚Äôs a very interesting department which is almost impossible to get into and the employees each have over 20 years of experience and titles in coveted positions. I was basically just shuffling paperwork of course. As someone who is rarely jealous of other people‚Äôs work, though, I have to admit I was feeling a bit envious of the city views from the manager‚Äôs office window. 


However, any time another employee would come and greet me and they felt like we were alone, every single one of them told me how much they hate their job, how they‚Äôve been understaffed for years, how they had no idea ‚Äúwhat the fuck their manager did all day,‚Äù and how they wish they had saved more for retirement when they were younger so they could leave. One woman went on and on about how everyone in the office was an alcoholic because there was no other way to deal. When another guy came and talked to me, he said the exact same thing and told me that he‚Äôd been commuting for almost 4 hours a day for *over ten years*!!! Another employee told me that she‚Äôd just picked up a second job to help pay for a higher degree.

I was dumbstruck. To be honest, whenever things aren‚Äôt going well at work I usually see if there‚Äôs anything I can change first. I figure that if no one else seems upset, then maybe my expectations are too high, I‚Äôm being too lazy, or I‚Äôm suffering from some kind of lifestyle inflation. My experience last week changed that. It really made me feel like I could work as hard as possible and still be miserable. The title, workload, and office might change- but the mentality of selling way too much of my time to an employer for too little in turn would stay the same.

dj111o,My funemployment plan isn't working out very well,"After years of being pressured to excel in school and to get a good job, I feel that I have lost the ability to enjoy life and to even understand what makes me happy.

In my first few days of unemployment, I got so stressed out because the new hire, my boss and my ex-colleagues kept messaging me with questions even though I am no longer getting paid. This is what happens when my bosses gave me too much work in my final week and still expected me to handle the entire handover process. There is only so much a person can do.

I am thankful that I managed to escape from that toxic environment. Now I am overwhelmed by the free time on my hands. ""What do I do with it?""

At first, I envisioned a ""funemployment"" period in which I could finally restart some hobbies like reading, exercising and cooking. I overestimated my passion for life and it turns out that I am now apathetic to everything. Even small chores take away too much energy.

People be like ""Oh, keep applying for jobs!"" and ""Upgrade your skills during this time!"". Our lives revolve around building ourselves into better workers to be enslaved to employers. Every responsibility is being shoved onto the individual. If you fail, it's your own fault. Too bad you did not get a good enough degree in the right field, too bad you don't have the relevant skills and too bad you couldn't handle the work stress.

Sorry for this pointless rant. Yesterday night was tough because I was struggling with sudden suicidal thoughts. I feel sad about the fact that I am programmed to study and work. I am not a human anymore because I don't even know how to enjoy some extra free time. Unemployment is starting to get boring.

digy8g,"Whenever I talk about what I do, someone here always replies, ""are you guys hiring?"" Trust me, you do NOT want a do-nothing office job. Here's why","I keep seeing these comments of users wishing they had a B.S. job. I get that many of you engage in difficult physical labor, and sitting at a desk all day might seem like something to aspire to.

Well, I'm here to say the grass is definitely not greener here.

Here are the reasons:

1. **Skill deprecation.** If you do nothing, you don't gain any meaningful experience that would allow you to get another job in the future. In many fields, the knowledge you already have becomes irrelevant over time as industries evolve. It's a vicious cycle, where you can't get a better job because your current job is bad.
2. **Non-physical jobs are back-breaking too, literally.** Humans are not meant to sit for 8-9 hours a day. For me, the results have been very painful. After suffering from debilitating chronic back pain bouts over the past few years, seeing specialists, chiropractors and physio, I came across a research on this. Apparently job dissatisfaction is one of the most [common predictors of back pain](https://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0701/p220.html).
3. **Other health implications.** Being immobile for 40h+ a week is bad for you. If you find the energy to go to the gym after work every day, kudos. I don't. It's surprising how draining it is to do nothing all day, even though there's very little physical exercise involved.
4. **You can't re-purpose the time for anything more useful.** Offices these days do not have cubicles. The trend is open space. Everyone can see your monitor.  You're also monitored electronically - your employers likely have some system to track browsing history. There's also a slow and inconsistent stream of meaningless work, small tasks (emails, spreadsheets, online forms) that requires context-switching and break your concentration.
5. **Everyone around you is fake**. Fake smiles, fake corporate jargon, fake agreement with everything management says. Ranting does not happen. I think this self-censorship is internalized, those who partake in it might not even be fully aware. [Offices are dictatorships](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/17/15973478/bosses-dictators-workplace-rights-free-markets-unions), where free thinking is forbidden and supposedly-voluntary obedience and acceptance of the dictated values is the key to success. On my last 2 jobs, your coworkers had to write quarterly reviews on your performance, so you couldn't even be open with them.
6. **You can't treat it as just-a-job - it's your DREAM!** You're forced to be fake too. You have to act like this is your passion, not just something you do to get paid - even when you're so bored you want to fall asleep at your keyboard. You won't be hired unless you say this is your true calling and act accordingly (they call it ""a good cultural fit""). The cognitive dissonance is frustrating.
7. **Boredom is worse than you think**. David Graeber's book, [Bullshit Jobs](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs/), discusses this elaborately. It's proven that extended periods in solitary confinements, the extreme example - an ultimate state of boredom, causes *brain damage* to prisoners. There's a famous research about how humans - even babies - enjoy play because they like when things they do have some visible consequences in the world, even if small. Humans need to feel like they're doing something useful to themselves, or to someone else, to build their self esteem.
8. **It's your life you're wasting away.** There's something inherently frustrating about spending hours composing some report, because that's how your team does things, only for it to be filed away and knowing NOBODY read/used it. Same as any job, you're wasting what little time you have in this world on doing nothing. The fact you're wasting it at a desk doesn't change the fact life is short, and you're throwing it away.
9. **(Added) Fear they'd find out you're useless and fire you.** I always worry that they'd figure out my role is not needed and let me go. Though a part of me craves it, so I'd be forced to find something more useful to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/digy8g/whenever_i_talk_about_what_i_do_someone_here/,1571184405.0,148,0.98,41,antiwork,[deleted]

dic1rz,The madness of it all,"You probably know it. You go to work to work a job you likely don't enjoy or are neutral towards. Doing things that you probably don't care much about at a pace humans are not really meant to work at for so long to pay for (rent, mortgage, whatever) a house/flat you're never in because you're at work paying for the house/flat. Then you get home too tired to do anything (or do it long or well). When you do do something you try and cram as much in to those few hours. Then when the weekend to come and you shove all your life in two days except you can't because you've got to prepare to do it all again. And no one sees the problem or even thinks to create something better. It's all in the hope that one day, after 50 years when your body is spent and has no energy and that you have enough money to do what you want to do in retirement. Surprise! Your body is way past its prime now (for most anyway), in part due to illnesses and afflictions caused by the modern working environment, so good luck with that A 5 on, 2 off system for 50 years is far from perfectly balanced.

My mind goes down this sort of line of thought sometimes when I get a moment to relax and think at work

dhrqsk,Anyone else grow more Misanthropic by the Day?,"I'm on vacation right now from work because I'm going out of town this week. Anyway I haven't thought of killing myself at all the last couple days and have generally been in a good mood. But, this world has been setup in a way that I don't think I can tolerate it the rest of my life. I don't know how any rational human being can be mentally/physically capable of spending 8 hours a day doing repetitive crap for 8 hours a day then going home and watching TV until they fall asleep.  People say you have to work to contribute to society but, what society? I couldn't tell you my own fucking neighbors name. Humanity had the chance to build a society that people would enjoy living in shortly after they discovered agriculture and the industrial revolution. But, instead of using our brains to our advantage (which got us this far by the way) we decided that since there is plenty of food and no danger we'll just fuck like rabbits. And the rich took advantage of the fact and bought up all the land and resources  to rent or sell back to the rest of us at the expense of our time and sanity.  Lots of these jobs are manufactured as well because heaven forbid everybody doesn't have a job. And they keep inventing new and better shit for us to buy to keep the wheel moving. But, here's the thing. What if I'm completely happy with everything I have and just want to sit in a reasonably priced housing and enjoy it?  Why do you need to sell 30 years of your life to get something everybody needs to live like a house? Why are parents so quick to get rid of their children when they are 18? Don't you want a better life for your kids? Just going to sell them into slavery rather than let them stay at a house that's already been paid for? If I ever have kids I would want them to have a better life than me. That means not wasting it doing stupid bullshit they don't care about just to support a life I forced on them. So they are free to stay indefinitely and they can inherit the house when I die. But, all that aside life feels like you've been shipwrecked in shark infested waters and you're supposed to find your way back to land.  Like really? I'm supposed to be happy when my whole life is orbiting the shit sun?  Sounds like something Jim Lahey would say. Anyway yeah.

dhms54,My job is fine. It's wage labour as such I hate.,"I hate work. It is not because I don't like the tasks I get at work. Many of them are interesting and challenging. I also like my colleagues. They are nice and friendly people. My bosses are also nice, down to earth and has never given me any trouble for asking for time off for family matters. I work in a nice office only a few minutes bike ride from my home. I'm not burdened with huge work loads or tight deadlines. The pay? Well it's there and although it's not the kind of money that will allow me to pay off my student debt or retire before I'm dead at least it keeps abject poverty at bay. I should be reasonably happy about my job. It is as good as I can reasonably hope for and many people have it significantly worse. But I still hate going to work.

I don't hate my job as such. It is the concept of forced wage labour I hate. It is knowing that I have to do it day out and day in. It is knowing that no matter how nice the bosses are the logic of capitalism will compel them to fire me if I'm no longer productive, hurling me into poverty and unemployment. It is knowing that ultimately I'm not seen as a human being with inherent dignity but as a cog in a machine that will be replaced if I'm not performing as wanted. It is knowing that I have to wake up each morning before I'm fully rested and go to work each and every day no matter how I feel about it.

It is knowing that I can only complain about it in obscure corners of the internet like this. Everywhere else a host of right wing troglodytes will emerge and shout abuse at me if I complain about work. It is knowing that the only viable alternative to wage labour is starting my own business which is even fucking worse than wage labour.

I know that we need to produce goods and services for society to function and I don't have a fancy detailed plan for what should replace wage labour and capitalism. I just know that I hate it and that I want it to stop.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dhms54/my_job_is_fine_its_wage_labour_as_such_i_hate/,1571035403.0,165,0.98,32,antiwork,Regicollis

Moved home, spent nearly a year constantly suffering and self hating, hurting myself, drinking, alone, hopeless. I am still struggling a lot but I got a dog and a job and things are improving. 

My dog of course helped a lot. The job helped a ton as well. I make minimum wage working retail full time, I do sales in a niche hobby I love. So i get to talk to people all day about my passion. I have much more purpose and excitement to learn more, social skills improving, it makes me happy to help others and have conversation. My coworkers and managers are excellent and caring.

dfpfyy,Spending 6-8 hours a day doing any one thing day after day is insane.,"I think people realize spending too much time on one thing thing is unreasonable. ""You spent 5 hours playing video games? Get a life."" ""You spend 4 hours a day reading? I can barely read for an hour."" ""You spent 3 hours at the gym? Wow you're a gym rat dude."" ""You spent 12 hours on that drawing? Thats a long time!""
 


These things are all hobbies, and yet we're shamed for spending too much time on them, and not enough time at work. I spend 6 hours a day with a boss who i hate and a fraction of that time with my boyfriend who im often too tired to interact with in a very meaningful way after work. 



On a slightly different note, even passions can grow tedious after too long. I like drawing and video gamrs, but if you asked me to sit down and draw or play the same game for 6 hours it would get difficult. Even if its a very good project or game, after a couple of days i would need a break. Yet, we are expected to work thousands of hours for years doing the same things over and over again. Its no wonder that people hate their work so much. Even jobs that i would be passionate about for a month would start filling me with resentment.

dfnjsl,The big 40 hours workweek lie,"People are generally bad at measuring and managing time. That's why selling them this 8 hours sleep, 8 hours work, 8 hours free time nonsense was so easy.

Let me just quickly go through my yesterday.

7 AM. alarm. My sleep is interrupted 3-4 times per night due to noisy neighbours, paper thin walls and workers who get up at like 5 AM or even earlier. I can't afford better housing unlike CEO's with their mansions.

9.30 AM. I arrived at my office. 30 minutes late due to traffic.

1 PM. Went for lunch with my colleagues. Everyone just ordered a quick meal and skipped drink while stressing how much work is ahead of them. I ordered a drink and took my time with my meal. My stomach is already pretty bad and I don't want to make it worse by quickly munching on some cheap food and racing back to the office.

3 PM. Came back from lunch. I was told our project manager was looking for me and I should report to him immediately. Got assigned a few ""priority"" tickets. Seems like every ticket is urgent these days.

7.30 PM. Time to go home. Our office is still packed despite all other places long shut down.

[8.PM](https://8.PM). Finally made it out after quickly resolving a problem with my commit.

9 PM. Arrived at home. My head hurts so bad due to severe sleep deprivation. I immediately put on noise cancelling headphones to block out the thumping noises from my upstair neighbours.

11 PM. I finished bathing, a little bit of apartment cleaning (I have a cat so there is always some mess waiting for me. But I love him and will never give him away.)

Midnight. My hobby is art and there is an ongoing challenge called inktober. I am supposed to draw a piece per day following the official prompt list. I can barely hold a pen and my eyes are so heavy... I inserted earplugs so I can be woken up only 3-4 times during night instead of 10 and skipping meal, went to bed.

df2bnz,I‚Äôm more miserable in a comfy office job than I was in the military.,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm anti-work per se, more anti - meaningless corporate zombie work. 

Short backstory for those who care:

I served 5 years in the military as an infantryman, which was infinitely more demanding than my current 8 hour a day, 5 day a week office job. However, I never felt this anxious, hopeless, and depressed while serving, even though I would spend full weeks/months sleeping outside in shit weather and working an average of 12 hours on a good day back in ‚Äúthe rear.‚Äù 

All politics of the Miltary industrial complex and imperialism aside, I felt I had a genuine purpose and knew my place in the world, and I had an intimate understanding of myself. I had a crystal clear understanding of what my tasks were for the day and what my role was in accomplishing a given mission. I also had a very strong community of people I actually considered a close family or brotherhood, as corny as that may sound, they weren‚Äôt just ‚Äúco-workers.‚Äù And the shared hardships only served to strengthen that bond. 

Not to mention, if I wasn‚Äôt deployed I‚Äôd get 3-4 days off for a holiday (as opposed to just the single day) and 15-30 days paid vacations after deployments (post-deployment leave) 

Now, I sit behind a computer all day pretending to be busy, and have to pretend to care about the timely completion of a project to make some faceless rich person even richer while I can only hope for a slight raise after years of my life are dedicated to this. 

The motivation used to be life and death and winning wars, and I find it hard to muster up the willpower to behave with the same sense of urgency over useless corporate buzzwords and excel spreadsheets. I‚Äôm just desperately counting vacation and sick days until I can take my next short stint of artificial freedom from this endless cycle. 

I genuinely feel more imprisoned and consumed by my work than when I was in the fucking military for Christ sakes. This cannot be how humans were meant to live. This all feels so meaningless and I can barely find a reason to get out of bed every morning. I essentially get paid to act like I give a shit and it‚Äôs more mentally demanding than I ever would‚Äôve imagined.

She said that she isn‚Äôt going to make me change my plans (as if that would even be an option, I would quit on the spot if she did), she then said oh but you will be here on Monday and Tuesday and I said yes but as previously mentioned I will need to leave early on the Tuesday to get my flight, she said I had never told her before and that my attitude is bad and that this isn‚Äôt how you do things etc etc

detx48,An antiwork success story.,"A few years ago, I was like many of you. I hated my job, the thought of going in and doing the same thing over and over again for 12 mind-numbing hours a day, 5-6 days a week, gave me nightmares. It had me sitting outside work breaking down. My mental health was bad, I had no semblance of a social life and every week I thought about ending it all. I hated the fact that I couldn't see any way out of this hole that I had gotten myself in to for the next 40-50 years. One particularly bad day I made a decision, there and then. I simply thought to myself;  ""Fuck this, enough is enough"" and went in and quit my job on the spot. It was the best decision I've ever made. Admittedly, for a couple of days I was beside myself with worry. I was thinking to myself; ""What the hell am I going to do? How am I going to survive."" That's when I decided to be proactive and reorganise my life to the way I wanted it to be. I went back to college (Thankfully, something that's free in my country). There I took a course on music production. A subject I was always interested in. But, while I was at college I also decided to get rid of all the ties that had been keeping me down in my life. I gave up my expensive flat and moved into shared accommodation, I paid off all my bills and got rid of any direct debits and credit cards. I paid off my overdraft and then cancelled it. I went back to basics. I removed myself as much as possible from the pursuit of material possessions as I could. I don't care about owning the latest gadget or newest clothes. I reduced my life down to the necessities; Food and shelter. I went from paying out ¬£1500 every month to paying ¬£200. A couple of months into my course, and with my savings starting to take a hit, I thought I'd better go and find a part-time job to keep me ticking over. I got a job working the door of a local bar. It was 4 hours a night, 3 nights a week, 9pm - 1am. This easily paid for my reduced living expenses and still left me with an enormous amount of free time and money to study, play music or just generally have a social life again. I started loving my life and the 12 hours a week I was working were great. Eventually I got interested in DJing and it just so happened that the local DJ in the bar I was working in was planning to leave soon. I asked the boss if I could take over for him as I had all the equipment, and he said yes and that he was actually going to ask me the same thing himself. So, here I am, 7 years later, still doing what I love every week. I work on the door every Saturday night, DJ every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. I work no more than 16 hours per week and get paid a ton of money. I'm loving my life and am infinitely better off financially and mentally. The moral of the story, i guess, is put yourself into uncertain situations and always try and learn new things. The best thing I ever did was walking in to work that day and say ""enough is enough"" while quitting on the spot. It lit a fire under my arse and made me reevaluate my life and what I want to do with it. No job should have you sitting in the carpark crying at the though of having to spend a minute more in its employment.

Individualism - Anti-collectivism = Wage slavery (Doing things the individual way is always going to cost more than living and sharing costs as a group.)

Self-worth defined by your career and your ties to the market = wage slavery

But I don't have any other chores that I have to do for kids which are so mindless, time consuming and monotonous. School runs, packing lunches, arranging birthday parties, managing tantrums , cleaning shit are just some few of the tasks I would be putting up with had I been a parent and I cannot fathom how I would maintain my sanity at the end of the day to begin work the next day.

How do parents manage to even turn up to work and do something is beyond me. That's why maybe they are all shitty at their tasks to begin with as their minds are constantly all over the place thinking about what needs done at home or for school for kids. Especially the ones with toddlers, these guys can't get enough sleep at night and still manage to come to work the next day, maybe half sleepy.

I cannot do that, maybe I am not a human being or I am depressed or its my basic inability to cope with life whatever you call that, I cannot be a parent and work at the same time.

ddctg2,Corporate Language is Cringey AF,"I love when companies use the term ""passion for customer service"" in applications/training videos/workplace rewards. It truly shows how they're:

A) Super alienated from the material conditions of the working class, and/or
B) Using Orwellian psychology to attempt to brainwash their workers.

Let me make this clear: no one working an entry level job has a ""passion for customer service"". In fact, I'd assert that hardly anyone has a ""passion for customer service"". No one works at a grocery store because they love to be bitched at by boomers, and then proceed to make said angry self deserving boomer happy with free shit; we put up with it because we have to to pay the bills and literally not starve to death.

""Yeah I love being bitched at by boomers for something that isn't my fault. I feel accomplished when I'm able to make that expired coupon work"" said no one ever. 

So yeah, I can't help but get aggravated when I hear that retarded ""passion for customer service"" shit. The people that APPEAR to have a ""passion for customer service"" are people who are just really good at faking it and have a lot of patience.

I'd have a lot more respect for a company if they dropped the double speak and were honest. ""Hey guys, we know we don't pay you shit, and we know you hate this job, but let's just make these grumpy boomers happy so we can make some money and not collectively starve, okay?

dcands,Working as a mail carrier literally made me cry and made me feel I aged 20 years.,"Several years back I took a job as a city carrier assistant with the United States Postal Service and was so excited. Several months later my body and mind was a wreck. 

- 6 day work weeks 
- 7 day work week during holidays (No lie, USPS has contract with Amazon and can ship on sundays)
- Carry a load of a work mule
- Old tin can work vehicles that would always break down. One time parking brakes didn't work and vehicle literally rolled down street as I chased it down after dropping off package
- Management asking workers to clock out and continue working
- Dogs let me tell you about dogs. I had ptsd regarding dogs for at least a year afterwards. Several times I had to pepper spray loose violent ones.
- The heat, rain, freezing cold, pollution, etc.. didn't matter. You went out and worked
- Mailing into the night literally with head lamp and going through people's yards to drop off mail
- JUNK MAIL! Over 50% of the work load could be eliminated just be having a policy of no junk. One day a week we would get ad day where we had to load up 6 or 7 big parcels of local ads. Each mailbox was to get one.
- Rashes between thighs, feet burning, paper cuts, rubber bands snapping, shoulder &amp; back pain, you name it
- No reward for hard work. If you finished route early they would just go send you to help another
- Drunk citizens yelling at you, people filming you as they laugh watching a dog chasing you, harassing about if you got their paycheck, etc..

I literally thought the heat would do me in as I live in the south. However, it was actually the cold one day. It was pouring down rain in just about freezing temperature. I had a mental breakdown and started crying. I wiped my tears and finished day. Next day I was on first stop on route and turned around. I went into office laid keys down on manager's table and I was done. I think that was the most relief i had ever had in my life.

dc9ab9,Burnout is a huge problem.,"I don‚Äôt do bad in stressful environments, but the weekends are too short to really detox.

Sunday is spent preparing for your week.

And Saturday is spent doing chores. So I have little downtime.

I want to take a few days off but I‚Äôm a contractor.

You‚Äôre partnered in this environment. And I don‚Äôt want to let her down.

Edit: We really need to mandate either less hours a week or knock off a day for a three day weekend. 

Of course this is just a start, we really need to get awareness raised about this for the greater good.

I recently dropped out of college after a few talks with my dad, and he told me it would be better if I came home, and that college wasn't doing any good for me. I'm incredibly grateful that my dad is so kind, but on the day I came back, he told me about a job prospect he heard about. I just brushed it off at the time, but internally I felt terrified and almost shut down. I've had 3 jobs before, all of which were in fast food, so obviously they were awful, but that's given me a lasting impression and has made me absolutely terrified of any sort of job. I tell him that I feel this way, and he just doesn't get it. He tells me that he found having a job at my age was liberating, that it gave him purpose. I tell him I feel the opposite way, and he tries to argue with me, trying to convince me I somehow don't know what I'm feeling. I think he's doing his best, but it's like there's a barrier that prevents him from considering that I have a different opinion. I feel trapped and scared because I have to get a job in order to achieve my dreams, but I don't want to.

d92yqo,Nobody should have to come to work sick.,"I'm sick. Like real sick. There's been a flu going around the farm for a week or so and it finally got me. I'm not upset with my coworkers, they need money, too. I'm angry that only a few higher ups have PTO. I'm also angry that the farm owner is also landlord to most of us. I work ten hour days just to give a significant portion of my paycheck back to this guy every month. 

I'm also upset, scratch that, I'm pissed off at the level of guilt tripping that happens any time someone can't be at work. It's an established fact that I go above and beyond to pick up other folk's slack. My bosses joke about it all the time. That sucks. Watching people who make more money than me slack off and bask in the bounty of my labor is bad for me in every way. I haven't been sleeping or eating well for months, and I weigh significantly less than I usually do. My body isn't healthy and this illness is kicking my ass. In spite of all of this, one of the guys who does have PTO made me feel like absolute shit for leaving this morning. He knows how hard I work. He knows my body isn't healthy because of the job. Still, he had to make me feel like shit after our boss told me to go home. I'm still working from home (spreadsheets for seeding, cultivation, and harvest). I'm working from home while sick, already not getting paid for two days this week, and on top of it all I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack because I don't want my team to think that I'm ""lazy"" or ""wimpy"".

It sanctions interpersonal and psychological attacks and lavish praise to destabilize an individual‚Äôs sense of self and promote compliance. It uses the coercive pressure of organized peer groups. It applies interpersonal pressure, including attacks on individuality and criticism as a form of negativity, to ensure conformity. It manipulates and controls the totality of the person‚Äôs social environment to stabilize modified behaviour""

d62wyf,"This has been the best time of my life, and I don't want it to end.","All my life, I have always had so much to do and so many places to be. I was an extreme overachiever in high school and graduated as valedictorian, but I still used to fake sick two or three times a month because I felt like I just couldn't take another day. I graduated from a top college with a 3.8 GPA. I got a scholarship and financial aid and faced zero debt. But I still broke down crying from anxiety at least once a week. Every paper I had to write and every test I had to study for was torture. I just kept thinking that if I just pushed past that hump, it would end, but it never seemed to end. Even summer vacation was ruined because not doing anything with my summers would ""look bad"" on my resume or grad school application.

I panicked in my final semester because I was sure it would be impossible for me to get a job. Nevertheless, I managed to snag a cushy, well-paying office job right out of school. We had a fully stocked office fridge. They brought in Panera on Monday mornings. We had pizza parties and theme weeks and played video games during lunch. I was almost never required to stay past normal hours. The office was a five minute commute that didn't even require me to take the freeway. It was supposed to be over. That was supposed to be the goal. But it never ends. Instead, I went in five days a week for two years, staring at a screen, pouring my prime hours of my prime years into shit I could not care less about. I would sit in front of my computer for hours procrastinating, constantly looking over my shoulder, hoping nobody would notice I wasn't working, wracked with guilt. I made all my deadlines, but I constantly felt like a fraud because so much more of my effort went into just getting through the day. I took up smoking just to get out of the building. I went into the lounge and cried into the throw pillows. The hours between leaving the office and bedtime, everything I did was eclipsed by the knowledge that I had to do it all over again the next day.

So I played it smart. I lived with my parents, put away almost all of my income, and amassed a nest egg that most of my friends could only dream of. I was a millennial with a net worth. That was supposed to be it. The goal. The end. But every day felt like walking through honey. Or tar. Even though I was making money, I was also wasting money. I was spending a lot on food because I was too tired to cook, and I felt like I would go crazy if I didn't get out of the office at lunch. I was spending on a gym membership because I was too tired to go hiking regularly. I was spending money on vacations because I needed escape, and my whole hometown felt like a prison. It never ends.

After three years, I knew I couldn't do it any more. I had saved money, and there was no point if I didn't use it to escape. So I moved to a rural area and took my ""dream job"" at a non-profit, taking care of rescue animals. It was low-paying, but the area was much more affordable, and I was doing what I wanted to do. Despite the low pay, I lived frugally enough to save a modest amount without even touching my prior savings. For a while, it was great. Then the bureaucrats struck. With budget cutting, short-staffing, and a widening range of duties, we were being asked to do more every day without any increase in pay. We were treated by management with a disrespect that bordered on disdain. The animals suffered. We suffered. I was reminded that, even when you are at your ""dream job"" and times are good, you are always at the mercy of the bureaucrats, and it will be bad if they decide to make it bad. Eventually, a little over two years after I started, I threw in the towel. That was two months ago.

I decided to take a real break. Although I have been making small moves toward becoming a freelancer, I have only been putting in minimal effort and largely been taking it easy. I'm doing a few odd jobs - tutoring kids, shoveling compost, nothing that will earn a living - but mostly I have been spending time with my pets, reading in my hammock, gardening, playing the guitar, doing art, going hiking, cooking, baking, housework, minor repairs (that I have been meaning to do for ages), and doing all manner of other things that require little money or even leaving my neighborhood. I eat fresh baked bread every morning with herbs I grew myself. I finally cleared out my garage so I can use it as an art space. I don't feel the need to run off to Japan or Germany or any of the other places I used to vacation because I needed to be as far away as possible from my job for a few weeks. I am probably the happiest I have ever been in my life, at least since I was a little kid.

But the future keeps pressing on me. I have enough savings that I could pull this life off for a while - a year at least, probably a good amount more if I really keep my expenses low. My rent here is super reasonable, and even if I am in the middle of nowhere, I don't feel the need to escape as much as I used to. What used to be the prison I retired to to cry in between stretches of wage slavery is now my little modest corner of heaven. But I keep worrying about how long it can go on. I'm haunted by the thought of eventually running out of money and having to go back to the rat race. I've been looking into WWOOFing, homesteading, joining a commune of some kind. I am not afraid of hard work, and I would be willing to work much harder even than I have in the past if I were not so alienated from my labor and the beneficiaries of it. After years of living like Sisyphus, always trying to pretend the boulder won't come rolling back down on me, I finally know what I want out of life. I am finally learning that there is nothing wrong with it and nothing to be ashamed of. Now, I just have to pursue it. I can't let up, I can't chicken out, I can't ever go back. There is no way I can go back now that I know what I'm missing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d62wyf/this_has_been_the_best_time_of_my_life_and_i_dont/,1568835255.0,92,0.98,12,antiwork,BlitheCynic

Studies also show that heart attacks and suicides occur more frequently on Mondays.

Work being a shitty suckfest is kind of the 800 lb gorilla in the room; No one openly talks about it because it's taboo - most everyone has to pretend that they care about their jobs, because they can be fired and replaced at any minute, and be unable to feed or shelter themselves.

While education is important and useful, the rigid school system also seems designed to indoctrinate generations of obedient worker bees to make them fall in line.

Baby circus elephants are tortured and tethered when they are young, so that they give up on the idea of escaping. After they are grown and could actually overpower restraints, they don't even try. This concept is called ""learned helplessness"".

d259jv,Co-worker made fun of for taking off work for having food poisoning,"This happened last week. I work security and been at this job site for a little over a month (2 months at job). Each shift has 2 guards, 1 on gatehouse, 1 roving. Some have multiple properties they work at but at this property 7/10 are boomers. Most are stereotypical ""pull yourself up by your boot straps"".

My 20-year-old co-worker who joined the property about a week after I did isn't too liked by the boomers. He doesn't put up with corporate shit, I respect him. He does the bare minimum work for the pay. He's a pretty nice guy to me. Anyway, last week he comes in and looks like shit, says he has food poisoning from bad fish or something he ate earlier and said he was puking. Came in anyway, apparently he didn't do amazing work that night. This is an 86 acre property in about 90 degree heat, where I typically walk 13.5 miles a day. I can't imagine doing my work sick.

He calls in sick the next morning and all the boomer fucks that were there at the start of my shift were like ""He wasn't even sick"", ""I come in when I'm sick"", ""He didn't check this door properly last night"", etc. Ridiculous shit. Then just a few days ago, one of the boomers (who sits in the gatehouse all day) comes in with the flu and makes a remark ""If I can come in and do my job sick, Joshua can too"". First off, you're stupid to come in for an 8 hour shift when you're sick. Is your life and well-being that meaningless? Secondly, you're sitting in the gatehouse all day vs. constant walking in 90 degree heat.

They also took Joshua off this weeks schedule, didn't update his schedule in the app, didn't call to let him know and he came in to work his shift from a 45 minute commute, only to see someone else was working that shift.

d21ko7,The Prussian School System conditions children to accept corporate slavery,"Our schooling system has not evolved in over 100 years. We still use the Prussian school system which is designed to instill obedience so that children will not learn how to think for themselves.

From the book ""Future Shock"",

""Mass education was the ingenious machine constructed by industrialism to produce the kind of adults it needed. The problem was inordinately complex. How to pre-adapt children for a new world ‚Äì a world of repetitive indoor toil, smoke, noise, machines, crowded living conditions, collective discipline, a world in which time was to be regulated not by the cycle of sun and moon, but by the factory whistle and the clock.""


This isn't different from today. Schooling instills obedience in us so that we are prepared to obey our superiors in the workplace and never think for ourselves. We went from taking orders from teachers to taking orders from managers. Lunch breaks are still lunch breaks. Exams turned into performance reviews. Bullys are still bullys. What's changed?

We were young so we didn't realize the damage that was done until it was too late. Most likely your parents didn't care because they were too busy bragging about your schooling accomplishments to their peers.

d211xa,Something happened today to a fellow employee.,"Today, one of my fellow employees was berated by a manager in front of the entire staff. Keep in mind we are ALL new, this store has yet to officially open. I believe the guy simply asked the manager where a mop was after a spill. The manager, who was busy yelling at other people for not having FREE pizzas ready on time (remember, we are all still in training) He procedes to tell this guy if he doesn't like it, then ""clock out and go home"" ""How bout we start using our brains people?"" 


I couldn't help but feel bad for the guy. His face was red with embarrasment. I've always hated work. All work, but I've never seen someone in power behave this way. I could only think, if that was me, the only way I could react after something like that would be violently.



I've quit jobs in the past because of my anxiety and the overwhelming urge to simply tear the throat out of any person that I felt was treating me badly. Whether it be customer, coworker or management.

d1q0fx,We‚Äôre literally being scammed out of living.,"*Rant*

Imagine having to go to school (a full time job) and do what a bunch of people tell you while simultaneously hushing you. Then go to college (a full time job, that you pay for and if you miss too many days you get dropped.) To MAYBE get a job that MAY pay you a living wage let alone a fair one with the ability pay off your debt from the aforementioned college.

About 90% of the people that are telling you what to do and how to do it are incompetent and stuck in traditionalist ways because it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier that way.‚Äù

We‚Äôre being indoctrinated, literally being turned into GDP and for what? A chance to make someone else successful and hope they treat us like we‚Äôre at least human; just to die in the end anyway with slightly more than you started with? (Which won‚Äôt matter because oh‚Äî You‚Äôre dead.)

Imagine that‚Äî Oh wait this is reality.

Everyday I feel like living is a mistake.

But the concept of working 40 hrs a week for somebody else's dream makes me tired everyday. I hate when I shower every morning and commute so I can go and make money for others with my knowledge. I literally hate Monday mornings. 

I realized that we've been trained like monkeys from childhood itself to work for rest of the life.

If there's no concept like Job, I'll do the same work but for good purpose and with love. I'll take rest in-between my work like an hour, a day or even months before resuming the work. There'll be no weekends. The very concept of weekends need to die. Everyday should be relaxing and rewarding to us. 

It's all the fucking capitalism that makes us hate everything about this world.

d1it2s,I can‚Äôt believe my self worth and value was tied to corporate jobs,"Unbeknownst to me I was living with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. All my life. I turned 25 in August.

When I started working full time things went downhill from there as I couldn‚Äôt function like everyone else and do what I needed to do as a diligent employee. Cue me being fired from every job I‚Äôve ever worked in, in the private sector which led me to a deep dark depression that has led to self harm and frequent suicidal ideation. I had dreams of teaching the top of my career and being ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô. I had failed at doing that. 

There were months where I couldn‚Äôt even leave my bed I felt like such a complete and utter failure. My mental health was in the drain and I had to go on benefits and was signed off work due to mental health. 

Because of the way this world is set up, my ADHD wasn‚Äôt picked up as I went through school, through work through life, and adulthood. I just wasn‚Äôt good enough, not working the way I should and producing results. 

Companies have their bottom lines and nobody is ever thinking or trained to think...woah this girl might actually have a problem? This world is so fucking ableist and us with hidden disabilities have no chance. Because our ‚Äòimpairements‚Äô aren‚Äôt seen we have ‚Äòno excuse‚Äô and just lazy and dysfunctional.

Anyway it‚Äôs been a whole year since I last worked in an office and I feel a lot happier and reassured. I used to feel so awful and ashamed that I was home most days whilst everyone went to work but I‚Äôm at home healing, resting, going at my own pace and trying to build up my confidence and self esteem. This sub has done a lot to change my perspective, if you guys read my first few posts I was going through it. Thank you all so much for the support honestly. 

I‚Äôve started helping my mum out with her tailoring business and it‚Äôs going well! I‚Äôve taken over her social media and getting her more customers and have even launched a sewing school for her to teach. It‚Äôs really fun, and it‚Äôs ours. Nobody will fire me and take that away for me. I‚Äôm in control.

I‚Äôm also going back to study something I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about and work in the public sector instead helping young people.

I currently run my own small business from my local library, helping people with resumes, cvs, job applications and giving people free advice on things.

I no longer see corporate success as the be and end all and I‚Äôm a lot more spiritual now and less materialistic.

I think I‚Äôm going to be okay :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/d1it2s/i_cant_believe_my_self_worth_and_value_was_tied/,1567985838.0,121,0.99,19,antiwork,SelenaPacker

Now I'm finally about to finish the damn thing and now i have to have a MANDATORY phone number and name of a previous supervisor? Does this shit sound absolutely insane to anyone else?

czc6qa,I'm so fucking jealous of the people who get to decide to just fuck off and do what I'm desperate to do,"I know we all kind of resent people who a) could be retired or have enough wealth to live on and still waste their time withering away behind a desk or b) don't have the money to do that but bootlick like they think they do. I feel that's pretty reasonable, to feel angry or at least annoyed by. However, I carry the burden of resentment for another group of people who definitely don't deserve it, and there's a number of them in this sub.

I am so, so jealous of people who are able to scrape by on minimum work or low-paying work they really love. I'm so jealous of people who decide ""fuck it"" and move to another country or another city with no plans. I am so, so fucking jealous.

My boyfriend is chronically ill and relies on my health insurance. We have 5 pets that I could never consider giving up. Animals are probably my greatest passion in life, and I wish I could be working with them every day instead of doing data engineering to figure out what kind of products our players (we make games) buy the most while all those surveys of them telling us what they want are ignored. I know exactly what I would do if we had a windfall large enough: buy a ranch in Montana, join a farm collective/land trust, and rescue animals from abuse and factory farms. I would give fucking anything to do that. Hell there's a ton of things I would be happy doing, I'll be a horse groomer, a brick layer, I'd live in a fucking RV, I don't care. But I'm not even able to work from home without easing into it over the course of a year or so. 

I make great money. I support a 2 person, 5 pet household as the sole income earner at 24 years old in a very high cost of living city. We have a good life, my workplace is... As ideal as it could be, and yet at least once a month I break down in tears and make my boyfriend promise on his life that I won't have to do this forever.

So to the people who risked it all, who have the freedom to say you're heading out into the world and see what happens... I hate you, and I'm proud of you. Live your best life for both of us. Because as much as I hate working in this soul sucking job (that even has interesting work to do, good people, great benefits, good pay, etc really the perfect job on paper for the most part) I would hate to see my boyfriend sick or give away our pets more. 

And to the people who have the ability but choose to wither away at a desk or grind to the bone when they could be living their life on their terms, is it your ""work ethic"" that will hold your hand as you pass away? Will your ""passion for the grind"" hold you when you find out you have cancer? No. If you're going to throw away such a fantastic opportunity, at least let me pick it up. 

The hellish part is I know someone, a friend's boyfriend, whose family is legitimately rich. Like, be private island/private jet rich. You know what he does? Works retail part time, plays video games all day, and doesn't even fucking pick up after himself while his girlfriend works full time. You piece of shit, you could change my whole entire life, the lives of so many people, what the fuck is wrong with you? How do you sleep at night? 

We leave for a vacation tomorrow, 2 weeks at a national park, 4 days completely off the grid. I'm of course so excited, but I'm so scared. I'm afraid I won't be able to come back. I'm afraid we'll return, I'll sit down at my desk and realize I can't do this anymore. All this stress, all that school, all the crying and anxiety that I wouldn't get a good job... Only to realize this won't make me happy anyway. I put my expiration date at about 5 years before I completely lose my shit. 5 more years and I have to stop. Maybe we'll get some universal healthcare (dare to dream) so we don't need to worry about my boyfriend's illness, but I'm not counting on it. 

I hate feeling like a coward when I sit down to work each day. I hate feeling like I'm wasting my time and being an idiot. It's not my fault the man I love was born with a defect. It's not his fault. But we're both punished all the same, and I'm shackled to this desk. I fucking hate it. I'm so angry all the time. I cry a lot. I lash out. My days slip by so fast, and I'm so, so tired all the time. I hate Sprint planning. I hate being the only woman in a room full of men. I hate work being the only place I can make friends. I hate happy hour, I hate bars, I hate being inside, I hate sitting. My body is decaying from the inside out. I used to be an athlete, what the fuck happened? I hate this. I hate it so much.

Sorry. I really need to vent and I don't really have anywhere to turn other than my boyfriend who has heard it all. I could go on and on.

cyfvm6,"A Positive, Uplifting Story About My Antiwork Hero Housemate","I thought I'd share a positive, uplifting story about a guy I used to live with.

The guy works in an Amazon Warehouse. He was a quiet Romanian lad who played computer games and liked smoking weed. Nice guy who enjoyed making music.

One day, he comes back home, knocks on my door, and enters my room to see me playing on my PS4. So he asks me what games I want to play next. I told him that I am looking to buy the new Assassin's Creed.

He comes back the next day with a copy of Assassin's Creed, and gives it to me. I ask him where he got it from and he tells me not to worry. I then offer him money and he refuses it. I don't ask anymore questions and put the game on.


He knocks on my door again a few days later, and asks me if he can test a game on my PS4. I say fine, and he continues to test random games on my PS4 for about a week.


I've realised that he is obviously stealing games from work, and ask him wtf is going on.¬†


He says he is stealing, because 'if they won't give me a payrise I'll just give myself one.'

 He then shows me the ten PS4 games in his backpack that he had stolen from work that day. He was selling them on.

One even said that she needs 2h daily to get to work &amp; back and that this time should be paid too.

It was interesting to see how different ages react. Usually the older folk I talked to here were like ""That's just how it's always been. We can't change it!"" or ""You gotta find hobbies to do after work!"". 

This discussion kinda motivated me tbh. If unions back in the years fought for 8h instead of 12h work days and won, then I'm sure that we have a chance too.

cwg6al,Jeanne Calment was the longest living human in history: 122 years old. Her secret? She never worked a real job in her life.,"The person in history to have lived the longest (verifiable) was Jeanne Calment. She died at the age of 122, and since then no other human has made it to this age.

But there is something else about Jeanne Calment that makes her unusual but nobody talks about.

She never worked a real job in her life. She was born into money, then married into money, remained a housewife, and after her husband died, lived off of his pension and free rent for the rest of her life.

cu6e4e,Got a written warning for reading a paperback book during downtime.,"Today I got a written warning for reading on my downtime, not taking a lunch break when my boss wanted (everyone pretty much takes it before leaving and goes home early), and for taking 1 OT hour.  


I have this job. I started this job a year ago. It's a help desk position for a giant company (the largest for their type of company in the world, actually). I have so many complaints with this place, all the way back to the start... I'm a contractor because big companies contract work out to save money. My contractor company bait and switched me, telling me in the first interview a higher rate of pay than what they eventually offered at the time of signing papers. Not enough to make me run for the hills... But definitely below what I should be paid. I took the job because I am desperate, live in a rural area, and for the low cost of just traveling an hour to and back a day, I can make enough money to barely afford a life.  


I busted my ass (60+ hour weeks) on rotating shifts (You switch every week from 6 AM - 4 PM to 8 PM - 6 AM to 10 AM to 8 PM and back to first shift). It was brutal but I did what needed to be done to get to a stable place in my life. The shifts were hard, but they allowed you to get a natural 50 hours, 10 hours OT, every week, just by showing up for work.  

I went beyond the shifts often because people were late, or I volunteered for extra work on the weekend. My manager knew I was using OT but he saw I did a good job and let me be. I learned like a sponge and soaked up everything they threw at me. Soon I knew everything about 200+ applications, networking, enterprise-level computer imaging, active directory, company procedures, data workflows... I am helping take hundreds of calls a week for a two man team,  making hundreds of tickets a day... I get so much experience at an enterprise level. It's got to count in the long run, right?

After three months of being a great worker, I was promoted to the supervisor position of help desk. Still a contractor. NO raise was given to me by my contractor. They conveniently ignored when I got the promotion. I was too tired and busy to fight for a raise because I was excited my efforts were going to get me even more promotions very soon. My contractor craftily told me that the only  way to get raises in this company was to get promotions. So I bided my time.

My schedule becomes set, no more rotation. I start coming in at 4 AM (waking up at 3 AM) and leaving at 2-3 PM (so 9-10 hours a day). I do this to get my reporting for management done during my first two hours there, when it's quiet and not hectic, and so I can be available for third shift to tell me what happened while they were manning things alone. People think it's crazy, but my boss knows this provides IT coverage when no one else is in the IT area to provide it. He lets me do it and I'm honestly okay with it, because I am no longer on rotation. I am getting enough sleep and no longer having micro-naps while I'm driving.  


As supervisor, I know everything and I basically carry the help desk with my knowledge of processes. I suggested changes to the way the help desk worked and everyone on my team enjoys me and our work now. I try to do the best job I can so I get noticed by the departments down the hall that pay TWICE what I make now... If I can make that kind of money, and learn what they do, and get that experience, I'll be set for life. I just know. I fucking know it. It fuels everything I do. That dream of making it. My contractor tells me after I interview for a position like that that I definitely am first in line to get it. Months pass... The promotions never came. I figured out the big company was more interested in hiring overqualified outsiders to be safe, or getting H1B visas in for sweet government kickbacks.  


However, financially, I was finally getting things in order, settling some debts, feeling secure... Then the big company changed my management.   


New management comes in and is cleaning house as of this month. They are writing people up for things, reducing costs, etc. They notice people taking OT and tell everyone to stop it in a general email. So I look at working 8 hour shifts, instead of the 12 I usually did. I immediately know this is going to kill me. I calculate my new paychecks. My landlord raised rent and now a single check will not cover my rent. I feel like the skeleton of economic endgames is tap dancing on my career grave because I. am. financially. fucked.

I take the 8 hours and swallow it. I start to weight options. I cut off expenditures. I go to my contractor and ask them, please, god, a raise? They tell me that because I received a (mandatory) cost of living raise (not COL, it's only half a percent) already this year (everyone received it) that I am no longer eligible for raises this year. That skeleton takes his top hat off and starts rattling his cane in my face.  


Because I am a supervisor, I am taken into many meetings at various tables about all the stuff that's going to change for help desk. More responsibilities, more things we are going to take over on to make the new management look good, good, GOOD! 

Oh, by the way, they tell me again: no more OT, especially not mine. They also say that it would be best if I came in at 6 AM and left at 3 PM, and I MUST take a lunch during the day, because you know, at the manager's old job, back in the 1980's or some such, someone sued the company for not being given lunches... So we must take ours! 

Ouch. I am trying with  8 hours, but I have my reasons for leaving for work as early as I do... Because I live in a rural place, there's only one road out of the mountains. Around 5 AM, tons of people get on this road to get to the city. They drive like madmen to get there, brights on, riding your ass the whole way on a twisty road with blind curves and semis crossing the lines... It's stressful and scary and I prefer to leave at 3:30 when it's empty. Sometimes I can even get to work in under an hour this way... ""I prefer 6 AM"" is all my new manager says, and that's that.

By the way, I ask, while we're here... Can you talk to someone on your end about the raise? I heard the BIG company can influence the contractor on getting people raises. ""Why, no I can't do anything about that. Don't you know I have it hard, too? I'm only making 90k, but I should be making 100k because I'm a manager and not a specialist anymore!""  


Oh yeah... I totally understand that. What a hard time you're having!!   


The skeleton's head falls off onto the table we're sitting at, but my manager doesn't seem to notice.

So I wake up the next week and come in at 5:30, I leave at 1:00 to stay under 8 hours... The next day my manager assigns a meeting at 2:30 PM. I ask if we can take it earlier. He ignores me. So I have to stay over to meet with him. I read a Stephen King book about a child murderer during the downtime at help desk to take my mind off everything that's going on. 

I have the meeting: I am going to train the new hire that's coming in, and by the way, ""we need you to write up a whole training regiment for her by Friday..."" The skeleton is in the parking lot on my way to my car, holding up a time card that says 9.03 hours of time for that day, like a demented Olympic judge... And I feel like I just took a dive from way up above the concrete.  


Today I get a call on my cell phone this morning... My manager has called me from the meeting room right behind me, telling me to come in. Why here's my manager, seated with a woman... Ah, it's my contractor company rep. I've talked to her many times, told her about what's going on at the help desk, been a good friend... Now I've finally met her face to face.

My manager says ""\_\_\_\_\_, you disobeyed me. I told you no more OT and you have 1 hour of OT on Tuesday. You came in at not 6 exactly and left at not even 3! I am going to have to have you sign this written warning.""   


My rep agrees. ""Yes, we told you when you signed up you must ask a manager for OT."" They didn't. But I'm tired. I'm really tired and I see no hope in this situation. I don't even argue. I just write on the paper for comments: You do realize I am paid LESS than the people I supervise now, right? I don't get the natural OT they do. How do you think you'll ever get another (FOOL) to do this job if it means a huge rise in responsibility, no raise, and less pay overall?  


I read this message out loud as I write it. They stare at me, goggle-eyed. They have no response because this was a pageant, not a meeting of rational minds. They said their canned HR warning and did their grim dance, right there in the meeting room as my co-workers watched me in greedy, lurid fascination, already gossiping about \_\_\_\_\_ getting chewed out, YUK YUK! 

My manager does finally say something. ""Well, would you like to go back on rotation?""

I set my head down on the desk and look at the floor. The skeleton is underneath the desk, staring at me. It gives me a thumbs up.

My manager then says ""Also, don't ever read a book at the help desk again. You are setting a bad example for the other help desk workers if you aren't seen working when you are the lead. This is an official warning.""

While I work to learn and grow and do a good job in the workforce, that skeleton of disappointment, of absurdity, of banal pointless labor for no real reason... It's there in the corner while I work, staring at me, doing those really obscene push ups where you clap with both hands on each push, maybe even winking, just waiting to throw me the stupidest fucking dance routine it can come up with.  


I'm tired. I think they're crafting a case to dismiss me. It's really weird. Two months ago, the old management loved me, and they let me do what I needed to do to tread water. It changed really, really fast.

I'm going far, getting nowhere. One of my friends who heard my story of today said don't be sad, keep going, I have so much to offer. I said I feel that while it might be true, I also feel like I'm running out of places to find and put my effort. They all seem rotten... Am I crazy if I keep doing what hasn't worked before?

ctalx8,"Work doesn't just ruin our lives, but it destroys our relationships and society as a whole","I'm probably one of the lucky ones. My job isn't stressful and requires only about 20 hours per week of my time. I work from home every Friday and generally all my afternoons are free. This should be the life, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to not be stuck in some of the horrible jobs Ive had in the past, but here's the problem. Society is so structured around everyone working 40 hours a week that even if you don't, your stuck in that same lonely trap. Because everyone was so busy and stressed by full time work, my friendships deteriorated years ago. Over the years the good friends I had became more sad, angry and irritable. When we got together they seemed to be to anxious to leave. We weren't having fun anymore. Once a week get togethers became once a month, then maybe 3 or 4 times per year. My husband's job seems to be taking a toll on him as well. He comes home very stressed, is in a bad mood (unless he has a few drinks) and I feel we are drifting apart more too. I've thought of looking for other things to be involved in, see if there are social activities im the neighborhood or something like that but there's nothing. I leave work and walk out on to totally empty streets. Everyone is stuck in their offices for a few more hours still. I live in a suburban townhouse development and the homes are really just places for people to sleep between work shifts. Ive lived here 14 years and I know no one. I never see anyone. There is no sense of community.
Even if you can get yourself out of the 40 hour per week trap, you're affected by the damage it does. The disconnection takes its toll. When you're disengaged from people its harder to have empathy for others. Society just gets colder and lonlier and worse. It's every man for themselves. 
The real work that needs to be done to improve our cities and towns isn't being done, because everyone is busy working to make a few people richer instead of improving ourselves. We waste our lives, toiling away to support businesses that at are at best unneeded and at worst doing active harm to people. 
I read a few books on this (Bowling Alone, Lost Connections and Bullshit Jobs) and the conclusion seems to be the same. Work, in the current state its in, is ruining us. We no longer have time for friendships, or to raise our own children, or do the things that we personally value or would find rewarding. Things need to change. We need to cooperate to make this change, but work keeps doing it's best to pull us apart. It leaves us too tired, too lonely, too depressed to do anything other than lay down on the couch and flip on the TV. I wish I knew how to help fix this, but I don't know where to begin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ctalx8/work_doesnt_just_ruin_our_lives_but_it_destroys/,1566355286.0,85,0.95,13,antiwork,nothingtolose878
ct91zv,"Friends, please don't work hard.","I have a coworker who gets upset at how little some employees seem to be doing. He works hard, so he understandably takes offense when a manager spends all day in the office on the computer. Or when he sees someone at the register with their hands in their pockets(this is retail). He told me he has brought it up with the general manager a few times and hasn't gotten the result he was looking for. 10 years ago, I probably would have felt the same way he does about the situation. What I finally learned though is that the coworker who doesn't hustle isn't lazy, they're smart. 

The idea that working hard is going to get you promotions and raises is 5% reality, 95% propaganda. If you're really good at your position, and you outshine the other employees, management sees promoting you as a loss. If you work the shifts no one wants and are compliant with unreasonable requests, they have no good reason to promote you away from that. It was hard for me to learn this, and it took a long time, because I'm from the midwest where a ""strong work ethic"" is practically religious doctrine.

At my workplace, people kind of have an unofficial mantra that goes ""As long as you deliver, you'll be fine"". I think that people see this as reassuring in a way, but if you look at the root of the idea, it's really not. It's basically saying that you *must* perform and try to muster up the energy to donate your life at every possible moment, or else you will lose your means to survive or keep your current standard of living. It is basically saying that you are never *actually* secure. 

I see this obvious everyday anxiety as deliberate cruelty. The people on top know that they are making people feel this way, but they happily allow it to persist because it keeps them in power and everyone else's heads down trying to survive.

And do you know what? It felt great! Being out in the fresh air, getting a bit of excercise, cleaning up the park, making this tiny spot on earth a tiny bit better. 

I figured if I did this a couple of hours every day, I could clean up the whole park system in this part of town, in maybe two, three months - for the benefit of myself, dogs, children and old boomers alike!

Off course in three months I would be financially ruined as well. The system would rather that I go back to selling pointless stuff that people dont really need, than me actually doing something that benefits my local community directly.

cpcxwx,"If You Want to Live Your Dreams, Your Career Will Go Down The Drain","Gaps.

&amp;#x200B;

Gaps in employment history.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived in my van for a year. It was amazing. Waking up to the forest. Reading all day. Not worrying about a goddamn thing. Something we all could use a lot more of.

&amp;#x200B;

The inevitable happened. Van broke down. Savings ran out. Had to start looking for a job. I applied LITERALLY everywhere. First question I would be asked, ""So how do you explain this gap in your employment history?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Why would you employ someone who has spent their entire life working with no clear view of what they want to do? From mind numbing job to mind numbing job, never really enough time or energy to think of anything more to life. My girlfriends dad who had a mental breakdown during his divorce has said ""You go to college, so you can get a good job, so you can pay the bills."" This is not an exception. This is how our society thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

We've seriously only got one life. I for one, want to do some cool shit with it. Who's with me?



EDIT: 



I didn't really mean for this to be about the gap itself, more of just how the system is not built with humanity in mind. We treat people like robots and any sign of them acting abnormally we outcast them. Drug use = addict, 30 yo working minimum wage = stupid, less than their peers, lazy. The list goes on of implicit biases our society indoctrinates us with. 


I encourage everyone reading this to explore their biases and try to figure out how little our conscious minds are able to comprehend. This is the exact reason why so many people are afraid to think of even the possibility of work being optional one day. Fear, as well as many other emotions play a significant part of it. 


People who don't realize this will forever be a victim of a recurring cycle of fear. A fear so great that it makes even the false security of modern society seem like a stable pillar to hold on to.

cpb6ov,I'm so anxious about work this week.,"So long story short, last week I found out that the entire office except me knew that someone I work with had a problem with how I was doing things. Apparently certain people had complained about me and everyone knew but me (edit/I said entire office but probably more like 10-15 people). I found this out when the person with a problem started going to someone else who does my job even though I'm assigned to that person. So rather than address the issue with me, they complained about me to everyone and expected it to get back to me or me to get fired or something? 

I'm anxious because this is not the first time that's happened in the office. It's just the first time it's happened to me. Last time something similar happened the girl got fired a few months later because they determined that her performance hadn't improved even though she hadn't been told it needed to! 

I literally had a stellar performance review 2 weeks ago when all this passive aggressive bullshit was going on and no managers talked to me about it even though they knew. I talked it out when I found out this person had a problem as well as let my supervisor know that I would be making the changes they wanted.

But I'm still extremely anxious. I hate my job to begin with (honestly, I'll admit I've gotten a little bit careless) and now I'm having to deal with this passive aggressive BS. I want to quit but I know if I get just another office job I'll be miserable. I was trying to pay off my car then get a part time job but it turns out our rent will be doubling in February so I can't afford to (unless we boomerang back to my parents' house or something).

But yeah long story short work fucking sucks and even 50 year old men who make $200k a year are passive aggressive children.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cpb6ov/im_so_anxious_about_work_this_week/,1565609880.0,50,0.94,11,antiwork,[deleted]

cpaafu,When the weekend was just too good,"I'm having a bit of a rough Monday.

I can't focus very well, I'm feeling extra apathetic, don't feel like talking to anyone, and generally just feel emotionally down.

Why? I think it's because I had a very good weekend. It was the perfect combination of rest and adventure, and I'm left with wanting more.

I feel the same way after very good vacations/trips.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to the next logical point of ""well, maybe I should not have amazing weekends and vacations, because then coming back to work will be easier.""

Which leads to what the fuck kind of life is this where I can't have *too* much of an enjoyable time away from work, because going back to work is a huge emotional drain afterwards.

Our CEO asked us to celebrate all we‚Äôve done for clients this last year and a half and to try not to worry about the cuts in compensation.

I'd rather have kids than a career, but the capitalists have created an economy where we can't afford to have kids.","Any other millennials getting sick of the endless headlines about how we are ""choosing"" careers over family? Because I am. I am not willingly ""choosing"" a career over having kids, I'm stuck living in a society where it is increasingly *unaffordable* to have children and where there is minimal support for families because society has been set up so the rich can benefit while the rest of us suffer.

I don't find my career fulfilling. I'd be *way* more fulfilled having and raising a family, maybe working part time in something low stress, but my fiancee and I don't see a way we will ever be able to afford that, not when we'd need a bigger place, more money in an economy where wages are stagnant, and when grandparents are forced to work until their 70s instead of helping with kids. Both of us spent a lot of time with grandmas growing up because the economy didn't demand couples work until they were 70+ to retire. 

I'm also sick of being seen as a ""bad feminist"" because I'd rather have a family than a career. I'm not judging anyone who finds fulfillments from their career. But I hate the way we have been conditioned to think we *have* to want a career. Wanting a fancy career is  just not for me.

I was shamed for everything my entire life, at school and at home. I was shamed for being a poor child, for not doing well in school, not doing my homework, not doing my chores on time, for being a woman, for not being enough of a woman, for not working hard enough and it goes on and on and on. 

At some point I stopped trying! What is the point of trying if no matter what you always feel disgusted with yourself at the end of the day?

o2u33k,Fuck the American work force for making ME feel guilty for leaving your shitty job.,"Update at the bottom. 


I‚Äôm mostly a lurker, just here to rant. 

I landed a fantastic job earlier this week, something I will actually enjoy somewhat, that gives me more time to spend with my family, and pays me almost double what I make at my current job. 

I went to tell my supervisor that my last day is on the 29th of June. I did this because I start my new job on July 6th, and seeing as how I haven‚Äôt had two consecutive days off since 2016, I thought ‚Äúyou know what? I deserve a few days. Just a couple days to make a trip to see my parents, and get my house in order. When I told my supervisor when my last day was he decided to berate me, call me immature and unprofessional and then he said ‚Äúwhen your new job doesn‚Äôt work don‚Äôt come back here‚Äù. 

So safe to say I am livid right now. Seriously? After years of working this shit job, and doing every bullshit task they gave me and never complaining this is how I‚Äôm treated?


I just packed up my office, wrote a ‚Äúresignation effective immediately‚Äù and a notice of separation and I‚Äôm leaving this place as soon as the general manager comes back. 

The worst part? I for some reason feel GUILTY AS FUCK for quitting. Like somehow I feel like the bad guy here. I‚Äôve been verbally harassed and manipulated by this job for years to the point where I feel like I owe them something more than a fucking letter. 

I cannot stand the toxicity of the work places in the United States. I don‚Äôt owe them shit. But yet I‚Äôm made to feel like I‚Äôm ruining my own fucking life because I decided to make a change for the better. Fuck that shit. Fuck being ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù and ‚Äúburning bridges‚Äù if a workplace ever makes you feel guilty for leaving, fucking do it anyway. Those bastards are lucky they‚Äôre even getting a resignation letter. 

TLDR: fuck your job and fuck every job. You don‚Äôt owe them shit. If you‚Äôre thinking of quitting, do it. And NEVER feel like you‚Äôre the bad guy, do not put that feeling on yourself like I do. You deserve better, and so do I. The only way the work place culture changes is by us refusing to participate in their game with their arbitrary rules.

**UPDATE**

Wow. Truly amazed and appreciative of all the kind words everyone, I really mean that. Wild rollercoaster of emotions today but in the end I told the manager I‚Äôm done and walking out of there was the best feeling ever. 

The HR manager sent me an email asking me to fill out a Notice Of Separation form, the dumbasses had a question on there ‚Äúplease fully explain the reasons you are leaving the company‚Äù so I FULLY explained that shit alright. [here‚Äôs ](https://imgur.com/a/sILdVVA)  what I sent to HR. I had to redact some names to protect the few good people that were there. Good riddance to that place.

coxpu7,My boss just yelled at me and I can't stand being so weak,"A little context: I am a journalist working at an online site wheres I basically upload news (I work from home) and today has been one very rough day. This weekend is my shift and that shift is 13 hours the day (26 hours lost from the weekend). There is supposed to be at least a half hour break on the noon so I can grab something to eat and not die on my computer and I did just that. The problem is today there has been a massive traffic on news (and all of them are on me to deal with) and I really needed that break.

I guess the boss didn't like that at all. He called me and literally made me feel like dirt... I have been struggling a lot at this job (I also have depression and anxiety so a real hard struggle) and that today broke me. He basically demanded that I had to stay put until all of the news where covered... but they were never ending like wtf. I didn't say anything back at him only ok sir, it won't happen again. Call me weak and sensitive  if you want but after he hang up I started crying.

I can't stop thinking how I am just a 22 year old girl that already wasted herself on psychopaths like my boss. I know I am young and all but was that treatment necessary? I wanted so bad to yell at him and make him feel half as bad as he made me feel but I didn't.

Bosses think they are the only ones that deserve  respect and people like me (slaves) are just there for their needs and are nothing more than horse shit.

The work system is so bad  today for young people... literally they think bc you are young they have some hold on you and can do whatever the hell they want.

I've been in my current job for about 6 months. It's my first high paying salary job but it's just the latest in a line of brutally soul-crushing desk jobs. Long story short, this is the final straw. Its the most stressful job I've ever had and it has basically ruined my life. I'm more physically unhealthy than I've ever been and have recently had two panic attacks where I basically blacked out. This has never happened to me before this job. I'm more depressed than I've ever been and can't really play any music, which is my favorite thing to do.

Anyways, I'm putting in my two week notice today before I leave. My friend has has offered me a part-time job doing construction/remodeling with him. It'll be my first non-desk job since college and I'm SO excited to change up the pace of my life and hopefully get my mental and physical health back on track. I plan to do this job through the fall while also taking time to work out, eat healthy, and write more music. Then my plan is to start with a computer programming boot camp to transition into the next phase of my life, which will hopefully involve 100% remote developer contracts that I do out of my band's van as a touring musician at least a few months per year.

I've always been fired due to poor performance, absences and lateness. I've recently discovered I have ADHD which explains a lot. I can't stick at something long enough and I'm just in general a shitty employee.

I do run a diversity initiative helping minorities into the film and TV industry and an employability service. I love helping and advising people and have managed to run a successful service for over 5 years which is great. I'm good at getting other people jobs they love but can't stay in one myself!

The irony isn't lost on me haha

I've not been in full time work for a year now. And its always made me feel shit and abnormal. I've cried myself to sleep like why can't I be like everyone else? Why can't I wake up, go to work have a stable income and progression in my career? But its honestly so hard. Longest I've been able to do it was like 9 months before I'm let go.

cms9b0,Working Full-time is miserable.,"Hey fellas, just looking for an ear so I can vent, or even advice if anyone has it. Basically, I just passed my two year mark for being a full-time employee (I understand that's not much compared to others' situations but I'm still very unhappy). I've been trying to look for any way to make life easier, but it seems like I've exhausted all avenues. I've looked for part-time work but I won't be able to make rent if I do that, I've tried talking to my boss about working part-time in my current position but of course, we need ""coverage"". For reference, I work in a back-end office position where I get *maybe* 5 calls a week. And there are others in the department as well. 

I'm at my rope's end here, I've even been toying with thoughts of exploiting the welfare system to start working part-time, but I'm really not sure if I'd even want to do that. Maybe all of this is super trivial and I'm just so far down the rabbit hole that I can't think straight. I'm just so tired of not being able to enjoy my life. I get home, I try to go back to my hobbies but nothing sounds good. I feel like I'm optimizing my time to max out my enjoyment of free time before I have to wrap it up and send myself off to work the next day.

I'm thinking of seeing my doctor to get a referral to a therapist, but deep down I know that the actual cause of all this is my work. I'm just feeling lost. I think writing all of this out helped me feel like I actually did something about this.

cll5s6,Fuck my manager who wants me to attend meetings during non office hours,"Rant alert  but I need to get this off my chest.

I work for an Indian IT outsourcing company and apparently the guys at the other end (USA) had tried to contact me during their Friday daytime (my Friday night time) to get some queries resolved.

They tried to call me to my office desk number and sent emails. I had no way of knowing any of this since I dont check my mails during non office hours.

Apparently they have also tried calling my team lead to his mobile number and he too was unreachable due to some reason.

My lead also received an angry mail from the guys who work for the company at USA from which we get the outsourced work with heck lot of guys in CC from both companies. Saying how negligent we are and not responding back to them in a timely manner.

He called me sometime back to tell me about it.

Apparently not checking mail and not picking the calls at midnight on a weekend is a big deal breaker. We're both on hook and have to attend a series of meetings on Monday to deal with this.

To all the asshole managers outsourcing their work :
Yes we're a bunch of low paid outsourced workers from a third world country. But we're just as much as real human being as you are. We have families and a life. We work for you, but you don't own us. Fuck you for treating us like a scum.

clgfbg,There's undoubtedly a limit to a person's happiness and potential under capitalism,"I think this is the worst part of ""growing up"" and realizing the systemic pressures over us.

There's just no escape, I will always be subject to wage slavery, anxiety, social pressure, stress. No matter how much I relax, how many hobbies I try, how much I meditate, leave my hedonist and teen addictions behind, I will still be here, suffering, not being able to find any motivation in a system that kills my energy, my appetite, my will to go on, social relationships, etc. This is why individualistic solutions are problematic: they don't cut it, they aren't made for the majority, but for a little minority that can live off the labour of others, with loads of free time and money to spend (many hobbies are just off limits for the many).

Also, the mindset needed to ""change our lives"" is too difficult to find in a constant cycle of forced work and capitalist relaxation. It just dies off, succumbs to the unbearable patterns of modernity. And, worse of all, the ""gates to happiness"" like free time, creativity or relationships are scarce and filled with worries and commodity fetishism, commodification of human beings makes social existence harsh. It's not about being anymore, it's appearance, it's selling yourself as a commodity that others have to appreciate, in our delusion of narcissist depression.

How can people like ex-alcoholics move on amazes me. Stoicism does too, cynicism, drone-like waking up at 6:00AM everyday on 6 hours of sleep. How can people handle this and progress, and just not go crazy over the state of things? Is alienation so powerful? I find myself being alienated as hell too... video-games, Internet surfing, movies, sometimes porn... that's my ""free time"" well spent, and I'm still going on, but it's as hard as ever.

Then, let's look at the limits to education, even if you are in a country with affordable or free education, you still have to have gone to a good high school or be ""intelligent"" to pass the entry exams or courses, and then time is looming over you, because as soon as you begin working it all becomes hard as hell, grades dropping, attention span decreasing... Like with everything, education as a way to get a better life is also classist.

Not only alienation, but, how can anyone see this and think it is ok or a matter of personal choice? Are people shit? Most of the people I know would say that you failing exams or getting a bad job is your fault, like with your psychological problems, ""you are just too worried!"", ""stop complaining and enjoy!"", ""just talk to somebody"", etc. like it were so easy to change my state of mind and my life already. People think their environment and personal history have nothing to do with them, that they're just as free as everyone else and can change on a whim.

i haven't been this miserable for years. i even relapsed after 2 years of being clean. i know i should just tell my dad, but last time i told him about the job making me feel this way, he just berated me. running away for a bit just seems like a better option right now. i'd go to a mental facility if i had insurance, but since i don't, this is what i perceive to be my best option. i'm gonna disappoint everyone, but i can't take this shit anymore. i've only been there for a month and i'm already this much of a mess. i'm just so lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cj4adn/idk_what_to_title_this_as_its_just_a_vent_i_guess/,1564362791.0,55,0.92,7,antiwork,sabiiitsuki

cipgjc,I've decided I'd like to start a YouTube channel with antiwork themes.,"There seems to be a blossoming of new creators on YouTube offering insight on these types of subjects. I've already written up plans for videos on the effect of modern culture and social media on my life and a video about a major political issue in the UK. For a third video I'd like to cover work culture, the problems the current culture causes and alternatives to it. I wondered if you guys have any insight to offer on how this subject should be approached?

The thought of having to do the same thing, in the same place, with the same people for 40hrs a week for the next 40 years sounds suicidally dreadful (to an extent literally). I can barely function after about 4 hrs due to terrible social anxiety and OCD in most work environments. It's one of the reasons I want to focus on something creative I can do of my own bat without needless drama.

Anyway I hope you guys can provide some advice for a video structure and what sort of things that want covering. I'm coming at this from a very general direction at this stage.

To clarify, this account is not going to be an PR account for the channel. I'm just fishing for ideas casually right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cipgjc/ive_decided_id_like_to_start_a_youtube_channel/,1564275123.0,64,0.97,18,antiwork,jacobspartan1992

ci882q,I've come to understand something about American capitalism by using social media.,"When an American goes to work, he's working next to people who are there to survive, not to live independently in their own place, or save for something, or give their child a good future, but to just survive, and make sure their hand to mouth existence continues. 

I never used to understand this. In the rest of the G7, we joke around, we have our good days and bad days, but fundamentally, if you're fed up you can quit, go on welfare, and move into mom's basement or a friend's couch, all without having to worry about your healthcare or making student loan payments that your government gave you instead of just subsidizing your tuition directly with tax money. 

I've come to understand how and why so many American redditors hate work. It's not a game down there, it's real. They're playing for keeps in a game of 19th century capitalism, and the penalty for losing the game isn't a temporarily empty bank account, but destitution, loss of healthcare, and eventually, imprisonment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ci882q/ive_come_to_understand_something_about_american/,1564173780.0,86,0.94,21,antiwork,[deleted]

chvm85,Is 6 weeks of paid vacation truly an outrageous request for a salaried employee in the U.S.?,"Healthcare aside, I wanted to talk about vacation culture in the U.S.. In the U.S. there isn't a set of laws governing mandatory (paid) vacation unlike in several European countries. Vacation packages vary per country in Europe; 4 weeks seems to be the average amount granted per person (note: this excludes paid sick time which varies) regardless of type of job/career.

Some context: I work in a small office (12 people total) and am salary  exempt employee. This means I don't get overtime at all (even though I frequently work 45 hours per week). I work very hard and am profitable for the company. My boss occasionally scoffs when I leave right on time (even though I show up early).

I know in the U.S. I should be fortunate and grateful to have 2 weeks of paid vacation (including 1 week off during Christmas/End of the Year), but I can't help but feel shafted as a human from getting a real break from Corporate America... I even feel guilty when I speak to others about wanting more paid time off like its some kind of insane request (I know I probably shouldn't have spoken about antiwork in public or even with family, or SO - lesson learned). I was planning to ask for a raise soon but ask for an increase in paid vacation time instead of a salary raise. To me, a 2% raise is almost equivalent to another week off (1 week /52 weeks =0.019) Is 6 weeks of paid vacation an outrageous request for a salaried employee? I can't believe I only get 2 weeks out 52 weeks a year off.

ch8fm7,Vacations Don‚Äôt Fix the Problem,"At my last job I met many people who worked the entire year for a 1-2 week vacation. They explained that it made it worth it and when they came back they felt refreshed and could continue on with the remainder of the year‚Äôs work. I‚Äôve seen this type of thinking in a lot of jobs and it is so problematic. 

First, a vacation doesn‚Äôt fix the system that is perpetually exploiting you and demanding more and more. 

Second, this type of mentally is dangerous. For some it pacifies them, and they continue on for he one break they get a year. 

Also, most people are checking e-mails and getting calls from their bosses while on vacation. I‚Äôve even seen some people who were just staying home get called in to work because the bosses knew they were still in town. 

I remember telling one coworker, who had been at the company for six years and had recently gotten her own office so she was extra pro company, about my dream of teaching English in Thailand. And she said ‚Äúwhy? You could just take a vacation there and still work here.‚Äù 

And another reason it doesn‚Äôt work is because most Americans don‚Äôt take their full vacations. I was withholding taking it cause I wanted to get the monetary equivalent when I left, and some bosses guilt their employees about leaving and it‚Äôs never a good time.

I look around and I see it everywhere. Millions, billions of human beings slaving their lives away for a paycheck, only to end up struggling financially through their retirements. The greatest source of human potential, going untapped and wasted because we've been convinced that we have to play this insane game. 

Imagine what the world would look like tomorrow if we all stood up and said no. Claimed ownership of our lives and took control. Imagine the world in five years, ten years, if we stopped taking part in it. How we could change the job market, the housing market, policy.

My family thinks I'm still just young and naive, that it's a silly thing for me to say that a career is not an option for me. This community makes me know that I'm not just some over-principled child. The system is broken, and it has to change.

I've devised a plan to break my family from the chains of salary slavery. Using my talents, my unique abilities, and doing something that I enjoy. I work tirelessly to achieve it. I just wanted to say that this is maybe my favorite sub I've ever found, because it reinforces my belief that there's more to life than getting paid.

ce8z7r,I'm not going in tomorrow,"I work at a job with high stress, unsteady hours, no PTO, sick days or benefits. I have never once received a raise. Our old director played favorites quite often as he is best friends and roommates with a coworker; I struggle with my mental health, and taking time off was like pulling teeth. I found it hard to stand up for myself. 


Our owner recently hired a new director and the old one was transferred. Around the same time I decided to get sober, which is both good and bad. Good because I'm taking control of my life, bad because withdrawal sucks and comes and goes. A few hours ago I wrote my boss and asked if someone could cover my shift because I am ill (fatigue, insomnia, nausea, rapid heartbeat, close to vomiting, etc.). She basically told me no because it's a field trip day and they need me to drive one of the vans. My alarm was set for 6 am. I almost kept it that way. I thought about it, cancelled the alarm, and wrote her back. I told her that I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms (she knows about my substance abuse disorder and my sobriety) and am ill, and that I cannot come in but I do apologize for the challenge that may present for her. She wrote back and said she understood and to take care of myself. 


It is so important for us to take care of ourselves, physically and mentally. I have an hour and a half long drive to work, then more driving, with a van full of kids, to the pool in the hotass sun. I could not do it and will not push myself beyond my own limitations. I need to sleep, drink some water, take a shower and get better.

cdpfxt,I got my coworker a raise by arguing with my boss about wages. In front of everyone.,"I was talking to a coworker about over time. She said how she liked it because of how much she got paid. Then asked her,""Wait, how much do you get paid? I make x amount."" 

&amp;#x200B;

To which she looked irritated and said, ""Really? I make (less than me) amount.""

&amp;#x200B;

And I said, ""Man that's some bullshit. Store down the corner is hiring for more than I make. How long have you been here?""

&amp;#x200B;

I found out literally twice as long as I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I turned to another co worker as boss was walking past, ""How much do you make?""

&amp;#x200B;

He said same amount as first co worker even though he been there longer than me.

&amp;#x200B;

And then my boss went on about how we don't talk about stuff like that and how it's not appropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

I replied how there is a law saying that I absolutely can talk about this in front of everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

He got really mad and told me to show him the law. So I quick looked it up. It's the National Relation Labor Act. It forbids employers from punishing employees for talking about their salaries. Employees are absolutely allowed to talk about their wages anywhere even on the clock during work. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he looked it over and said I was right but why would I want to do that as it would cause negative emotions amongst the workplace. I wasn't very well prepared to defend my stance so he was winning the debate. And I say debate because he was very civil with me and let me speak.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my defense was that employers should pay fair wages in the first place and be loyal to their employees.

&amp;#x200B;

His was that if people know others wages then they'll be upset and leave.

&amp;#x200B;

\*We\* know that employers should just pay their employees for wages if they don't want them to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

But I couldn't articulate that very well.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I had to go back to my work so our debate was cut in half. By the way, all my coworkers around us were clearly uncomfortable since people generally don't talk back to their bosses about wages. But part of the law is if I'm punished for it then I can take their asses to court. So I was honestly hoping they would try some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I said to him stuck with him because like an hour later my co worker comes up to me all happy and said, ""Thank you so much for earlier!""

&amp;#x200B;

""What about causing a scene?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah! I just got a raise!""

&amp;#x200B;

Ya'll. She now makes as much as me. I'm so fucking happy. Now the other co worker heard this and said he's gonna go ask for a raise. It literally pays to know your employee rights.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such bullshit that there had to be law passed saying you can talk about this stuff. Why can't I? Why is it such an issue when everyone knows how much I make? Oh, that's right, cause then they'll get mad at their employers and demand a fair wage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cdpfxt/i_got_my_coworker_a_raise_by_arguing_with_my_boss/,1563234769.0,274,0.98,26,antiwork,Glttrnthclb

cd4c7j,Somewhat escaped the rat race,"I've been antiwork ever since I entered university and started learning about careers in the major I (mistakenly) chose - accounting. During my last year at school, I was crippled by anxiety about my future. While most of my friends had jobs in the industry at graduation, I decided to take a few months off and continue thinking about my options.

Randomly, I learned about teaching abroad, and having no other options, I booked a one-way ticket to Vietnam. Well over a year later, I'm still here. I work around 30 hours a week. The admin work is annoying, and teaching can be exhausting. But, I don't have to work mornings, the job is pretty low-stress, and the pay is great by Vietnamese standards.

There are literally no jobs in the US that would allow me to support myself comfortably on a 30 hour workweek, so I feel like I have to stay in Asia for the rest of my working life. 

It's sad that I can't live in my own country and have the kind of life that I want.

cccsz2,"I hate the system of school, work and today¬¥s society."," 

So, I am being forced to wake up early in the morning, 7:30 to do the same tasks, again and again and again until I do it for four more years, and then I get a lot of debt in my back, become a wageslave to feed the rich, and die... sounds pretty fun right?\\s. But now seriously, I am being forced to do mindless repetitive tasks with no value on the real world (contrary to popular belief) until I become a wageslave, and die, while millions, if not *billions* of people, children and teenagers are suffering with murder, evil, death, depression, mental illness, schizophrenia, war crimes, hate, racism, death and... etc. I could write a damn book about what¬¥s wrong with this world!

We are forced to deal with asshole teachers, bullies, forced to do tests that don¬¥t have anything to do with ACTUAL effort in life, like finding your passion, paying bills, mental health, cleaning, cooking food, murdering your asshole boss, mortgage and other things, and they *still* wonder why our youth doesn¬¥t end up right?

They make a lot of lectures about depression, suicide prevention, bullying... BUT THEY NEVER SEEM TO ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM! All they do is just talk about how ""oh talk to your teacher"", but they don¬¥t do anything. They talk about how depression must be taken care of but they don¬¥t know that the school environment, w*ay too much*homework, climate change, and the e*ntire* system overall is the cause for it! They also forcefully send suicidal high school, middle school and even elementary school students to psych wards, and put a bunch of bills on their family, because hey let¬¥s help suicidal people by giving them MORE reasons to kill themselves right buddy?\\s.

&amp;#x200B;

  

But you know what¬¥s *really* wrong about this? The way they sell it as a good thing! They say that you need the school system to become good in life... wich is a lie! I have a kid in my class wich pretty much doesn¬¥t pay attention to class and just draws in his notebook, and his drawings are... pretty good actually. I think it would be HILARIOUS if he ended up being a famour artist while the other people that were the ""nice students"" ended up being wageslaves that drank down lots of alcohol in order to cope with the regret of their degree. Oh the irony! Just wait about the crushing college bills!

Talking about bills, college is being pushed so much on today¬¥s youth because universities need more money. The amount of crippling debt that always tortures you while you work at your 12 hours job for 1 cent an hour is to give more money to the rich, and universities. This is why capitalism is in its *late stage,* and shall collapse soon... Wich I don¬¥t really see as an problem really.

But people still send their children towards this? They still send children towards this world, that they will know will not get any better soon? How could someone, in their right mind, think that having kids in this world is worth it? It¬¥s insane! I still will not get over this insane, corrupt system, that is brainwashing more and more people worldwide, all for their profit! The imminent collapse of civilization will be the end of this, and I don¬¥t mind it.

cal7p3,I just can't manage this,"I work a typical 8-5 office job and it's slowly killing me. I'm trying to live healthier but its exhausting. Always having to buy fresh groceries costs more than $1 frozen pizzas and the fact that WE have to spend hours from our already small weekends just to meal prep for the whole week, instead of our rich companies helping us with things like fruit salads or nuts, and not tons of cheap snacks or junk food. 

Our obsession with time is concerning. Earth is 4,5 billions of years old and the average human has a life expectancy of 80yo. We are not even 2% of this timeline yet we act like we're 200%. You have to clock in on specific times, not a minute more. Your breaks are exactly 60min, you have to work 8 hours even if 6 of them are empty sitting around. If you don't follow these rules, you lose your job and risk being homeless. I'm not saying ""lets abolish time!!"" but why is it taken that ridiculously serious?!

It's so clear that we live in a disturbed world. Sure, you could say ""find a job you like blah blah"" but that doesn't erase the fact, that theres still millions of people working minimum wage, medical bills having ABSURD prices, increasing suicide rates, I could name more but it's obvious. 

I struggle to find happiness, I have no time for emotions or spiritual growth. Work has taken over my life like a lethal parasite or maybe I'm just a weak human being. My ideology has changed to anti consumerism &amp; anti natalism so I'm gonna start donating money, to give someone else in need a chance of a better life (If you know any helpful sites, let me know). Realising that anti natalism was the right way for me, made me sad since my life goal, ever since I can think, was to have a family but it's for the better. Kids don't deserve to be fooled into having a great life just to end up in a brutal cycle of deadly capitalism, war &amp; meaningless competiton. I wasn't asked to be born but now I have to be a part of this since I have to help me and my family to survive. I want our voices to be heard by others but I have no idea where to start.

c9uhn9,"The wage worker is a slave of a class, not a single capitalist boss","I was reading a post and this thought occurred to me:

The worker is not a slave of any capitalist. Quite the opposite, she can quit her job and soon find another. For this reason, she enjoys a certain level of freedom and we call her a free laborer. But free she may be, she must find work somewhere:

&gt;The worker leaves the capitalist, to whom he has sold himself, as often as he chooses, and the capitalist discharges him as often as he sees fit, as soon as he no longer gets any use, or not the required use, out of him. But the worker, whose only source of income is the sale of his labour-power, cannot leave the whole class of buyers, i.e., the capitalist class, unless he gives up his own existence. He does not belong to this or that capitalist, but to the capitalist class; and it is for him to find his man ‚Äì i.e., to find a buyer in this capitalist class. [K. Marx, Wage Labor and Capital]

c8fttm,Money and/or a career is required to be part of society,"You're either born into money or you work your ass off for it, that's the story we've all been told. There is another option that many people don't like to mention though, for fear of hurting your friends and loved ones, and that is to remove yourself from the equation. I've worked the last 7 years in Software Development, building a little career for myself, I have a wife, a dog, and the makings of what looks like a 'happy' life, but I've recently found myself unemployed as of this March. Since that time I have searched and literally chased after the jobs I thought I could excel at, for companies that I admired and knew my skills would be useful with. I must have went wrong somewhere because those last 7 years have meant nothing in the eyes of the people who glanced over my resume. I've experienced rejection after rejection from the lowest IT work I could find, to the most suitable job for my skills, i'm a polyglot, and although not the absolute BEST at one language, I'm full stack and I certainly know well more than one and have a specialty for 3D graphics.. None of this matters though.  


I've come to accept this reality, and recently began applying for unskilled labor, retail, and food positions. Those positions scoff at my career resume because I must be overqualified right? I'm the only one showing up to these interviews in a three-piece suit, I have had managers say to my face that they won't hire me because they already assume I won't take their job seriously if I'm getting paid $10/hour. I try my best to wear a happy face and let them know I'm OK with minimum wage, it's all I can get right now. At this point I'm finding it hard to care about living, my wife hates me for losing my job, my parents think I'm lazy (""Just hit the bricks, it's time to man up""), my friends will think i'm a loser once they know i'm working in these kind of jobs after being a Software developer for 7 years, where did my worth go?  


The only thing I have left is my self-worth, I know I'm good, I know what I deserve, but that doesn't get you where you want to be - Am I a victim of circumstance? I don't worry anymore because I know there is another option I haven't been considering: Remove myself from the equation. When society doesn't want you, you don't have to be apart of it, you can remove yourself from living in this morbid reality.   


Thanks for reading and if you're like me, just know that suicide is always an option no matter how bad things get. Your life shouldn't be subjected to depression like this, and when people in your life (AND RANDOM STRANGERS) try to convince you not to kill yourself, then remember that you are living FOR YOU and that your pain is meaningful- people trying to convince you otherwise are trying to continue that pain.  


The only thing I've worried about today is who I will let take care of my dog after i'm gone and it hurts me to know he will miss me, it just doesn't outweigh the pain I already feel for myself. I've contemplated a myriad of ways to commit suicide and decided upon a painless one, albeit gruesome. Death by train, laying your neck over a track at night, let it ride over you, it will be instant and painless. I'm not sorry for whoever witnesses it or has to clean it up because this is the morbid reality we live in and it's time to accept it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c8fttm/money_andor_a_career_is_required_to_be_part_of/,1562105475.0,66,0.88,21,antiwork,wdkkmpz

c7qkjw,"[Rant] You know those comments here that recommend on the Fi/RE movement, as an escape route from the hell that is full-time work? Here is what they're neglecting to tell you","(I am not an expert. I'm the exact opposite, actually. Please don't rely on this and go see a professional before making any decisions).

Whenever someone starts a thread here and shares the frustrations of the modern imprisonment system called ""work"", there's usually at least 1 comment that says *""look into the FI/RE movement"".*

**Well, I finally did.**

I had to: my savings started amounting to a decent enough amount of money, so that I had to start thinking about it. I'm not a big spender type - just minor conveniences here and there, to relieve the pain of wasting my life away in a boring office role.

I've been saving \~50% of my take-home pay easily, and the interest I get for a savings account at the bank is pathetic - about 1%, less than the rise in the cost of living. A financial advisor warned me that by letting the money just sit there, it effectively depreciates as cost of living grows. To put it simply, I'm losing money by stalling.

**The idea of FI/RE is that every dollar you don't spend matters, thanks to compound interest.** There are compound interest calculators online, that show you, for example, that $10,000 today, with a standard interest of 5%, would equate to $16,500 in a decade. Some investors can supposedly get more than the basic %5-6, if they play their cards right, perform research etc.

**But where does the 5%-or-higher interest come from exactly?**

Your bank is not likely to pay you that much for your savings account. Here, the larger banks pay a LOT less.

Some smaller banks I found pay as much as %3.5, which is also somewhat low (and perhaps a bit riskier - I've seen one bank collapse in my days as a teenager).

Then, what is considered a 'safe investment', which also pays the a significant enough interest to allow one to dream of early retirement?

\*\*\*

The answer most FI/RE types quote is **ETFs**.

I'm not an expert, but from what I read - an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund, traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. Instead of picking a stock one by one, investors can pick a fund that tracks multiple companies at once. The popular ones, which are considered ""safe"" (and often have lower management fees) track the performance of financial market indexes. You don't have to be an expert, and you don't have to hire professionals to manage your investments, which would offset all the profit if you're just an average Joe with a few grands.

Here in Australia, there are a few that track the top 200-300 ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) companies. Investors that rather put their money in the global market often choose ETFs that track Standard &amp; Poor's index ([S&amp;P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)).

Those are just two examples, and there are many other options out there - but those are very common suggestions to people who have no financial background, can't manage the money by themselves, are risk averse etc.

And the problem?

**Once you check which companies those funds track exactly, you see what exactly you're investing in. From my perspective, they're the axis of evil. You're essentially betting on companies that do bad things.**

Here are some examples from the list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 index:

1. **Accenture** \- an IT company that hires bad-yet-cheap software developers in countries like India, as contractors; which in turn allows other companies to offshore their IT services and fire staff. I've seen that before.
2. **Activision Blizzard** \- we've had a few links on this sub around their latest shenanigans. Around Christmas, they [fired 800 employees](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/fire-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-for-pocketing-millions-while-laying-off-800-workers), to make up for the quarterly losses - while their CEO was paid 28 million a year, for his supposedly-stellar performance.
3. **Alphabet Class A and C** \- those are the guys that gather obscene amount of information on us all, track our every online move, in order to brainwash us with ads and perpetuate consumerism.
4. **Amazon** \- their founder is the richest man on the planet, yet Bernie Sanders had to win a long battle in order to convince him to pay his warehouse staff $15 an hour. In U.K., an investigative journalist revealed that picker-packers in Amazon warehouses, whose every move is under constant surveillance lest they slack a little on the clock, [pee in BOTTLES](https://nypost.com/2018/04/16/amazon-warehouse-workers-pee-into-bottles-to-avoid-wasting-time-undercover-investigator/). They have to, in order to save time and keep their metrics up. Else they'd lose their job.
5. **Apple** \- manufactures their iPhones in Foxconn factories in China, where staff are paid very little and have a high [suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract) rate.

That's just the letter A. The list is FULL of corporations that are famous for doing **nasty things for profit**.

Here are some more examples, after I scrolled down the whole thing:

* **Phrama companies** that have pushed opioids and hid the fact they're addictive from the public.
* **Oil companies**. I spotted multiple fossil fuel names.
* **Health care** providers in U.S., who lobby hard against public health care, inflate the cost of health services and fight every patient's claim.
* Some of the **banks and financial institutes** that caused the GFC are in the list. The guys who got bailed out by the U.S. government, then took the bailout money and paid HUGE bonuses to their execs.
* Someone in the comments added that there are **arms dealers** in S&amp;P 500 too. Next to those companies, Facebook and McDonald‚Äôs are relative saints. 

\*\*\*

Let's assume you're just about the money, and not letting this bother your conscience. Not judging.

You have to do what you can to survive in a capitalist economy, and you can't afford to reject the safest path to early retirement.

But who‚Äôs to say these companies are going to not just last, but grow, in 10, 20, 30 years? Especially the petroleum names in the list. Whose to say the banking system and the U.S. health care system will be the same by then?

I almost hope it won't. **In order to be optimistic about the success of your investment, you have to be quite pessimistic about the direction that the world is heading to**, and assume that our society won't improve; that we won't kick the bad, destructive habit of fossil fuel. Even Amazon's Bezos recently held a presentation about manning Mars; since he thinks we'll consume the resources here eventually, because we don't want to turn to ""rationing"" (his bleak interpretation on the degrowth movement, perhaps).

There are some alternatives, and you can probably build an ""ethical"" investment portfolio and choose less-horrible companies or indexes etc. The management fee will be far higher, and it's considered a less-safe path. Most investors don't. I see the same 3-letter acronyms on FI/RE forums, the same funds people discuss.

And they're all cancer. Lucrative cancer, at least for the time being.

\*\*\*

I'm still doing it, don't get me wrong. Billy Corgan said, ""despite of my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage"". If that's my ticket out of work, I can't afford to be ethical.

I would have bought real estate instead, but I don't have enough money to buy a tiny studio within less than an hour of my workplace (one of the axis-of-evil companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, btw). I don't think I ever will, lest I sink in debt and work for 30 years. And the majority of the population here earns less than me.

I guess I'm just venting here. But the next time someone posts that if you skip that one cappuccino or Spotify subscription, you'd be able to retire early - please be aware that they're not telling you the whole story. They're not telling you that you'd have to embrace a sickly economic  system, and hope for the best.

**TL;DR - the FI/RE movement's promise relies on the success of the least ethical companies in the world.**

c6ndwn,Andrew Yang is not antiwork.,"I‚Äôve noticed a surprising number of Yang Gang posts on this sub in the past 24 hours, so I felt that someone should set the record straight on who this guy actually is and what he believes.

Andrew Yang is a Silicon Valley robber baron- excuse me, I mean, ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù - whose fan base mostly includes meme-obsessed 4chan denizens. His chief philanthropic accomplishment before running for President was creating [fewer than 4,000 jobs](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/13/18637853/andrew-yang-venture-for-america-jobs-record) from a venture that promised to create 100,000. 

Yang‚Äôs signature policy proposal is a ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù - basically a $1,000.00 handout to every single American. However, this UBI-like proposal would be funded through [a 10% value-added tax](https://thebaffler.com/latest/andrew-yangs-war-on-normal-people-simpson) on goods and services. [This tax would be regressive](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-would-bear-burden-vat), hitting poor people far harder than the wealthy. Under this scheme - and it *is* a scheme in the most nefarious sense - poor people would essentially be paying money to themselves, while the rich are further absolved of their responsibility to give back to the commons.

Additionally, there is no evidence that a Yang-style UBI would reduce the proliferation of bullshit work. Indeed, [Daniel Zamora‚Äôs comprehensive analysis of UBI](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/12/universal-basic-income-inequality-work) in *Jacobin* suggests a scenario where the *exact opposite* would occur:

&gt;	Martinelli highlights ‚Äúthe danger that basic income ‚Äòwould aggravate the problem of low pay and subsidize inefficient employers,‚Äô leading to a proliferation of ‚Äòlousy‚Äô jobs.‚Äù In this scenario, those with good jobs will continue to lead fulfilling lives, now supplemented by universal income, while others will have to combine their UBI with one or more ‚Äúlousy‚Äù jobs, with little gain in income. The proposal makes no attempt to help those without a job today get one tomorrow or improve the job they have. **Indeed, everything suggests that the opposite will happen: the UBI will function like a war machine for lowering wages and spreading precarious work.**

(Emphasis mine)

In other words, the ‚ÄúFreedom Dividend‚Äù would, conveniently for Yang and his billionaire Silicon Valley compatriots, more-or-less subsidize and expand the gig economy. 

There are more socialist/anarchist arguments against UBI that I won‚Äôt get into in this post - the major ones are that it would deflate class consciousness and act as a gigantic handout to the landlord class - but those are beyond the scope of this post. My point is, dont fall for Andrew Yang and his army of 4chan memelords. They are not our allies.

**UPDATE 6/29: It‚Äôs been fun, Yang Gang, but I‚Äôm not going to reply to any more posts in this thread. You‚Äôve proven yourselves to be the exact sort of personality-cultists that I thought you were. I‚Äôll just leave you with this thought: If you‚Äôre *really* interested in a 2020 candidate who possesses decades of history involving standing up for working and marginalized people, a consistent theory of extra-electoral change and proposals for concrete plans that would aid all of us, and who explicitly shirks the sort of personality cultism that Yang thrives on, then I‚Äôd suggest looking into a certain Vermont Senator as an alternative.

c6fb25,The death of the 8-hour work day,"How many people even work 8 hours anymore? I've only worked hourly, which seems what most people get nowadays, and it always comes with the asterisk of an extra 30 min to hour of lunch. It's never 9-5 anymore. It's 8-5, or 9-6:30. 
It drives me nuts. It's so negligable, but it's ultimately a slap in the face to the 8 hours to work, 8 hours to sleep, 8 hours to do as we please. Never enough to truly relax, of course. Often not enough to let you even go home. Just enough to fulfill a quota to let your employer off the hook, while you spend that extra 30 min to an hour at the end of your shift so desperately wishing you can go home.

Hourly is supposed to be part-time. 8 hours includes breaks and lunch for salary jobs. It's one more example of employers taking advantage, and it pisses me off the more I think of it. 40 hours a week is a big difference from 45, and when you think about all the overtime and the time it takes to commute, it adds up and you can very easily be working about 50 hours a week.

c5at1c,People at work are treating me like some kind of contagious leper for searching for new employment.,"Several places contacted me for interviews and I decided to be honest about the reason I‚Äôm leaving work early. 

My husband made the mistake of feigning illness to attend an interview. His old boss found out after the potential new employer contacted his current job as a reference check and it backfired on him. Hence, honesty.

Anyhoo, since then, people here have been cold. These are coworkers who I would normally chat with or joke around with. 

For instance, I had a Spinal Fusion surgery in March. While I‚Äôm somewhat improved, (no sciatica - yay!) I'm still in intense pain from scar tissue in my back. What does this have to do with my post? My job evolved to me being an occasional driver by taking teens to the local college two blocks away.

This was never in my original job description but I did it because well, two blocks away. Recently, being summer, the local campus closed. The next closest one is over 45 minutes away (one way). This was a huge concern due to my back still having bad spasms. I emailed my surgeon and asked her opinion because a.) I would be in the car for several hours between regular commute and driving to campus b.) I would have a teen in the vehicle with me. I would feel awful if my back locked up and I got into an accident.

Surgeon was appalled that I would even ask; it was an absolute no. She wrote me a note to limit my driving; I was covered. Big Brother (boss) lost it. I was sent an angry email. BB was puzzled. Wasn‚Äôt I cleared to drive? Didn‚Äôt I tell coworkers I could start biking or kayaking? 

\*Record scratch\* Wait, coworkers ran to BB to tell what I did on my own time. Alone. Not responsible for another human during work. I felt betrayed by these people I thought were my work friends. 

I felt like I had to explain why I was able to do these things on my own time. I could bike or kayak for five minutes at a time. I could stop if fatigued. There was no stopping on the Interstate. Explain I did. Then I felt mad that I needed to justify myself. 

Since my interviews, people have been distant or downright unfriendly.

Well my dad has to pee A LOT. He's getting older, he has injuries, (not work related) he hurts constantly and he doesn't ask for much just to be left alone and he'll work hard if you just tell him what you want done.

But see modern society doesn't tell you, they just expect you to know and live in a constant state of fear. Oh you can bet someone will be there to tell you wrong, but never to explain in depth what could have avoided this. Now as we establish my dad admits his mistakes. Like his boss got on him one time when I picked him up for work because he was leaving as the other security was in the bathroom. That was his relief but until that relief physically plants themselves down he is not to leave the premise. He was like ok I understand. It's never come up again and he just asks me to park to the side and wait and he'll walk to the car despite how he hurts.

But the man pees like every half hour to an hour, he can't be waiting around for someone to permit him to go to the bathroom and sit in his spot when there's only like two guards. So I was there when it happened as I just dropped him off. He ran to go pee, comes out, and his boss is bitching at him in front of everyone and he was like ""I'm not even technically signed in yet"" but since there was no officer at the gate house, his ass was to be right there whether he had to pee or not. He tried to defuse the situation by mentioning how he never got his new uniforms or there were some items missing, but they saw right through that trying to change the subject. So after he said they were gonna write him up for you know, having basic biological needs that can't be avoided for long, he was like fine whatever.

He needs an income, but like i said he's a stubborn one. He was mad the whole night but as soon as he got home he started packing bottles and his hookah in my old school backpack. I was like what are you doing

""They don't want me to leave? I ain't leaving. I'm going to smoke the whole God damn night, I'm going to piss in these bottles, and if there's an emergency sorry, can't leave the gate house for any reason.""

Last post he was at he said it felt like being homeless anyway 11 hours outside rain, snow, or heat. So if they fire him oh well. He only works because he doesn't want to be a burden on us and make his own money, and that's where trying to do right by other people gets you. Stepped on and a gun pointed at your head at all times.

He's the first to admit fuck boomers, they ruined literally everything and no modern convenience measures up to half the bullshit put up with to keep it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/byghtr/my_dad_is_being_written_up_for_using_the_bathroom/,1560053817.0,89,0.98,3,antiwork,Bravelady16
byfghb,HR seemed incredulous that I don‚Äôt want to work 6 days a week.,"I work at a very large nonprofit. I won‚Äôt say the name, but you all have heard of it. I‚Äôm salaried, so once in a while there‚Äôs really no choice but to put in extra hours. I‚Äôve made it pretty clear that every time that happens, I‚Äôm taking flex time. So far, it hasn‚Äôt been much of an issue except for some slight bitching from management, but whatever. 

Schedules are getting switched around for the summer and the person who normally works on Sunday cannot anymore, so I found someone to work as a Sunday contractor. In the meantime, I have to work a few Sunday‚Äôs to train the new person.

I went to HR yesterday to ask how to set a contractor up in our system to get paid. HR lady starts asking very pointed questions like, ‚ÄúWell, can your department afford that?‚Äù Yes. ‚ÄúAre you sure? You run on a shoestring budget.‚Äù 

So I kind of laugh and say, ‚ÄúWell I already work Saturdays and don‚Äôt really want to work 6 days a week all summer, so yeah, we‚Äôre getting a contractor for Sunday‚Äôs.‚Äù 

And then she gives me this long disapproving look, then launches into a needlessly dramatic diatribe about how difficult it is to do, how expensive it is (it‚Äôs for five hours a week at $12/hr with no benefits, we are a rich worldwide organization, the fuck you mean?), and was I SURE?

At the time I just sort of shrugged it off but now I think, wtf? We already flaunt a whole bunch of labor laws (no breaks, ten minute lunches, working a shitload of overtime for no money) and you also want me to work all weekend, every weekend, with one day off because you think the paperwork you have to do is too complicated? FUCK YOU. 

Nonprofit work will suck you the fuck dry and not in a good way. They‚Äôll use your ‚Äúpassion‚Äù as the reason for treating you like shit and underpaying you. I was wary about this job because I‚Äôve worked at ‚Äúfamous‚Äù places before because these places use their name as justification for treating you like shit (‚ÄúYou have a cool job! Just deal with it!‚Äù)

Fuck all of it. Bad management, no money, and bullshit like this. I can‚Äôt wait to get my small business off the ground because even though I know there will still be bullshit, at least it‚Äôll be my bullshit.

byc6md,Living for the weekend is a depressing rollercoaster of a life,"I know it has probably been said before here.

I legitimately hate the work week.  I gradually get happier as the week goes along just because I can fucking sleep in on the weekends and not have to deal with corporate bullshit.   I usually stay up until really late in the a.m. Even on week nights working on my hobbies that I'm passionate about and trying to turn into a career.  It's such a slow process though and I need to put the hours in to succeed.  Work only makes it harder for me to not only find the time to engage in that hobby, but energy as well.  I ended up a caffeine addict just so I can have the energy to do what I love when I get home dealing with the corporate whip.  

I'm much happier when the weekend rolls around, but even in the back of my head I know that it won't last long.  I get very sudden glimpses of depression just based on the fact that I know it will be short-lived so why even be happy about it.  Sunday night is one of the most depressing nights of the week for me going from fun mode to having to wake up early and miserable once again.

I have no desire to even ""get a deeper education"" or go through hoops for another dollar an hour. I just can't believe the human species thinks this is progress, that this is intelligent. Well the truth of the matter is, the world is ran by a bunch of greedy wealth inheritance cunts who inflate everything and invented their ultimate weapon called ""interest rates"".

I hate that I tried to go down the IT technician route. I am to blame, its not all its cracked out to be. I think for all the knowledge you accumulate you are paid too little and its another job that isn't unionized , even though internet, hardware and software are a utility.

I worked a telcom job for 7 months under a temp agency(I had no choice I was desperate) and it didn't reflect my education, but under a hot plate, I was able to adapt and stay there. I was fired because the temp agency was incompetent and didn't impress their customer. I was contracted for a pathetic Mc pay of $16 an hour and they paid me that wage after my contract expired until they fired me 1 month later. 8 other temp employees were fired, I was the best one out of the eight, but they said ""fuck it leave here douche bag"".

bvw1yp,The system for being in highly skilled professions like art is a complete joke.,"You have artists who spend 10,000+ hours to get as good as they are.  Only to end up in some shitty company that rips them off and treats them like shit.  Always hopping from job to job and living paycheck to paycheck.

You have some 3D artist who devotes their entire life into mastering the craft, they make all this cool shit and finally get hired. They're super excited and finally get to live the ""dream"" working at rockstar or some other big company.

Reality check, that artist is sculpting rocks for the game and has been sculpting rocks for the past 5 months and is just one of many cogs. His creative talent is completely wasted and he has no say or input on the direction his project goes.

You know who has control over the creative decisions of these projects? Some manager who knows fuck all about art.  The reality of being an artist is a fucking joke for most people, and I think our society doesn't want to admit it. What is the point to being an artist, if you can't even use your creativity? 

It's all because our world is revolved around ""money"" that our artists are either working at starbucks or are stuck making the same generic shit as everyone else because the ones in charge who actually decide what will be in any given project, have no creativity their self.  So basically it's just a regular job except it required you to spend time mastering a hard skill, the only one who wins is the one in a higher position than you who gets to reap the benefits of all your hard work without having to do it their self.

buwxg1,Hired on the Spot and then Fired Immediately,"Edit: Formatting mistake, giant blob of text.

So as the post title said, I went to an interview at a local branch of a company who's expanding their operation, and was hired on the spot. My work experience just prior to this was at a very successful company with a good reputation, and I had glowing recommendations coming from my previous bosses. I went into the interview knowing full well I was overqualified for the job, as my last job was doing basically the exact same thing, but I didn't expect to get hired on the spot.

Side Note: In my experience, hiring on the spot is actually not a good sign, it means the company might be more desperate than they're willing to admit.

But anyway, I tell her more prior work info and start filling out the legal hiring forms, but then the interviewer starts asking me weird or even possibly illegal-to-ask questions. ""So other than yourself, who requires you to be employed?"" Even at the time I knew this was a red flag, so I know this interview (which again, was technically over, as I was filling out hiring information) was gonna get awkward real quick. 

For the sake of my own clarification/sanity, I somehow worked up the nerve to ask her a few questions as well, ""so what's the next step from here?"" Interviewer lady says she'll *submit my paperwork to my new boss,* and he will contact me on Wednesday about drug testing and a start date. This was also a red flag to me, why would my new boss need to see my resume and cover letter and prior experience? Is he somehow involved in the hiring process? Something about that just seemed real out of place to me, but I thought maybe it was just some weird, unorthodox hiring procedure.

Anyway, the interview ends, my paperwork is filled out. Wednesday comes around, and guess fucking what? They retracted their employment offer. Not gonna lie, it was like a movie where I read the email like 3 times to actually comprehend it. My brain starts going a million miles an hour trying to figure out what went wrong:

-Failed Background Check? Nope, never been arrested or in trouble, not even a traffic ticket.
-Former bosses said something unbecoming of me? No, I worked with them a long time and they were also my friends, definitely wasn't that.
-Something wrong on my resume or cover letter? Nope, double checked and it all looks good.
-Did I say something wrong? No, don't think so, I wouldn't say I aced the interview but it definitely didn't go badly.

So then I start remembering the real minor details:

Interviewer was late to the interview, despite it being a time she told me and that we knew ahead of time for 2 weeks. Security guard accidentally slipped that she was in a meeting. She was in a meeting at the same time she was supposed to interview me, at a time *she* set.

Employees seem to be coming in late as I was waiting for the interviewer to show up. And not like 1 or 2, but like 20 kept filing in and going through security. No idea why.

When I first walked in, I had to correct her on some things she misunderstood about my previous employment it seems like she did some research on my last job, but some of the things she **ASS** **U** **ME** ed were objectively wrong, my last workplace manufactured things in a proprietary way and she just researched the industry standard way of doing things. I literally specifically mentioned that on my resume as well, so I don't know if where she went wrong there. Again, looks like she was winging it.

Call me cocky, but I think I was fired out of their own incompetence. Their being late to the interview and then not understanding the things I mentioned when contacting her earlier, I don't know what else to call it.

bsykge,Wage slavery leads me to suicide,"Hello everyone.

I am glad I've found a community of people who share my ways of looking at life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need to speak out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm living in poor country, average salary in my country is **200-400$**, cost of apartment is approximately **30 000$**.

And there is just one big town with good / normal works. 

There isn't any allowance for unemployed or disabled people. You don't have money - then you are homeless. 

Actually maybe there is, but I know that allowance is so low, you can't live an that money, especially if you don't have your own home.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything I did in my life I did just to earn more money, so I can buy several apartments and rent them out, so I can live free and buy time, buy freedom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my work and I never wanted to do now what I do for living.  And it's not just the work, it's the system we all live in. System where you have to work and you can't stop if you don't have money.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always hated work for hire, from the very first day and even before I started working, so I don't see reasons to change work, actually I am earning 2 or 3 times more of an average salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought high salary somehow will compensate the time I am spending for work.

Well, it doesn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even read a fiction book or play on some video game because I have so little time for this and I can't stop thinking about next day. 

The day I will have to go to the work I hate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spending time at entertainment for me it's like I am eating gourmet dish but instead of restaurant I am sitting in a public toilet. That's how I feel, and it's even worse than not to entertain myself at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough money to live free for 2 years. 

I want to read all the books, watch all the movies, play all the games I have planned, go to Amsterdam, use psychedelics and then kill myself.  


I am used to certain way of life and comfort and becoming a homeless for me is worse than death. 

 

I think it's sad that I want to spend my last years of life for escapism.

When did my life became so fucking boring and shitty? I can't even remember when was the last time I felt just ""normal"".

&amp;#x200B;

And I think this is the first time in my life I am thinking about suicide so seriously.

I feel constant anxiety for years and I can't stop it.

I am so tired, fucking system broke me and I can't find any reason to endure my life, except one thing

&amp;#x200B;

I want to play The Wither 3 one more time. That's how good this game is.

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.** Recently I saw an awesome movie - **Capharna√ºm**. The main idea of the film is so close to me.

Having children in this shitty world, doom them to suffering is a crime and everyone who have children must burn in hell!",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bsykge/wage_slavery_leads_me_to_suicide/,1558812999.0,90,0.92,41,antiwork,s1lav3

bs2z4b,Unemployment Does Not Mean You Are Worthless,"There is a capitalist cultural stigma that surrounds unemployment to mean you are undesirable, undeserving, and unqualified. This stigma is strong enough to take a toll on mental health (depression, anxiety, and sometimes even suicide). 

We live in a unjust system that can never define our humanity. Don't let it define you. Unfortunately, our material conditions may decline due to our lack of income, but we cannot make this a reflection of our value (as difficult as it may be). 

But this is somewhat impossible. There is a reason why classes remain in the same class for generation and does seep into individuals mentalities to some degree. This is a fight that really seems hopeless. 

But don't lose faith in what we are all fighting against. As r/antiwork as shown, work can alienate us to mundane machines that go against our humanity as well. We are forced into activities we do not want to do, but commit a portion of our lives to.

They are genuinely interested in the company and are willing to work until late unprompted. They think that their bosses are thinking about them and will recognize their effort.

bq7eqq,"When you think about it, having a career is ridiculous","A bunch of effort dumped into work just to make money. A lot of people think, ""Oh if I just work hard enough and I make myself likeable, I'll move up the corporate ladder and get rich!""

Everyone, society, parents, and teachers, trick you into thinking getting a college degree and having a steady job/career means you made it. No it fucking doesn't. Why do I need a job or a career? Just because it makes successful? Can't believe I fucking fell for this shit. I wish I just skipped college altogether and focused doing my own shit that way I wouldn't have been saddled with debt. Now I'm stuck with debt that I have to pay off. Don't even get me started with getting a car loan or mortgage. 

Office politics is a thing. Middle aged women love to gossip since they're past the college age drunkedness and are so bored at home. Power hungry men try to backstab you at any moment in order to look good and get brownie points for a future promotion. You have to broker alliances to even consider moving up. Sticking to yourself only makes you look like a loner, where people will just generate gossip or take advantage of you

Once you move up the ladder, you receive marginal pay increases but double the amount of responsibilities and duties. Your bosses are always on your ass and you gotta deal with potentially rebellious subordinates that you gotta keep in line or else your boss will demote you, fire you, or cut your pay. It only gets worse as you move up since the stakes are raised. This added stress is one of the reasons why managers always intrude into your personal life, they're only looking out for themselves and are looking to see who is the most vulnerable-looking or easily manipulated to work outside of their prescribed schedule. Show some balls and be ready to assert a firm ""No"" in real life before they even text you. Don't show them you are someone that always follows orders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bq7eqq/when_you_think_about_it_having_a_career_is/,1558205594.0,68,0.94,8,antiwork,fuckschool_22
bq6eh1,I thought I was insane. Then I found this sub.,"  I‚Äôm 31. The first major career type job I had was as a janitor for a state run facility. I did 6 years of that. The job included cleaning up bodily fluids, cigarette butts and receptacles, cleaning patient rooms. Stuff like that. The ‚Äúprofession‚Äù I found was demeaning to me. After some negative workplace relationships and leadership being subpar I left that job of 6 years. I took 2 years off to focus on myself and hopefully learn some more skills. When I was ready to go back into the workforce I told my mother my feelings about that kind of work but what I said basically went in one ear and out of the other. Several months down the line she asked me what my plans are. I said I have no idea. Then she suggested janitorial work. I started filling with rage at that. 
   I cannot be more clear in my feelings for that type of job. I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate cleaning up piss and shit for 12 dollars an hour. I hate cleaning infectious rooms and areas with no hazard pay. I hate getting up at 5am to commute in one of the worst counties to commute. Basically, this type of job drains me mentally and physically and I am so serious when I say I would rather die than pick up another cigarette butt. The whole thing about my ‚Äúprofession‚Äù is that it caters to people but guess what. If people would clean up after themselves my job would be nonexistent.
   But I still do it. I‚Äôm miserable, but at least everyone‚Äôs toilets are clean. 
   I thought I was the only one that felt like this. Everyone has the mentality that work is normal and expected of you to contribute to society. I fail to see how my profession accomplishes this.  
  Saying all of this brings me to this point. Thank you r/antiwork. I thought I was the only one being overwhelmed by ‚Äúduty‚Äù and expectations. I‚Äôve been lurking for a few days and I can honestly say you guys have helped me so much. The fact that there are like-minded people who feel like work is draining and sometimes useless and all-the-time unfair helps me to see other sides of the same story. I‚Äôve been in therapy because I thought something was wrong with me. Why can‚Äôt I find a job I like? Why can‚Äôt I get paid more for doing a somewhat important job? Why do people who sit behind desks all day make A LOT more money than I do? I‚Äôm the one breathing in chemicals all day. I‚Äôm the one swinging a mop until my shoulders are busted. I thought these questions were wrong and I was trying to figure out why I was the only one who was seeing this bullshit.
   Sorry for rambling (and also for formatting as I‚Äôm on mobile), but all I can say is thank you to this sub. You have helped me realize that I might not be so broken after all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bq6eh1/i_thought_i_was_insane_then_i_found_this_sub/,1558200086.0,280,0.98,54,antiwork,DurandelTheSword

bnlacp,The reason why most people don't seem to mind working.,"Is because they have no real hobbies or interests. All they do in their free time is lazy, recreational things like watching TV and drinking. Most of us are guilty of this as well because in what little free time we have it's the end of the day after a full shift and we don't have the time or energy to do anything above relaxing media consumption. The amount of memes I see about watching endless Netflix sessions should prove this. 

I have people tell me that they were bored when they were unemployed or if they won the lottery they would go back to work (!!). I think it's because they have no challenging hobbies or interests that require skill or effort. They just bum around in their free time and even the laziest people would be bored with no sense of purpose. Even if you are unemployed, you have no money to really do anything so you can't develop much in the way of skills and you certainly can't travel anywhere too far from your town or city.

If we only had more free time people could discover a whole world of things to do. There are far more skills, arts, hobbies, crafts and things to do than any one person could even scratch the surface of in a single lifetime, even with unlimited free time. Many people take decades to master a single skill such as a language, an instrument, writing novels, martial arts, building things etc.

I think it's a horrifying injustice that so much human potential is wasted with people believing its better to do mindlessly dull, soul drainingly boring and unfulfilling repetitive grunt work for almost no pay off besides small amounts of disposable income that is no where near the hours wasted and time lost; just for the sake of not ""being bored"" or ""having nothing to do"".

blz6df,Work is a Prison Sentence,"If you think about it (not very hard), modern work is jail.

Most of us spend our day in a cube (which honestly is going to be smaller than a jail cell) and you are forced to do the same damn tasks over and over again. This causes mind numbing boredom and exhaustion. This forms the great majority of your week, where driving to and from the cell takes up more of your time, but of course that time is not paid... sunrise to sunset, in a cube.

I feel like I am in jail at work. I don't have any freedoms. I am forced to obey, to do and answer to whatever tasks are placed on my desk. It is awful. I am a servant.  Sure you can try to escape to a different prison (a different company) but at the end of the day, 8 hours of prison is 8 hours of prison no matter where you go.

Most employers give you a whopping 2 weeks off per 52 week year. Like, are you kidding me? You will probably need more than that when you get sick and can't even come in. But that's all, that's what you get. Or maybe not, as more and more jobs become temp jobs which give you zero healthcare benefits and zero time off. Temp jobs are cancer on society.

You are also surrounded by drones who have no idea what is going on. They are clueless, they are smiling, and they ""enjoy"" slaving away to benefit those above. Your co-workers think you just have a bad attitude, that your an unpleasant person, as they smile and laugh with stupid memes and jokes.

Yes, you get to go home at the end of the day, but with drained energy and a horrible fatigue from dealing with another day of bullshit. The weekends are a chance to fuel up the battery so you can work yet another week. They have to give you that time off to take care of the other tasks required of a job (clean your clothes, get some food, fill the gas tank, pay those bills).

The system is designed without your interests in mind. It's designed to enslave you and drain you of all your energy. The job will over the years drive you crazy. It will rob you of your vital life energy and convert you to become a mindless, numb, miserable robot. Work is prison, but they have it so twisted that those who want out of work are looked at as lazy losers. Our society congratulates people for finding a new job, for getting promoted, and shames those who are fired or quit the endlessly spinning hamster wheel of corporate america. 

Every day ends up destroying me. I go in with some level of energy, and in one, two or three hours, I'm all drained out and ready to be home. Except I can't, the work day is 8 hours, not 2 or 3. It's 8 hours exactly, every single day, regardless of the day, regardless of how I feel.

bldfhw,A story about an American and a Mexican. Thought r/antiwork would enjoy it!,"An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican replied, ‚Äúonly a little while"". The American then asked why didn‚Äôt he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family‚Äôs immediate needs. The American then asked, ‚Äúbut what do you do with the rest of your time?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican fisherman said, ‚ÄúI sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.‚Äù The American scoffed, ‚ÄúI am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican fisherman asked, ‚ÄúBut, how long will this all take?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

To which the American replied, ‚Äú15 ‚Äì 20 years.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

bl64ej,If the minimum wage kept pace with depreciation of the dollar it would be $45 an hour today,"In 1970, the minimum wage was about $1.25. Today it is about $7.25. If some on the Left had their way, the minimum wage would be $15.

To see how low the Left sets it sights, we need only realize that in 1970 an once of gold went for $35. Today that same ounce of gold fetches $1250. Over the intervening 50 years gold hasn't become more valuable, the dollar's purchasing power has declined. 

This means your real wage has collapsed without you even realizing. In truth, to have the same standard of living your parents had working a minimum wage job in 1970, you would have to be earning $45 an hour today.

TL;DR I don't feel any bad about cheating but being around passionless drones seems to be bad to my wellbeing. I'm not from the USA.

I work in HR I'm a recruiter/administrative. My CV says that's I have 3 years of experience, all a lie, well, technically now I have 8 months of experience. I'm very good at faking it in the interview and in my CV, I only need maximum 2 weeks to get a new job. My degree is a easy but very creative trick. I went to university but for a very different degree.

I've fired 4 times this year, either because I stopped caring to pretend that I do the bare minimum or because management caught me before. I spend not more than 2 months in every job. I don't give a flying fuck about my job or anything related to it, at the beginning it was fun to watch how most of my coworkers cared too much about their ""bullshit"" job while I just chilled and said fuck it. But now is starting to be a burden; seeing how my coworkers don't have a life of their own, seeing how they are just drones that think that their bullshit job is appreciated outside of their meaningless circle of ""human resources bullshit"" now it seems an insult to life, an insult to living a life that is worth living.

Those bullshit jobs are just a stepping stone to me, I only need a little more money (2 months more) to invest and then I'm going to stop working full time, I'm going to use most of time on my personal projects and maybe in some eventual part time jobs. Being a bartender seems interesting. I do this kind of jobs because they are easy to get and I can slack most of the time. Getting a job related to my degree might take more time and maybe I will have to work seriously.

Have you received one of those annoying calls where someone try to sell you some garbage that you don't need and you clearly see how what they are selling is garbage and they are just waiting to get someone dumb enough to buy their garbage? I'm in the HR department in charge of this kind of positions. My coworkers think that finding someone desperate enough to take this kind of disgusting job is somehow and important duty.

I don't feel bad about cheating to get a job, I'm proud of finding holes in any kind of system and exploit them to my benefit (...and hoo boy, I've exploited a lot of different holes). But being around passionless drones seems to be bad to my wellbeing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/biscly/i_dont_give_a_fuck_about_work_ethic_and_i_cheat/,1556559674.0,106,0.92,15,antiwork,The_Pimp_Arcana

This planet has so many things to offer, the world is so fucking beautiful and yet we are stuck in +40 hour jobs that have no benefit, either to us or for anyone else. We are not humans anymore, we stopped seeing true beauty in life because of stupid CEO‚Äôs and laws that require us to sell our freedom for money, as the saying goes ‚Äúmoney is the root to all evil‚Äù

I would call it ‚ÄúVoluntary slavery‚Äù, nobody‚Äôs forcing you to work but you have to in order to survive. Of course there are great jobs that benefit the planet or us, such as firefighters or farmers, I‚Äôll always support them. 

I remember calling in sick some days ago because I had no motivation. I went out that day, had a walk in a garden full of flowers and just loved life so much. I recommend everyone to do that btw.

Anyways, a bit of sarcastic shitposting on a post by one of the many bland corporate white guys got a response, which lead to a phone call. I gladly took the opportunity to speak my mind.

He tried to seem all personable asking me about my history with the company, saying how he relates since he started at the bottom 25 years ago so he knows what it's like. Whatever. I got into my list of grievances, like why is it that the store does tens of thousands of dollars in sales weekly but I don't even get $1000 on my biweekly paycheck? How come a pregnant coworker had to cancel her company health insurance because it was far too expensive? Why do I have a full time coworker struggling to make ends meet between paychecks? Non answers all around. ""Well we've introduced paid maternal/paternal leave! Such great benefits!"" ""If you work hard you'll be able to move up in the company and make more money!"" Shit like that. I straight up asked how much he and the other executives are making but he dodged that question at breakneck speed.

bgnu32,"""They want your time... even if they have no use for it.""","So, I'm reading Bob Black's abolition of work (which I'm sure a lot of you have read, it's in the sidebar).  And I'm just completely struck by this passage:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because work is unnecessary except to those whose power it secures, workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively useless occupations as a measure to assure public order. Anything is better than nothing. **That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt go home just because you finish early. They want your** ***time*****, enough of it to make you theirs, even if they have no use for most of it.** Otherwise why hasn‚Äôt the average work week gone down by more than a few minutes in the past fifty years? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's both obvious and insightful.  It's something everybody knows is true - that workers are forced to pretend to be busy or make up bullshit to do rather than just leave or do their own thing when there's no actual work to do, and even much of the actual work is made up as an excuse to occupy them.  It's also something most people don't think about in that way.  Most people believe work is about contributing to society and doing useful things that need to be done, and this, I think, is an obvious counter to that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bgnu32/they_want_your_time_even_if_they_have_no_use_for/,1556065161.0,119,0.97,11,antiwork,Bookbringer

But upper management knew that handing someone three jobs would be extremely stressful, and they chose not to hire anyone else and also put a lot of pressure on this young woman. Whenever someone on the ground leaves, they don't replace them, but somehow have enough in the budget to hire more executives making six figures.

You don't really have to do anything, or put up with shitty co-workers...etc, you just have to be willing to go to various sites at short notice, and be able to handle being alone for 12+ hours. I would typically spend the shift watching films and TV shows, playing video games and vaping weed. Also some sites I could bring my dog with me, which was cool.

Eventually I was fired after I got caught sleeping, but at that point I'd had enough of the job and the company anyway so didn't really care.

bdmuv5,I haven‚Äôt had a job where the environment wasn‚Äôt abusive,"My first job at 16 I worked on a small organic farm. Was working by sunrise and went home at sunset. Got $70 a week. 

My next job was for a fast fashion retailer. It was my first ‚Äúreal job‚Äù so I was eager to please. They used my naitivite to their advantage and forced me to do extra work every day, all for minimum wage. 

My next job was for a non-profit. They exploited my youth and enthusiastic energy to make the world a better place to pay me like garbage.

I worked as a hostess for a few months. Predatory old men were the usual crowd I dealt with. What is with this trend of senile old fucks thinking they can trick young women into having sex with them? Do you want a table or not, sir? Don‚Äôt wink at me, your wife is standing right there. But I‚Äôm the hostess, I‚Äôm supposed to be sexually appealing so dumb bastards like that come buy overpriced entrees prepared by underpaid undocumented men in the kitchen working three jobs to support their families and the owners alcohol addiction and his elite friends‚Äô unpaid tabs.

I worked at a cookie chain known for being open late in my freshman/sophomore year. All my colleagues were sexual predators and I was the only girl who worked there. Seriously, one of the delivery drivers was 68 with a 19 year old wife. Whenever my manager was at the store he sat in a stool reserved for customers (we were written up for using them or sitting down in general, and they were always watching us on camera and would get calls from corporate telling us to stand up) playing fantasy baseball while we had lines of customers out the door. I ran the store by myself most days. My manager made sexual comments daily. 

I worked for a local bar and grill that had just opened since my friend was moving and she needed someone to replace her there. The most toxic work environment by far. The owner was a fucking creep. He would verbally abuse us (all young women) in front of customers daily. He was always high on pills and/or coke. He made sexual remarks constantly. He was okay with ‚Äúregulars‚Äù shafting us on tips because hey at least HE was making money. I had an elderly couple walk out without paying a bill once. He found out and called me a liar, and idiot, threatened my job... all over two hamburgers and a cup of tea. His wife would come in to eat with his daughter and MIL, order 3-4 entrees, sides, salads, drinks, and not tip at least once a week. 

I work for a corporation that runs the concessions of my cities convention center. It‚Äôs the most dehumanizing environment I‚Äôve ever experienced. Everything has to be done in one specific way, even if it makes our lives harder. Cashiers stand on a bare concrete floor for five straight hours. Customers ask us every shift why they don‚Äôt let us sit in chairs, what‚Äôs the point of having us stand around? Upper management fired a woman for being late twice. She has six kids and was a dedicated hard worker. They verbally abuse all the shift leads, sometimes bringing them to tears. There is no communication between upper management branches, but it is our fault if we follow the ‚Äúwrong orders‚Äù that were given to us by upper management. There is always something we are doing wrong, always. I have never felt less like a human that when I am working there.

bdbui7,"A thought exercise: video games are popular because they present an idealized version of work (seriously, hear me out)","So, a few days ago someone posted one of those **""what would you do if you didn't have to work""** threads. Many people said art, volunteer work, part time work etc. But the most repetitive answer was **video games**.
Why do people like games so much? Think about all this effort they put into them, without it improving their status IRL in any way. 

***

A few days ago, a colleague of mine has left the company. There were rumors that he's under performance review (which is corporate code for ""you're probably getting fired soon""). Let's call him Jack. 

Jack, a great guy, has been working at Hooli, a major IT company, for about 5 years, and had the reputation of someone who isn't exactly a hard worker; he enjoyed performing simpler tasks - ones that teammates described as ""press a single button to fix something"".

Jack and I often talked about video games. I've been playing the same massively-multiplayer game for ~12 years, on and off, and so did he.  The day before he resigned, he told me of a new game he's into, which involved a lot of manual tasks:

&gt; ""You have to craft your arrows and fletch them on your own, one by one, for example, in order to fill your quiver and go hunting"". 

This was interesting, coming from someone who wasn't considered the most studious staff in the company. Us engineers are always encouraged to automate everything, because manual tasks are considered uninteresting, prone to human error and inefficient. Furthermore, crafting your own arrows this way sounds like a lot of work. It made me wonder, why would people enjoy that level of detail in a game? And it got me thinking.

I would posit that... &lt;drumroll&gt;

**Video games are actually an idealized version of what we want work to be like. We play video games because they fill the hole that modern labor created.** This is, of course, a make-belief system and I'm not saying video games are 'productive' - but they're designed to make you feel like they are, whereas 9-5 office roles do not.

The following arguments to support my claim:

1. **Better reward systems**. No person character is underpaid in video games. If the quest doesn't give you enough gold, armor, reputation or the mere sense of satisfaction that you progress in the story etc, you dump it. You might even ditch the game altogether, for a more-rewarding one. 
There's no harm in changing games, you won't lose the roof over your head. Reading the WoW subreddit after realizing this has been an eye-opener: all the rants there about the current reward system can be read from a Marxist-like POV.

2. **No faceless corporations** - the quest giver is a person you interact with directly, not a huge bureaucratic machine that views you as a cog. It's strange to think about it, but in a good, immersive game - even an NPC has more heart than the IT giant that pays my salary. The quest giver, or their faction, have a story you can relate to. 

3. **No meaningless, pointless tasks** - If you get told to kill 12 wolves for their pelts, then that pelt is later used to craft armor for your character or whatnot. If you get told to pick 8 herbs, it's because they'd be used to brew a potion to heal an orc's sick daughter or something. You actually feel like you help someone! No huge Excel spreadsheets. No mass distribution emails everyone ignores anyway. No Powerpoint presentations that don't interest anyone. Heck, most raid guilds don't hold ""team meetings"" over video-conferencing. 

4. **Your game-work has actual results** - if you kill an evil demon boss, they die and you saved a village. If you gather 20 pieces of silk and nylon threads, you craft a cloak that your character can wear. The difference is visible. Who knows what the hell the paperwork I generate is for, other than checking a box for the sake of saying we did it. This relates to what Marx described as alienation from your work too, perhaps. In games, if you work hard towards something, you produce a meaningful item of some kind. You can often look back at something you achieved in the game with pride.

5. **You‚Äôre free to walk away whenever you want to**. You're a mercenary, in most cases. You can pause and continue later if you're tired, fed up or have something else to do. You can play solo or in a group. You are your own master and don't need to ask for approval to log off. I have to create 2x calendar events, fill out a web form to HR and send a mass-distribution email to the entire team whenever I take sick leave.  

6. **You get out and see the world**. This too is ironic, because in reality you sit on a chair for hours. But the ingame system sends you across different scenic fantasy lands. The only forests I get to see are in imaginary troll territories, the only snowy hills surround virtual gnome villages. Most workplaces are rows of gray open-space desks, in busy urban areas, with shops and tall office buildings. Some games take place in urban environments too, but they launch new maps so you won't get bored. My game launches new maps with new regions every few months, or overhauls the existing ones dramatically, so the world won't get repetitive.

To summarize:

I don't think people are inherently lazy. They just want to do tasks that are rewarding, interesting and serve some purpose; which is often very different than what office jobs are like. It's just said that society had to create those fake, make-believe jobs for us, as if being a rogue or a paladin 7pm-11pm makes up for being a bank analyst 9am-5pm.

The irony is if the average person were to somehow get enough money that they'll never have to work again, they wouldn't  know what to do with themselves. They're just used to being a cog in a wheel.

Hiring a vendor to solve a problem we don't even have because the owner of the company is a friend of a friend of the VP.

Lying to the public.

bbz9ns,"We are constantly exploited to sell our labor for less than its worth because the rich believe in a false meritocracy in which everyone should be a copy of their most idealized self. They are desperate as we are. Us with money, them with validation. All of us suffering physically and spiritually.","Just want to rant out my feelings.

I understand the need for idealism and that ‚Äúpuritan work ethic‚Äù but damn... its getting bad. Real bad out there. The rich and their systems want to convince us that they want to cull the herd and wipe out all weakness, but that is just an illusion. The real goal? Think. Whats the worst possible goal of this system? I tell you, the worst possible goal is that there is NO GOAL. Just plain tit-sucking immediate pleasure. The eternal throb of how to alleviate the pain of living. Thats it. No goal and no direction, just a mindless machine of a projector shooting out movies of a perfect world. All that will be left are the mindless mumblings of a rich guy recorded on some diamond encrusted USB drive, talking about ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are doing this together :)‚Äù bullshit, when really he was paying armies of lobbyists to rig the game so that he can fight the endless battle against the ‚Äúhungry masses‚Äù so that he can keep sucking the tit and nobody else can. Its not even greed at this point, just plain fucking ‚ÄúI dont want things to change‚Äù bs. Baby wants the silver bottle.

The thing I want to emphasize is that we shouldn‚Äôt make this about us/them. Even if they are evil (they fucked the planet and all of its natural resources), that anger will hold us back. The only validation left for despots and evil fucks is our anger. Dont give it to them.

bar12p,I'm tired of people being fed nonsense about college and the role that it has on their lives,"Society harasses people into going to college and honestly I'm sick of it.  High school students always hear this nonsense from their ""guidance"" counselors and parents about how they need to go to college after they graduate.  They just promote it like it's the end-all to all the troubles in life.  These kids are being fed BS.  When I was a freshman in high school, instead of being mislead for 4 years by the assumption that I needed to go to college right away, I much rather would have had someone telling me to take a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do with myself. 


As someone who has spent the past 5 and a half regretful years in college, the best advice that I can give to anyone younger than me is to take a year off after high school and to do some serious introspection.  Figure out who you really are, what you want your life to look like, what you're good at, and what going to college really means. Don't let society, your friends, or even your parents harass or guilt trip you into going to college.  What nobody tells you is the following:


**1.) Nobody is going to be helping to pay off your student loans.  And thanks to predatory practices, you'll be paying them off until you die.**




**2.) Nobody tells you about how more than half of your college experience is a repeat of high school courses that you don't need.**




**3.) Nobody tells you how it physically, mentally, and emotionally feels to be a holder of debt.**




**4.) Nobody tells you how even after wasting your mind, body, and soul on a degree, that you're not entitled to any job opportunities or a sustainable living.**




I cannot stress enough, if you have a skill that will allow you to operate outside the norms of this system, please find it and hone it.  This isn't a post telling people not to go to college, this is a post telling people not to let society guide that decision for them without considering their options first.  There's too many people who think they need degrees when all they really need is their individuality and creativity.  You don't need a degree to highlight pre-existing talents, you just need to find them.

I genuinely believe my will to live will run out before I ever get there. Not that I'm saying anything that hasn't been said here before but I can't understand how it is acceptable for society to function like this. I cannot continue to work 8-10 hours a days, 5 days a week for the next 40 to 50 years. The thought of doing so almost causes a total mental collapse. I'm not exaggerating when I say mental collapse, I'm a grown adult and some days I'm nearly reduced to a puddle of anhedonic flesh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Working literally makes me want to kill myself. Like half the people here say, it's not my job in particular. Hell if anything my job is kind of easy. It's a desk job, pays pretty well, semi-flexible hours.  But at every job I've had everyday is a tortuous struggle. I can usually come in and get work done for 4 or 5 hours but at the point my reasonably healthy human brain just can't continue to do repetitive mental labor. I can't focus and then my mind starts to wonder. All of a sudden I feel like a monkey in a cage. I try to surf the internet for something to take my mind off my boredom but nothing helps, I've been doing this at every job for nearly a decade now so there's no effective distractions left. Then you just sit there and think about all the things you want to do with your life that you'll never get the chance to because they don't generate profit and are therefore completely worthless. I just want to go home, plant a garden, go for a walk, write more music, get involved in my community. I would do anything for a sabbatical. Just like 6 months and some free healthcare to get healthy and clear my mind but that is unacceptable in America. Say what you will but this world is completely fucked.

b6lf16,Does anyone struggle with the 9-5/lateness?,"...Honestly it's ruined my life. And even typing it I feel like a fucking disgusting lowlife and a child. 

In the last year, this was so distinct a problem I got a fucking hernia repair surgery mistakenly thinking it would help just get through the morning routine - wake up, drink caffeine, take a dump, pee a million times (sorry for TMI) - and it made things worse. It destroyed already bad stamina. 

That single thing - just, like, being able to pee in my own apartment and not put myself in a situation where I am trapped on a subway needing to pee like a racehorse (or something else), and that downward pull of desperate, sand-in-eyes, muscle-creaking fatigue, day in day out, in failing to conform to this, the fundamental part of the social contract for an employee- has ruined my life. 

I'm three months post op and I sit in horror and disbelief with a fucking block of wood (sutures) in my guts, an internal cavity that feels as large as the inside of a grapefruit (so much for breathing normally - I wake up groggy, in pain, and semi-suffocating), amazed I have made another horrible, *horrible* life decision - like a fucking body-destroying decision, making things I struggled with *so much worse* -  for one reason, and one reason only - the lifelong failure to be a morning person. (I'm sorry to be gross, but - welp, it's the truth.)

I set my alarm clock for...6:35. Might only be conscious at 7. Drink coffee. Shovel food in. Floss, while lying down, trying to enjoy the middle ground when I can still do my routine without standing. 

I know how long it takes to jog to the each subway station.

But those one or two activities - basically trying to avoid a situation where I find myself needing to pee like a racehorse on a subway (or worse) and covering acne/squeezing my meat husk into work clothes and shoes - they take up the most time. That and plain fatigue. 

I *GOT A FUCKING ELECTIVE SURGERY* under the stupid idea it might help - I was dumb, and wrong, and now...fuck me, it is so much worse than i could have imagined. (That's another story though. Suffice it to say I have gotten dumb with age. It's easy when you are a miserable zombie and no choices you make actually seem positive.) 

And the longer I am in a job - the more horrible it is. The more fucking impossible it seems to make 9am. (Not 9:05; God forbid, 9:10. 9:10 unless someone is dying gets fired.) 

Ideally in your desk, computer on, by...8:58. 

Can't do it. Amazed I was ever able to make 8:30am in the morning for  high school. It's enough to make me understand women that sit on the subway putting on mascara, risking poking their own eyeballs out. 

 Because with each day of 9-10 hour days in a shitty office chair or in pain, it's so easy. It's so easy to fuck up and be late and physically be unable to get up and stay up, when you wake up in the morning with lower back pain, shoulder pain, and simply not wanting to get out of bed. Head throbbing, feet throbbing, lower back throbbing, limbs falling asleep. I find myself sitting out of breath and wanting to stretch out in bed again, the last stretch before I stuff myself into clothes. 

Sometimes, I'll admit it, I curl up back in a ball under the blankets putting on my bra and find myself browsing the internet again, because that's my hobby - lying down, and surfing the internet. This is when I have five to ten minutes of wiggle room - so I think. I squander them. I think to myself, I am so tired, I am so lonely - I panic, looking for *one last enjoyable thing to do*, and then I have to hustle and end up late anyway. I make it a gamble instead of something I can do at my leisure.

I fall asleep at 1am, it takes 2.5 to really *wake up*, for the caffeine to pass through. In hindsight....I dunno, how the fuck can someone have an adult life having to bomb themselves to sleep every night? 

What drugs might one take to get to sleep at 10-11pm?  

In my last contract job my boss barely tolerated me coming in at 10:15 and staying till 6:30 but fuck if I don't miss it horribly because she permitted it. I will never fucking have that again. It was in a big company and I could just sit quietly and listen to podcasts. I was left alone. It was still humiliating and awful and I know it makes me a bad, lazy person. That's how it's treated. I know the whole adult world...fuck it, has to endure 8am, 8:30am start times, from horrible commutes. 

I just can't imagine it. How is this normal? 

And then, having to endure that till 5 or 6, even if you don't take lunch...fuck me. What time is there for oneself, if you have to go to bed at 10-11? 

I have another temp job, starting at 9am. 

I am just...horrified and miserable. 

Fuck me, that I don't have the skills to work a 10am-6 schedule. I put myself on a path of being so low value - a serial temp - and the singular virtue expected of me is being on time. 

I can't imagine saying this anywhere but here - I've struggled with this my entire life, with morning stamina, and all those little unpredictables -the last bathroom trip you tell yourself must only last 30 seconds, the elevator, realizing you have misplaced your phone somehow in the last five minutes, a held up subway, pedestrian (or for you vehicular commuters) traffic, the wait for a train - they ruin a life. Two minutes. Five minutes. Seven minutes. Minute to minute. They get you fired. Those I know that however long it says it takes in Google, you need, *at a minimum, another 15 minutes.* 

And still, even when I *feel* like I hurry, even when I can time each part of my routine - it's those moments I stop, put my head in hands, exhausted, wait for my blood pressure to rise again - I have failed to do that. I have rarely ever been early for anything in my entire life and I realize now if I plan to be 10 minutes early, I need a fucking half hour jump, at least. 
 

...It should be easy, and it isn't, and it is not an understatement to say that failure - ultimately a failure of physical weakness, above all else - has destroyed me. It has gotten me fired from at least three jobs. It means I am a fucking shitheel to my employers, no matter what work I do. It means I am not an adult - I'm an asshole.

I can't protest otherwise. Even employers that tolerated it - in my experience, what I was telling people is, don't trust me. Don't value me. Don't train me like you want to keep me. I am expendable - treat me that way. 

I knew this and still - setting the clock an hour earlier, making sure to drink coffee earlier (sadly drinking caffeine does not replace sleep at some point) - it did. not. work. 

I failed. I failed myself. It's so stupid stupid and pathetic but doing this one thing, the requirement of all jobs - especially jobs for losers like m - is...have your ass in a chair at 8:45AM, no matter where you live. 

If any of you relate, esp. those of you taking public transit, I'm listening. Because there is *no vice worse than lateness*. And fuck, I get it on a personal level. I'm a basket case. I hate being kept late. I hate the uncertainty of waiting for someone. And I hate the sense I waste others' time. It's a perpetual of cycle of guilt, terror and humiliation. 

But at work - there is no worse vice. And I've worked in offices with crazy people who could still make 8:30AM. 

90% of office jobs can be done from home and I think that's what makes this so much worse. There's no one I envy more than the remote employee.

b6c5f1,Thoughts on Laziness,"It seems that most people think of laziness as a quality to be ashamed of, but I actually admire laziness quite a bit. ¬†Here are my thoughts on the topic:

Laziness is fundamentally a person fully understanding and realizing their own desires, independent of how others attempt to shape or manipulate those desires (consciously or otherwise). ¬†The lazy person gives priority to their own satisfaction, rather than the satisfaction of others ‚Äì especially since the other's satisfaction is often only an illusion of satisfaction that forms around what is really just the realization of mutual suffering. ¬†When you realize that your work doesn't actually make other people happy in any positive sense; that it only staves off disappointment or resentment in a negative sense; and that it is rooted in a joyless network of social exchanges in which anything that resembles generosity or freedom is appropriated and transmuted into something ugly and soulless: this is when laziness starts to kick in.

A lazy person constantly attempts to grasp the moment, rather than endlessly deferring the moment for a future that never actually arrives. ¬†This is what work is, essentially: the positing of the present moment as a means to future ends. This is fine, except that we have let work stop being a means to an end. ¬†These future ends ultimately exceed what is strictly necessary for life or well-being. The purpose of work becomes not the means to the end of subjectivity, but an endlessly recurring objectification of one's own life. ¬†That first step of thinking of the future product of the labor of the present disconnects us from an immanent experience of life, an immanent connection with our very being, and turns us into a tool that exists *for* a life that never gets lived. ¬†This is how civilizations fall into the trap of luxury; even after work fulfills the basic needs of life, we continue to work as if the essential way to experience life is through its objectification, through the endless production of objects that actually objectify *us* rather than satisfy us. ¬†Laziness often comes with the realization that one's needs are in reality quite simple, and that the rewards of luxury are, at least to some degree, an illusion. ¬†At a certain point luxury is no longer a means of present satisfaction, a means of *play*, but instead becomes a horizon that can never be reached, an end that requires the constant sacrifice of the moment. 

In some sense, the people who are the *best* at being lazy are the people who always see things in terms of the *ultimate* end, which is always *death*. ¬†These people recognize the absurdity of meaning when that meaning is confronted by the truth (the non-meaning) of our mortality. ¬†It is possible for us to grasp our own mortality and to *live*, moment to moment, in recognition of this truth. ¬†This recognition leads us to reject the ultimate principles that people try to substitute for death. ¬†All other principles, i.e. the principles which others pretend will anchor all of life's meaning, are in fact illusory. ¬†They are myths that developed in order to subjugate people to a utility which itself is ultimately *arbitrary*. ¬†When you die, it isn't going to matter that you worked hard and acquired property; nor is it going to matter that your life was *wasted* on laziness. ¬†Death is an end to all such meanings, and this fact itself gives us a meaning of life as something of *immediate* value. ¬†Life is best lived in constant confrontation with death, because death is what reveals life's true immediacy to us! ¬†And it is in this immediacy that we find dissatisfaction with work.

Laziness can also be courageous, because it requires constant confrontation with feelings of guilt and shame that are imposed upon you. ¬†It requires a profound *commitment* if one is to be happy with their laziness, and not get bogged down in anguish and regret. ¬†Everything in our society is structured in such a way that nothing can be freely offered or accepted, and everything must be *exchanged*. ¬†There is no real way to opt-out of this massive system of social exchange, as even one's refusal to participate wholeheartedly is interpreted as an offering and returned to you as spite, resentment, disappointment, pity, even jealousy. ¬†When people notice that you are trying to act freely and independently, they immediately saddle you with all of their psychosocial baggage. Even if this is not the case, our very sense of *being* is rooted in this system from the moment we are born, and we can easily begin to chastise *ourselves* for our laziness. ¬†It takes an admirable amount of courage, determination, self-confidence and presence of mind to truly be lazy without also feeling like shit (something I have yet to figure out, on my end ‚Äì but I certainly aspire to it!).

Finally, laziness is not selfish, but actually opens up the possibility for the only genuine form of generosity. ¬†When a lazy person *does* truly choose to act, without duress or manipulation, it is an action that can only be *freely given* to another, a sacrifice made with *full consciousness* of what is actually being sacrificed ‚Äì the preciousness of the moment. ¬†And in that chosen act, there is always an invitation to *share* that moment; not exchange it for some other form of social or cultural capital, not defer it for some future product, but to share it *immanently* and without any expectation of *return*. ¬†And the most admirable lazy person, when they do happen to have other forms of capital at their disposal, they tend to *waste it*, generously and gloriously. ¬†They do not exchange it for recognition, they do not hoard it for the sake of future utility, but instead they expend it with the sole purpose of forming *moments* of joy and play that can be *immanently shared*.

Bottom-line: don't be ashamed of your laziness. ¬†Be proud, be free, find what matters to you, be generous and *grasp the moment*! ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/b6c5f1/thoughts_on_laziness/,1553733202.0,99,1.0,12,antiwork,DrinkyDrank
b68rnb,Anti-Work ideology and the military?,"Because my parents managed to do it when rent was 300 dollars in the 90‚Äôs, my parents think that at the elderly age of 20, I should be able to be on my own by now, so when they move in May, they won‚Äôt let me come with.

2. In the process, stop for a short while, to spawn little replicas of yourself, so the world would have enough consumers - to maintain the presumably-infinite environmentally-destructive cycle of 'economic growth'. 

3. Maybe you get to live a little after that, if your health situation still allows you to. 

4. Die.

We are all suffering to keep a system alive which is infact killing us and those around us. Yet we think we need to keep doing it so we won't stand out too much, or in fear of what people might say. Yet those other people deep down hold the same values, they dislike their job too, but just keep it together enough to not show it or commit suicide.

Where has all the beauty of the world gone? I know it's still here, but we don't see it enough in our lives. Be got tricked very badly. My mother has been working for 36 years and she admited there weren't many days that she was happy at work (she just needs to last another 4 years now), what kind of life is that? So you are all that discomfort of holding a job and keeping it together, for what, for who? For a home that isn't even yours, for a car you can't afford?

b3ih9b,Just gave my boss my resignation notice.,"It feels like the end of an era for me, and I‚Äôm considering this post the final chapter in my personal r/antiwork trilogy. 

The first chapter, posted a couple months ago, saw me venting and breaking down the pay cut that my position had received at the beginning of the year.  Corporate had decided that my position was worth $8500-$9000 less than what they were previously paying me annually...  this was truly the inciting incident - Frodo cursed with bearing the One Ring to Rivendell with the wraiths in pursuit.

The second chapter, posted a couple days ago, was a meme that I created with the purpose to send to my boss... a snarky reply to the corporate demands that we work mandatory Saturdays back-to-back to make up for their ‚Äúlost revenue‚Äù.  This was merely the latest brutal reminder that I was nothing but a cog in a cold uncaring machine.  My branch manager and I might have been on good, personable terms...but higher up the corporate tower was the all-seeing eye of Sauron...pure evil incarnate (*cough* capitalism).  The meme was my resistance, and it was followed up by a real life conversation between my branch manager and I.  I was able to tell him exactly how I felt - something I know not very many workers ever get the luxury of doing with their supervisors/bosses without fear of punishment.  Nothing else was really achieved except that I was ‚Äúoff the hook‚Äù for one of the mandated Saturdays this month as long as I was a team player this Saturday.

Which brings us to the final chapter. Today I got off the phone with my manager after letting him know that April 30th will be my last day.  I wish I could have had the conversation in person, but I left early for my route today well before he was even there and wouldn‚Äôt get back in time before he left.  But I finally did it.  After months of inner struggle, of shaky promises of a ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù and a massive pay cut, I finally did what I said to myself I would do for a long time - Within the fiery pits of Mount Doom, Frodo cast the One Ring from whence it came.  

I‚Äôm quitting and pursuing my teaching credentials.  Once I become a teacher, I will look into joining the teachers union, one of the last examples of where unionization is still going strong.  I plan to dedicate the rest of my working life to lifting up my fellow workers and raising class consciousness.

b1n7nu,Tired of this macho man bullshit,"So fucking tired of it and it‚Äôs breaking me. I started my life working as a power line man. Through my apprenticeship guys would scream and yell and treat apprentices like shit. They were bad teachers and couldn‚Äôt handle it so they overcompensated with screaming. After I became a journeyman they would give me a hard time because I wouldn‚Äôt do the same to apprentices. I finally quit that job after they raised prices for farmers laid off all out of scope employees and then had the balls to boast of over 2 billion profit in a recession.

Now I work in the oilfield by myself in a service truck. They days are long hard and monotonous. Driving me insane. But low and behold every time I work on a site with another crew they have to act like big dick swingers and pretend to be tough. Like fuck off I just want to do my job and leave.

b1aqt7,"6 figure salary, 3x free meals a day, massage chairs and other benefits. I'm still extremely unhappy","I'm an engineer, and I work for a major IT company you all heard of. You use our products every day. Possibly even right now, as you read this post. They're famous for offering very, very generous benefits to their staff. I worked hard to get here, thinking it'd make my life better. I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone around me seem brainwashed to absolutely love it. It feels like I joined a cult. They're super proud to having passed the company's rigorous interview process, they're happy to travel the world to visit other offices, they're absolutely delighted to recite the company's values on every coffee break etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**I fucking hate it. Every moment.**

&amp;#x200B;

**But what hurts most is having to pretend and put on a smiley-face for 40 hours a week.**

&amp;#x200B;

I still find it excruciating to get out of bed every morning. I'm tired and depressed just from the thought of having to do my meaningless, bureaucratic, irrational duties, which relate to a product that brings no real benefit to the world. All this, for an evil corporation, that encourage us to consume more and more, by shoving ads in our faces - ads which tell us we're not good enough, unless we purchase &lt;insert product name&gt;.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a huge work load, not at all - on the contrary. But the silly bullshit tasks I get to do take me forever, because I'm so unmotivated and tired all the time. I procrastinate indefinitely. I get to my desk in the morning, and just space out. I space out during the infinite amount of meetings we have (somewhere between 2-5 meetings a day. No kidding). I replay entire movies in my head during team meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

I think quite a few of my coworkers aren't doing anything of significance at work either. They do, however, manufacture an infinite stream of emails, IMs and internal documentation of what they do - meeting summaries, reports, design documents etc. I spoke to a colleague the other day about ""[Bullshit Jobs](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs)"" by David Graeber. That was the first time that a coworker dared to break the code of silence and admit to me: ""if I don't come to the office tomorrow, the next day and the year after that, nothing would happen and nobody would be affected"".

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 36 now, which means I've another 30 years of this bullshit ahead of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there's such thing as a job that would make me happy. At this point, **I just want to be left alone**, to listen to audiobooks, make art, read fanfic and play online games with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone left a positive comment on something I wrote online recently, and as soon as I read their compliments (while still at the office) - the fatigue of work disappeared altogether. It was so weird to suddenly realize that tiredness is not physiological at all. I produced something under my hands, and someone else enjoyed it! I had a tiny impact on this world!

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't that what work is supposed to be about? What are we wasting our lives for in offices exactly? It's unclear to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of quitting and finding a part-time job, to reduce the amount of soul-crushing hours I burn under the fluorescent lights of an office. Alternatively, I saved up enough money to take some time off work and live frugally on my savings for at least 8-12 months. Both of these options are financially dangerous ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Just had to vent, I guess. I don't think there's a way out.

b0wxhw,Suddenly I find myself on the other side the unemployment thirst,"I too was once highly desperate for any work and now I have a job. I  don't agree with the company's (neoliberal) values of entrepreneurship  and stuff, but at least its an income in this viciously capitalist  society.

Now I am not even regularized yet and my boss has  delegated to me the hiring of more project based workers. The emails and  applications coming in are eerily familiar, a mirror to when I too was  an overqualified applicant rushing in to any job opening I can find.  While unemployed multiple times after graduation, I notice some tricks  and traps that immediately screen out a bulk of applications; little  things like not attaching sample works or wrong email subject.

Suddenly  from a paradoxical position of power ‚Äî being not-yet-regularized and  yet accepting job applications myself ‚Äî and seeing my past unemployed  self in these desperate applicants, I'll overlook little mistakes  because that could be me too. But it still makes me sad. These people  are overqualified. One applicant said such BS that she ""dreams"" to be  part of this part-time job. I've been there making that BS fam. I cannot  blame you for writing this, and I wish I'd take you all, but I can't.  We're all competing for scraps the capitalist system taunts us with.

I  see the desperation in-between the lines and that was me once ‚Äî and  probably still is, since I am not regularized. I have no illusions; this  open call could be the auditions for the position I am sitting right  now. But on some level, I don't care. I don't want to compete with these  people to keep my position. I just want a decent life. And I am sure  that is these applicants was as well. Capitalism atomizes us, turning  use each into readily replaceable gears.

I don't want to be a gear. I don't want these people to be gears. There is no happy ending to this post.

azaga6,How to survive working when you hate work,"I thought I was alone in this world hating the concept of work, but this sub has helped me realize it actually is a stupid system and I'm not just a lazy piece of shit...

For that I want to thank you, and as such I want to give back some advice that has helped me cope with the 'sell your time to live' BS over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **DO NOT GIVE A FUCK**

The most important rule of them all. You may be tempted to take pride in your work or Go Above and Beyond**‚Ñ¢** as they all encourage you to. DON'T.

They don't pay you enough to deserve your best. You go to work and you give the least effort you can without getting fired. Like that preggo teen who's always on her phone, hasn't shown up for work half the time and is still somehow employed. Be better than her and show up for the pay at least, but don't give them any more than needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Smile and nod**

This one saved my ass plenty of times. Annoying coworker who wont shut up? Smile and nod, move on. Boss wants you to work faster? Okay. Smile and nod and keep the same pace. Customer is bitching at you? Smile. And. Nod.

Fake it, who cares, you're paid by the hour and as long as you're not getting disciplined you're golden. Let them think you're an absolute moron even if you're the smartest ass around. The lower their expectations of you are the less effort you have to put in.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Don't go for the promotion**

If somehow you still did well enough by sticking around long enough to be offered a promotion, DON'T TAKE IT.

The higher you move up, the more shit you get. It's hard to believe, especially closer to the bottom - but trust me, the higher money number is not worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Test the waters**

How much shit can you get away with? Only one way to find out!

If you haven't been coached yet, you're doing too much work. Most places will give you a warning for performance before ditching you, so tread the line and see how much you can get away with. Then keep pushing the line. This way I ended up taking 3x as many breaks as I was supposed to at one job and *still* left as a 'definite rehire'.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Know what you're worth and exaggerate**

Bad shit happens and you're back on the market for a job? No problem. Put on your confident face, brush up your resume and fill in employment gaps by expanding jobs you had before. Few will call references, it's all a fucking dance and all you gotta do is get an interview somehow. Once you're in just pretend you're gonna be that person that always Goes Above and Beyond**‚Ñ¢**, and you likely got the job. When you do, move on to step 1.

&amp;#x200B;

aybr3l,I applied for a telecom job,"It was done via a recruitment office. 

The recruiter called 1 day later

Hi, do I call at a good time?
( I was just exiting the bus and was able to go to a quiet spot)

‚ÄúYes, sure go ahead!‚Äù

She asked some questions.

Why do you want to work at mobile operator X?

‚ÄúI like the challenge this and that‚Äù

Why do you prefer operator X above Y and Z?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, this job was available‚Äù

I am sorry I won‚Äôt be able to pass you through to the next step in recruitment, we want people that have a lot of interest in Mobile operator X.

She gave a tip, that I should do more research next time.

Call lasted 2 minutes.

Why do I need to have a genuine interest in a telecom operator? They all provide the same services, but only at different price points.

I had another job offer for another internet provider, the guy called later that day, but I didn‚Äôt pick up. I will do some fucking research and call him today and play the game, making myself a good slave for the internet provider with a ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù interest in the company.

awwbxt,I just have to rant and get this out of me,"I'm not planning on making a whole lot of sense.

I hate my job. I hate my career. I just want to get up and walk out most days, but I can't. I have to pay bills, I have to pay the rent, I have to do all sort of shit. I'm just sick of it.

I work as an engineer at a small company and lately they've been pressuring me to work more, making snide comments about ""work ethic"" when I get up and leave at 5, talk about ""things that need to get done sometimes require you work late"". I'm sick of it. I'm fucking sick of it. Sorry, but I have a clear line in the fucking sand. This is just what I do to pay the bills, fuck off.

And I don't even care about the work. I have 0 fucking interest in it. I never cared about engineering. Never, not once. The only way I got through college was constantly being drunk and high. It was a fucking miserable experience and it only get worse. Why would anyone want to do this?

And now. And NOW I have to get my PE license. They won't stop pestering me about it. I don't fucking want a PE license, I don't even want to be doing any of this. More responsibility? More Work? Are you fucking kidding me? Take that shit and shove it.

The week before Last we had a project that literally had only been worked on for a few days and was suddenly due 100% on that Friday and on that Monday my boss say me down in her office for a little chat ""Sometimes, being an engineer means working more than 40 hours."" Fucking why? I don't make these deadlines. Why is it more than 40 hours a week? 40 hours is already too much. You think I give a fuck about making these deadlines? I worked nearly 60 hours that week. By the time I left on Friday I couldn't even see straight. 

And just last week I came home sick because I got a passive aggressive e-mail about accurately tracking my time down to 10 minute intervals. Are you fucking kidding me? FUCK OFF. Why did I get that e-mail? Because I mentioned to the secretary that I was going to have to start leaving work 15 minutes early so that I could get to my class that I have to take to prep for the PE exam. You know what she said ""You still have to work 40 hours."" I don't fucking care about the time. I'm not sitting here writing down what I'm doing every fucking 10 minutes. I'm sorry, I'm not. Fuck that.

The only good thing about this career, this industry, whatever, is the pay. That's it. That's all. There is nothing intrinsically satisfying about it. There's nothing interesting. There's nothing fun. FUCK ENGINEERING

Jesus Christ. I am just so fucking pissed. I am so fucking tired. I've been working since I was 16. I always ALWAYS keep doing what people keep telling me to do and I don't even fucking get why. I'm miserable all the god damn time. I'm tired all the god damn time. I'm not even depressed, I'm just fucking mad. 

The world needs to change. Like now. fucking NOW. Fuck being lectured. Stop it with your stupid work ethic tropes. FUCK

she‚Äôs brainwashed so she heard absolutely nothing i said and she finally said ‚Äúwhat a waste of a life‚Äù which really upset me. how can you tell someone who else that their life was wasted? we determine whether our lives were wasted or unfulfilling because we are the ones who live them every day.

Work is x10 harder because one feels like shit all day, aching joints, bloated stomach and cramps, feeling like you're seeing the world from the back of your mind. I'd say if work didn't start so ridiculously early and flexitime was introduced people would at least feel a lot more rested. Getting the chance to sleep in makes me feel like I've recovered from a storm. And get this, quoted from business insider.

3. The a.m. time stamp is a little iffy. Even if you're more of a night owl, keep those habits to yourself and try not to send off an email at 1 a.m. It might make people wonder what you're doing up in the middle of the night. 

I got a work email at 11.10 pm which greatly annoyed me so I went searching for how common it is. Anyway, while I think employers should keep emails within business hours and not doing so just shows how they don't have their shit together or any manners, I really hate the tone of this quote. It's like if you're a late night person you're not normal, but if normal means following the Protestant o'clock time schedule (with its associations of the straight and narrow, Puritanical and regimental) who would want to be?

They're happy to list off all the requirements of the role, in other words, what they expect from you, but god forbid they tell you what you should expect from them.

Employers; work is a two-way agreement. Employees provide a service to you in exchange for money. Why the hell would you think it's OK to not inform people how much money they'll receive if they apply and are successful? Do you think people are applying because the job sounds fun?

Either the pay is good and you therefore have no reason to hide it, or you're wilfully hiding it because it's terrible and you think it will deter people from applying. And if it's the latter, people are going to find out anyway, so all you're doing is wasting the time of people who apply.

Or perhaps you're withholding it because you think people should want to apply based on the job role alone, and that ""money shouldn't matter"". In that case, why not drop the salary to zero? See how well that works out for you.

9hef1d,[Serious] How do you do it?,"I'm talking about the constant grinding, sleeping little hours, making ends just barely meet, etc. I'm 22, with no work experience and studying a career I love, but I know the rest of my life will be spent working for others that I don't care about nor care about me, in some badly paid position (if I even get a job in the field I like) or something else that I didn't study for and pays the bare minimum. This doesn't bring any happiness and there is no gold pot on the other side. I'm carrying on for the ones I love, for the experiences I want to have (loving relationships, good friends, travelling, learning things, etc.) but it all seems to be impossible once the real grinding starts.

I'm curious: how do people manage to work 8-12 hours a day just to get by, plus manage their lives? I'm just studying and I'm exhausted, can't do anything after Uni which is only 4 hours per day; this makes me very nervous. Also I'm anxious about the new work ethic you're required to have, not only you have to work a certain time, but you're expected to like it, to help the company/State, to be the best employee and to constantly compete with your peers. I can't handle it now where I see myself competing with everyone else in my classes...

When I was a Junior in High School, my Economics teacher told our class something I will never forget. Since I was only 16 at the time what he said kind of went over my head, but now that I'm a bit older, his words really resonate with me. 


He said something along the lines of,

""When I was in the military and stationed in Europe, I met a gentleman and had a conversation with him. I asked him 'What do you do?', and he told me 'I enjoy skiing, going fishing, and going on jogs'.

 I was puzzled, So then I told him, 

'Oh no no, I meant where do you work?', he told me he worked at a bank, but then he also told me 'Why does it matter where I work? When you ask somebody what they do, they should tell you what they enjoy doing in life, what they're passionate about.' And that really got me thinking about our own society and whether we focus on work too much.""

If you're good at something, there's a very good chance that you put a lot of work, time and effort into refining that skill. If you're spending that much time learning something, you've got to have some interest in it.

ly8n1v,UBI and Assured Housing will just lead to serfdom if we aren't careful,"I know a lot of people on this sub really like the idea of UBI and assured housing to remove the violence of capitalist society.  However, when thinking of this, it's even more important to use logic to get through this situation.

**Why would your torturer put down the lash if not to pick up a worse tool to hurt you with?**

Serfdom was actually a pretty good deal for it's time.  'Free' land to till, your lord's armies and walls would protect your family from bandits, and your lord would even throw you parties out of appreciation (yup, pizza parties are that old).  Did I mention they worked an average of 3 days a week?

Thing is, this was back when the elites of society were basically dying from the same things we were and not even living that much more comfortably than peasants. Plus there wasn't that much of a technological gap between swords and ploughshares.

This is the best case scenario for UBI/assured housing and it doesn't have a chance of happening.  Modern elites are used to being able to extract 20x-1000x the profit for something they pay for, you can bet your ass they'll be doing that if they're 'giving you' a stipend and a place to stay.  3 Days?  How about 7, you now live at your job.

We don't even have to imagine this, there was a very good post on here that was unfortunately deleted where the person detailed being offered ""free housing"" by an employer, who then verbally abused them, forced them to build countless projects on their property, and even asked their work to scale back their hours to do more unpaid tasks for them at home.

**Yang and Musk are sus**

When an elite is talking about UBI or assured housing it should send a chill down your spine.  They do not have the same needs as you or I.  Even the most well intentioned politicians are brought up to the status of elite once they win their election.  They will never worry about being hungry, their resume will assure them some form of advisory role in some company for more than you will make in your lifetime just because of their role in society.  When they hamstring their campaign promises, when they sabotage their constituency, when the only Elites who can say anything that would actually fix our issues are too weak to do anything, that isn't them being stupid or incompetent, *it is part of the plan*.  Please don't be dense, there really is no such thing as a free lunch under capitalist society.  

**We will need some form of assured resources, housing, etc, to remove the violence from capitalism, but it must be taken from the ruling class, that power must be physically removed from the hands of the ruling class and placed in our control or we will never be sure what we are giving up in the short or long term.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ly8n1v/ubi_and_assured_housing_will_just_lead_to_serfdom/,1614938207.0,59,0.9,21,antiwork,capnbarky

lxy0qf,"""A least you have a job!"" and other responses to fill out a bingo card","I'm so fucking sick of this response. I get it all the time. I could fill out a bingo card with all the regurgitated responses I get whenever I share a complaint about my job, and ""at least you have a job!"" could be the free space. I literally hear it from my other coworkers. 

I work a back-breaking warehouse job in a red state where workers are taken advantage of at every turn. I don't mind the actual work itself (throwing cardboard boxes around), but management is shitty and, for the amount of work we have to do, so is the pay. Mandatory overtime, six days a week, and they just cut our pay back because it's no longer the holidays (even though we're shipping out just as many packages now as we were on Christmas). Quarantine is required, but unpaid, if you come into contact with someone who tests positive for COVID. This job is literally squeezing the life out of me, but heaven forbid I talk about my grievances, or else: 

""At least you have a job!""

""Why don't you just go get a different job if it's that bad?""

""At least you're not in debt!"" 

""But the insurance is good, right?""

""You should be grateful you're not unemployed!""

""Every job is like that, so just get over it."" 

""You signed up for this. Stop complaining."" 

""It's better than being homeless!""

No, I'm not grateful for this job. People on unemployment are making more money than I do. No, I'm not going to just go 'get a different job.' I would have to take a pay cut if I did and work even more hours to make up for it. No, I'm not going to get over it. This job fucking sucks. All jobs fucking suck.

Anyways, on my first day they made me watch all the bullshit training videos, and there was one about unions. In the video, the union was plotting how to manipulate the workers and lying about everything. It was about 15 minutes long and had some stupid story about a worker who ""stood up to the union and fought for her rights.""

I find it very ironic that the company made a video about not being manipulated, and they use very apparent manipulation tactics in the video, which they force every employee to watch.

There's a good chance you picked it up from some place like r/antiwork, but I really wish this tired meme would die already. 
 
Work can be exhausting, boring, exploitative, unhealthy, and a dozen other things, regardless of how many hours you're forced to give away. Your 50-hour-week doesn't make my 20-hour-week any easier. My workplace being shitty doesn't make yours lovely. Your American lack of health and care doesn't mean things are great in Europe or anywhere else.
 
Often it's the stuff that only takes minutes that leaves the deepest mental scars. 
 
So, please, can we turn down the pain olympics, just a notch? Can we acknowledge that our work situations are difficult in a variety of different ways, without constantly pointing out that things can be worse in some specifics?

lwwabp,"""The Customer is Always Right"" is fascist brainwashing.","The nature of capitalism is primarily one of a dictatorship of capital, a dictatorship of capitalists as the primary owners of capital.  In wielding capital you effectively wield dictatorial power, even as a working class person, for the small moment you exchange currency for something of value, the culture of capitalism offers you dictatorial power, the ""customer is always right"".

Why is that?  It's because it is foundational to capitalism, capital has unlimited power under capitalism.  Without the practice of allowing even the lower classes dictatorial power relative to the exchange of their currency, a vanishingly small share of capital, there would not be the dictatorial power of bosses, landlords, and banks using their greater overall capital to wield even greater dictatorial power, over employees, over tenants, over politicians and smaller capitalists.

""The customer must always be right"" because in essence, even the employee-employer relationship is a ""merchant-customer"" relationship.  Your boss is your customer, they wield dictatorial power with their capital and purchase your labor power, time out of your life, and own you for a period of time.  Even if you use the ""freedom"" to walk away from a bad job, you are still beholden to ""the customer is always right"" you will need to find a new customer, a new capitalist to survive, every time risking that this dictatorial power will be antagonistic to your livelihood.  If you offer bad service or appear rebllious, this will spread like with any ""business"" and you will risk not finding new customers, a new capitalist.  You are not owned by any one person like under a feudal system, you are owned by capital, and by extension, those who wield it.

The customer is always right because under capitalism, capital is your god and it can do whatever it wants to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lwwabp/the_customer_is_always_right_is_fascist/,1614784759.0,114,0.93,14,antiwork,capnbarky

ltb1v8,School trains us to be corrupt slaves.,"In school we are rewarded for hard work. School is long hours, then we have homework. Overall it is worse than a 9-5 job. By the time university comes you must study nearly 12 hours a day to get a decent mark and complete your assignments. This trains us to do as we are told, or else we suffer the consequences of failure which usually is to redo a class. No where in school are we taught to explore our passions, or to explore ourselves. We are told that exercise is good, but that doesn't even count towards any credits in university. You have 1 chance, if you pick the wrong subject and realize you don't enjoy it, too bad, switching costs money and now you are an adult. Trying to do anything leads to pain, but being a slave and just doing what you're told leads to money. We are studying subjects we don't like, which primes us to accept the jobs we won't like. Trying to escape in anyway to find what you truly like is painful.

Because we already don't enjoy what we are doing, the next best thing is to optimize what we like. And we all like money. Gamblers get a high every time they win, much like this we get a high when we get paid.

When you cheat in school and not get caught, you are pleasantly rewarded with a good grade. There is no reward for hard work but failing to understand. There is little reward for understanding but getting a question wrong. At university level mostly right is near 0 mark for that question. Multiple choice is just right or wrong, you get rewarded for getting the correct answer, whether through understanding, or a cheating technique. Students are being taught purely not to get caught which is corruption. True understanding of the subject is near pure torture. Students are learning more creative ways to cheat, better analysis of which person around you if any has same answer order as you. Or perhaps working together with a group of cheaters sitting in a bubble utilizing hand signals. Sometimes as simple as paying someone that looks like you to do the test.

We want ethics, but fail to make it more rewarding than corruption at the school level. Just like the general world we are in. Corruption is deep, and it's within us all. It starts as early as school. We need to find ways to eradicate corruption from ourselves, and our society. I'm sure you know of cheaters getting higher marks than you. Just seeing such practices can corrupt our hearts, even if it is a little bit. To fight it, we must identify corruption, in the system, within ourselves, within others and educate each other.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ltb1v8/school_trains_us_to_be_corrupt_slaves/,1614382889.0,76,0.98,7,antiwork,poutine_here

lsp0jm,Management sent out an email telling us we'll be working 11 hour days through April 15th and led to the most beautiful mutiny in the Teams chat.,"I am a technical support rep for a company that produces a major tax program. I honestly have no idea of the market share, but there is definitely an infinite supply of asshole CPAs who call in and expect tax advice from people who aren't even required to have a college degree. I accepted the job as a recent college grad with a worthless degree thinking I'd struck gold making $20/hr. Although I was hesitant about a call center environment, I thought surely it couldn't be so bad...they're professionals after all, right? LMAO 

The program is absolute trash, especially this year. The IRS already made things difficult with delaying the start of efiling, and people constantly call bitching about forms not being ready in our program yet but other programs have them! The developers are in their ivory tower and don't provide information so trivial as a future release date, as if they could meet a deadline anyway. The GUI looks like it's straight out of Windows 95, and almost every single call I take is something that's already been documented and ""will be fixed on a future release"". 

Because it's a tax program, our hours are already extended for tax season to help our dear CPA patrons. January through April is hell, then we get another busy season when extensions are due in September and October. Last year, it was like busy season never ended after the deadline was extended until July. They still waited until the last damn minute. 

We've been working 10 hour days most of this month, which after a lunch break is pretty much 11 hours of my day anyway. Despite this being a relatively high paying position for little required skill in my area, people keep quitting and management pretends to understand the mental health aspect, but just makes the rest of us work more. Everyone's tensions boiled over in the department-wide Teams chat at the end of my shift after management sent out an email saying the first week of March will be 10.5 hours schedule shift, then through April 15th will be 11 hours - essentially 12hr days. They also scheduled people for this Saturday with just a few days' notice after failing to incentivize enough people to volunteer and receive points that can be used in this ridiculous market place the company teamed up with to buy random shit. That's not gonna pay the bills. 

All it took was one person to bravely post how the email attributes the recent attrition to the need to schedule more hours, yet they continue pushing people out the door. The responses in solidarity flooded in. My favorite response in the whole thread was a GIF of Tituss Burgess with the caption ""Me reading the email: If you wanted me to quit, just say so."" I'm just picturing the managers getting a call tonight warning them to brace themselves for the shitstorm they're gonna face tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lsp0jm/management_sent_out_an_email_telling_us_well_be/,1614310792.0,105,1.0,24,antiwork,lomojamesbond

lsf5eb,I remember when I nearly got fired for mishearing something on a phone call because the entire office was singing Happy Birthday.,"Man, not long since found this sub, and I love it. The stories of cesspit employers are interesting, so I thought I‚Äôd chime in with one of the worst places I‚Äôve worked at. Warning, it‚Äôs fairly long!

Several years back, I worked Collections in a loan company. The fraud team at the time was literally just 1 guy. It was a start-up that got too big for its boots REALLY fast. So, this guy literally just couldn‚Äôt take holiday. Course, they‚Äôd never have said that to him, but it was implied. We were mates, so I said if he trained me, I‚Äôd cover for him for 5 days. 

On the day he was meant to train me, the day before his holiday, his manager made him join in a forced lunch - one of those cliquey cult-like meetings where they all ate in their shitty little work canteen and did nothing. He ended up having 45 minutes to show me the ropes.

Because of this &amp; trying to catch up on the afternoon‚Äôs work - approving loan applications, meaning they were all building up in a backlog - he had to rush a bit. He ended up paying out 2 fraudulent loans that day and they told him not to bother coming back from holiday. They then forced me to take the job as the only ‚Äúqualified‚Äù person to do it in the building (thanks to my extensive training!). 

For 2 years, I sweat bullets. I never made a single mistake in 10,000 applications because doing so meant the chopping block. During this time, they offered a job to a 5-year employee who was GREAT at his job in collections. He made a mistake in his first week and got tossed out - of the company, not just the team. 

Anyway, onto the title of the post. One day, as the company just loved fucking making noise, there was the usual weekly occurrence of the entire office signing Happy Birthday loudly to a colleague who sat nearby. Who cares if I‚Äôm on an important call to the bank / CIFAS, ‚Äòcause fuck me, right? 

I misheard a viral piece of information. Paid out a fraudulent loan into a brand new bank account (set up by a fraudster). 10,000 flawless applications, but fuck me, right? Pulled into a meeting within the hour. 

Manager - who was the antichrist - kept asking me why I did it. I said it was a mistake. 

‚ÄúIs it because you don‚Äôt care about your job?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, it was genuinely a mistake...‚Äù
‚ÄúBut would you say you didn‚Äôt care about your job?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt sounds like you want me to say I don‚Äôt care?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to say anything. I just want to know if you care?‚Äù 

I‚Äôm paraphrasing, but this was the really weird exchange. It was an odd place; they were all super obsessed with the job. Most of them were fucking. MOST senior managers who eventually moved on always came back because they couldn‚Äôt hack it elsewhere when they saw what an actual job is like. 

Anyway. ‚ÄúFortunately‚Äù, I have had a hearing impairment since I was younger. It‚Äôs not severe and doesn‚Äôt impact my life. I turned around and basically said that everybody was fucking singing happy birthday in my one decent ear and my disability made it impossible to hear properly. 

Her tune changed immediately and I was let off. After that, I fucking bolted within the month - into another job that eventually fired me because the job, it turned out, didn‚Äôt exist, and I wasn‚Äôt needed.

And their answer was ""on weekends, and at night if you like to"" and it was not even sarcastic, they were literally thrilled to have their whole day occupied by making other people rich and dealing with shitty people.
The last straw was someone that said ""you wanted a job? now you have one, deal with it""

lru530,A reminder that self employment is not the solution anti-workers are looking for,"I often get the feeling that people who want to understand our movement want to counter by saying that we should just all be self-employed. While self-employment would fix a lot of the problems many people have with traditional work it wouldn't solve the main problem which is the idea that you are a slave to the market. The idea that your worth is directly tied to your productivity is a terrible idea and anti-workers want to get rid of that.

In her episode [Burning Yourself Out, The Closest Feeling to Death that isn't Death](https://youtu.be/Mt-YuVhsvpY) Jaiden animation who is self-employed talks about her typical day of her work. She talks about how every time she isn't working she feels like she should be even though she's doing something like eating, pooping, or even working because if she's working she could be working harder. This video perfectly illustrates how self employment isn't the solution to anti-work people's problems, and in fact it's possible to work even harder and longer in self-employment than in traditional work because there's no one telling you to stop working. Getting rid of the market's desire to always turn a profit and the constant need to make money in order to survive is what's going to help us, not self employment. If you are self-employed that's great. There are plenty of reasons to be self-employed but to escape anti-work problems is not one of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/lru530/a_reminder_that_self_employment_is_not_the/,1614217700.0,85,0.96,16,antiwork,[deleted]
lrtl8y,"No matter how many articles suggest that working less increases productivity, employers will never get it","For those who have ever felt burnt out or overwhelmed at work, I believe that many of you have searched for and read articles about the negative effects of burnout, how productivity falls down a cliff when people work 50,60 hours a week, and the benefits of working less. However, despite these things being absolutely true from our experiences and in most studies, employers seem to never get it- or get it, but refuse to acknowledge it, even if it benefits both the worker and the company. 

This week I‚Äôve been overloaded at work and have been putting in minimum effort on each project because anything more means that I won‚Äôt be able to finish my assignments, or will have to use my non-existent free time and risk burnout. My work quality has been suffering, but I couldn‚Äôt care less, because this is a result of bad scheduling on the company‚Äôs side. 

No amount of productivity hack or time management skills will make the situation better.

lr67tq,"You're right.....I'm just here for a paycheck and am not invested in the store/business' success. No, I don't see the problem.","Quick summary: I'm a grad student with a part time job in a shoe store.

A couple of my bootlicking co-workers have expressed annoyance at me lately because I don't seem ""invested"" in the job and that my attitude seems to be ""I'm only here for a paycheck"".

Damn straight I am only there for a paycheck. What other reason would I have for working a boring job selling overpriced shoes? I would never work an unfulfilling day in my life if I were to win the lottery and would spend my time travelling, being in nature, being with friends and family, and my ""job"" would be volunteering with animals. 

No, I'm not ""invested in the store's success"". I don't get paid enough to care if the store thrives or not. I am a part time worker with no managerial responsibility. That is in intentional decision. I don't want that responsibility, so I didn't sign up for it. I'm don't get paid a cent over minimum wage, and I'm not paid for my time opening or closing the store. I come and do my 12 hours a week every week and they are the only 12 hours a week I think about the place and give it a second thought (other than this post lol). 

I don't care if I close a sale or not. I'm still getting paid the same crap hourly wage whether a customer buys the shoes or not because the business intentionally makes the store's sale targets unrealistically high (especially in the current economic climate) so they don't have to pay the promised bonuses if it is achieved. And the bonus is so pitiful anyway (something like 1% of the amount made over budget divided among us according to hours worked) that it doesn't really work to motivate me. I'm not going to bust my ass and stay 15 minutes after my finishing time in the hope of making a sale to get an extra $2 bonus at the end of the month or something.

The other day, they got angry at me because I said I couldn't (ie: didn't want to) go in on my weekend off because my co-worker was unwell. They demanded to know why. I told them my University semester started on Monday (I'm in NZ) and I needed to prepare and start things for my classes. The truth is that I just didn't fucking *want* to. I was tired and wanted to enjoy my last free weekend before having to dive into readings and assignments. And that is my god damn *right*. I had done my 12 hours for the week and was on my rostered time off where I owed them nothing. They were also angry I didn't answer my phone at 7am on a Sunday. Fuck *off*. I don't owe you being awake early on my days off. You are not entitled to my time at any point outside my rostered hours. I don't have to take your call on my day off. You're lucky I was I nice enough to phone you back when I woke up at 10am instead of waiting for my next shift to see what you wanted. 

They were pissed because they had to close the store early and they expect me to feel bad about it. It is not my fault the business has been short staffed for weeks. That is a ""business"" problem, not a ""telepathy99"" problem. I showed up for my rostered shifts. I don't owe them keeping my weekend off free. Another co-worker got in trouble for being out of town and being unable to come in when I said I couldn't.....they asked her why she went away knowing they are short staffed and they only have 1 or 2 people ""spare"" at any point. The fuck? Again, that is a ""business"" problem, not a ""her"" problem (or a ""me"" problem). Hire and train another staff member if you want more backup when someone is sick, but keep in mind that people don't owe it to you to drop everything and come in on a day off unless we are being paid a part wage to be on call during that time, which we are not. 

I don't care about the business. I don't care about making sales. I am not going to keep my schedule clear outside my rostered hours in case you need back up. It makes no difference to me if someone buys the shoes or not. I don't fucking care. The business isn't my baby or my livelihood. It is a job I have while studying and living at home to have something on my resume for the future when I need a better job, and to pay for things like my phone bill/clothes/going out with friends so I'm not asking my parents to pay for those things.

It is a minimum wage part time job.

We are born and nobody asks us what we want. First forcibly send to school by our parents, who see no way out off the rat race better than educate us to a system that makes us rats in a maze we will never get out off. Our imagination and creativity killed by hours and hours of brainwashing other people's thoughts into our minds... So we become more compliant when we grow up.
Them some of us go to the University. Others just get to work. Never the less is all the same.
If you want to survive give us all of your life. Pay the price of existing by giving us your time, body, mind, soul.
We are nothing more than whores to capital, to the 1%. Politics and philosophy are just smoke screen. This world is about making money. You are nothing.

lc4dhq,Had my first group interview today...,"And I could only describe it as the most dystopian thing I've ever had happen to me.

So the group interview is what it sounds like, there were four applicants and we all sat in the same room and the interviewer would do ""popcorn"" questions for each of us. Group consisted of 3 young guys and a middle aged man.

I was a one of the 3 young guys. I have experience with public speaking and its no problem for me and I react fairly well to questions I'm not prepared for, so the actual interview wasn't a problem. But it freaked me out as we went along and learned more about the other applicants,

So the vast majority of people do not react well to being put on the spot in a group of strangers. Hell, I'm only decent at it because my time in the military forced me to. And the middle aged gentleman struggled a bit with it. I don't want to give away too much info but the man was asked the question ""If you could have any super power, what would it be?"" He struggled a bit and finally decided on ""The power to take any pain away from my children if they have any from my divorce""

And I realized I absolutely hated this kind of interview. I really hope that guy gets the job.

Fuck those people. $16.34 in my area is bare minimum despite being 233% times the poverty line. 

* I drive my car into gas stations with so little gas the car has stopped calculating the remaining miles -- even before the pandemic I barely drove anywhere. 
* I eat beans and rice for most of my meals.
* I live in the cheapest apartment I could find that wouldn't give me cancer, accounting for 38% of my total monthly income.
* I feel privileged to have bought a gaming computer in better times but it remains my sole source of entertainment as it costs pennies in electricity to operate.
* I can't afford clothes. 
* My credit score is above average for my age. I have zero missed payments.
* I pay $2400/yr for health insurance that I can't afford to use.

$15/hr is borderline starvation in this hellhole of a country. The economy is NOT the best it has ever been. Fuck these people, I want my labor to be capable of feeding myself but apparently that's too much to ask for.

layi6j,Fuck your oppressors. Look after your health.,"tldr: they* want you weak and in bad health. fuck up their days, and take care of yourself.

junk food is everywhere, cheap and easy to get, the perfect product of capitalism in that it costs nothing to make, can be sold at a huge markup, and stimulates a desire for more junk food. don‚Äôt fucking eat it.

if a job requires you to sit (or stand) for hours at a time, do not stay. they* don‚Äôt care about you, they just want you to be a battery until you give out. sit if you need to, get up, walk around and stretch. it is going to stimulate blood flow to your limbs. your blood flow is your life force and it is worth more than the shitty wage they are paying you.

they* are trying to get you worried and anxious about shit you will never be able to fucking control, spamming your mind with endless noise. if you live in fear, you are easy to control. if you can‚Äôt change it, shut it out. 

ill health will make you a big spender, endlessly fruitlessly searching for a relief from the pain: pain pills, back braces, high blood pressure medication, anti-anxiety meds, weight loss ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù, alcohol, sunlight lamps, white noise machines, adult coloring books, anything advertised with the phrase ‚Äútreat yoself‚Äù, goddamn junk food. capitalists heard ‚Äúan oz of prevention is worth a lb of cure,‚Äù and knew where the big profits were.

NOTHING is worth your physical health. protect it with everything you have. your body is your only constant companion in this life. everywhere you go, there you are, and you will never escape yourself as long as you live. you may be disposable trash to them*, but don‚Äôt let that influence how you view yourself.

*anyone who profits off you, and what you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/layi6j/fuck_your_oppressors_look_after_your_health/,1612280521.0,116,0.99,9,antiwork,namedroppingmycats

I expected more from them; to be made aware if I wasn‚Äôt up to par, but it was a huge surprise for me and I just... fucking work man. I show up on time, and often leave late. 

I was ‚Äúnot performing at the rate they expected‚Äù even though after a week I was excelling. Got told I seem ‚Äútoo overwhelmed‚Äù and that the job can be a lot and they need someone who can take it. Maybe my ‚Äúongoing health issues are contributing to it‚Äù they say. Fuck me for being off for a week and a half because I was sick in a pandemic. Fuck me for getting upset a few times because I‚Äôd been at work since 7:30am and it‚Äôs 7:30pm and I should have been home half an hour ago. 

They were so nice, and our ethics lined up perfectly. I forgot that it‚Äôs still a business and that I am just a cog in the machine. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre sick. Doesn‚Äôt matter if your relatives have passed. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre being overworked. Doesn‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs a fucking pandemic.

None of my so-called ‚Äòfriends‚Äô understand this; and this makes me feel incredibly alone and isolated.

k6wdo3,Fuck the United States of America. Working here is bullshit.,"Income tax is theft. The very concept of the taxation that we face today would have sent our forefathers reeling. The process by which certain taxation regulations even got passed has been shrouded in illegal deception and manipulation.

Today I was reading about the extent and level to which the United States government is trying to regulate cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was created as the antithesis of this. All of this.

The manipulation and deceit surrounding the federal reserve has been astounding. It admittedly caused the Great Depression. We have layers upon layers upon layers over this stinking onion of people's greedy little hands just trying to get any piece of the pie that they can. Banks provide a service in lending, but why are we subject to seizure in our personal accounts from an entity that is so intertwined and incestuous with the government that they both might as well be called Big Brother?? 

At 18 I had a bank account that I accidentally overdrafted getting gas - the charge did not show up until later and I did not know I was over by $2. Two. Dollars. My bank charged me an overdraft fee every single day. At the time I was working 30 hours a week in a minimum wage job while in college full time. I did not have a dime to my name. Without the college meal plan I would not have eaten. And believe me I'm paying that college meal plan back a decade and a half later in interest charges alone. I have not even touched the principal. Anyways, I went into the bank to plead with them to stop the charges. I begged. I cried. Nothing could be done. It hit $200 and the only reason it stopped was because thankfully there was a cap for student checking. I had to pay it off because if I did not I was told it would ruin my credit.

Speaking of credit - everything we purchase in the US is based on owing someone something. We own nothing here. Every asset can be seized by our government at any time, for any number of reasons which may or may not be valid. Who cares? Who is going to protest when there are a number of ongoing protests already happening with no one even blinking an eye? We might as well just put our heads under water and scream into nothingness.

Banks own us. And by proxy the government owns us. The way the government regulates inflation is through the banking system. It's a joke. We are all slaves to an agenda and a system that is milking us for all it can. We eat the preservative encrusted food it pushes at us (I'm looking at you sugar industry), and we get fat on the thought that we are free. We must be anyways because we are allowed to say that.

But are we really? Anything we say can and will be used against us by a court of our peers. People lose their jobs over something stupid they said on a social media platform. Yeah, I get it, racists shouldn't be allowed to be employed in a role where their disgusting personal beliefs might affect their service. But it's a slippery slope. Motive in the eyes of the law holds an utmost importance. But in the eyes of the cancel culture judge and jury ignorance is no excuse. Even if what you meant to say was taken out of context entirely. So how are we free when something that is harmlessly said might cause you to lose a job - which in this country might mean the difference between a roof over our heads or sleeping on cardboard outside? I get it, ostracization as a social reinforcement for behavior and a culture that is against what we as a people want, is a necessary tool. It's been used for biological and evolutionary reasons by all species. But what happens when the lines between what you are ostracized for blur, and it starts to feel like you can't say, do, be anything other than what you are told you are allowed to think, believe, and feel?

We are 27 trillion dollars in debt. An unfathomable sum. By a country that states a reason for the federal reserve is to help control inflation? Why are our justifications swallowed like a spoonful of sugar when they constitute excessive and inexcusable hypocrisy?

Just today, reading about the crackdown on cryptocurrency. The US said it needed to do so under the excuse that cryptocurrency funnels illicit activity. WHAT ABOUT THE 400 BILLION DOLLARS WACHOVIA BANK FUNNELED FOR THE CARTEL??? Those were United States dollars motherfuckers. Everything is just swept under the rug.

The middle and lower socioeconomic classes received next to nothing in terms of relief during the pandemic. While evil corp Walmart who feeds every dollar it can into third worlds regimes to get bottom of the barrel prices in roundabout ways (through the companies who own the products they sell), is allowed to up and up their GPM's while paying their employees so low a bulk majority of people have no choice but to get food stamps. People who wake up and breathe and work their asses off only to be told they need ""government hand outs"" to survive. Let alone thrive. Let alone wake up and have a hope and a prayer on formulating a plan for a different life that does not involve entities exerting their power, keeping it looming over everyone's heads. People who were forced to work during the pandemic, people who remain the most at risk population for getting sick and ending up on the streets because of it.

One time I overhead two judges talking about how the fines for someone driving with a suspended license were not high enough, and that $200 was nothing. But if you've ever been there, you know that to some people $200 is everything. The mindsets and the understanding in this country is so fucked from individual to individual. The people making the rules can never fathom the day to day of the vast majority of the population. And this is a democracy?

We're in the matrix, an ever-spinning web of officials and laws and regulations and backdoor agendas, draining each and every one of us in this country from every orifice they can until we're old useless turnips, and then we're tossed onto the heap pile. Work, work, work. You can reward yourself with a McDonald's burger. An ice cold coca-cola. Six hours of TV a night until you're bleary eyed and useless, and maybe on drugs to numb the grey of monotony and shackles.

Human sovereignty is not this. Education is at an all time low. Family values are even lower. Both parents in the rat race, barely affording the cost of keeping the kids in daycare. Who can buy a house without a leg up from mom and dad? Commercials about medicines who side effects cause more symptoms than the illness itself. Yet we go into doctor's offices and ask for them by name. Our meat factories are places of actual evil, what we allow each other to put into our mouths to make a bigger profit margin is poison.

What is lower than this? In my opinion we are reaching the depths of the degradation of society?

Applied for a job, got told I'd been put forward to the interview and to book my interview, only date was the morning after (today).

Get to the shop, and now they tell me it was a phone interview, no prior communication notifying me about this.

Decide to wait on a bench outside, since I wanted to do some shopping after the interview, so it didn't seem sensible to go home and come back out, or risk missing them while I was shopping.

Three hours later I decide to give up, do my shopping and go home, the whole time I'm checking my phone constantly to see if they're calling or have called.

hw0thr,Using the ADA to unchain yourself from workslavery.,"Hi I'm a sketchy attorney whose favorite color is darkest gray.

**The Problem:**

You're a 30 year old accountant/customer service rep/analyst/makebelievespreadsheetjobist that dreads the monotonous hell of waking up every morning at 6am to iron your shirts, eat a Whole Foods burrito, jump in your car and drive an hour so you can get to work by 8:00, get patronizing glances from your boss when you actually get in at 8:10, be generally unproductive for three hours since:

1. Other people are dropping their work off on you since you're the only person who knows how/cares to do it, and
2. You're fucking exhausted from getting little to no sleep and are generally unproductive until after lunch, at which point you squeak out the minimum amount of work to stay gainfully employed, and
3. You feel guilty because all the other people you know are struggling to get a job as good as yours; they're all working three part time jobs with no benefits, and
4. **You begin to question why you need to come into work at all given you can do 100% of your job from home in your pajamas. Your company is having you show up because fuck you, that's why.**

Long before I was an attorney, I had a job like this. I spent mayyyyybe 15 hours a week doing ""work"" and the rest of the time was spent surfing the internet and stressing over trying to look busy for when my boss strolled over and SOWHATCHAWORKINGON'd me. I was told for years that if you just kept your head down and performed, you'd get promoted. Of course, these promotions invariably went to management's lunch buddies or the female employees the bosses were cheating on their wives with.

I wish I'd known I wasn't alone in my absolute contempt for my workplace; moreover, that there were ways I could have been significantly happier without quitting, finding a new job, and starting the process all over again.

**The Law:**

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is, in my opinion, the most radically transformative federal law in the last 50 years. The quick read is that the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. There are several critical sections to the ADA, but today I'm only going to focus on Title I, which is employment discrimination.

The summary of Title I is this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*An employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known disability of a qualified applicant or employee if it would not impose  an ""undue hardship"" on the operation of the employer's business.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's break that down:

* An employer - almost anyone who employs you, except for churches, international treaty organizations (e.g. the UN), and a couple other outliers. The exception is that for the ADA to apply to an employer, the employer must employee at least 15 people.
* Required - ""not a suggestion.""
* Reasonable - ""not unreasonable"" (see ""undue hardship"")
* Accommodation - This is the fill-in-the-blank section. An employer must accommodate a disabled employee or applicant *so that they can enjoy the same benefit of employment as a non-disabled employee*. For example, a blind accountant must be provided with screen reader software/be allowed to bring a guide dog to work/etc. A quadriplegic employee might need a big list of accommodations. Basically, stick a pin in this idea for now: *an employer is required by law to accommodate your disability.*
* Known - your employer is only responsible to accommodate disabilities they know about.
* Qualified - This is the second big caveat; you have to be minimally qualified to do the job. For example, I've passed the bar exam in my state, but my sister (still a law student) hasn't. My sister cannot use the ADA to secure a job as an attorney because she hasn't met the minimum qualifications for the position.
* Undue Hardship - The third and final caveat, and the place every fucking boss in the fucking world will try and hide behind. Fortunately, courts and HR departments take a dim view of bosses that try and bitch about how it's ""undue hardship"" for you to get to work from home. That's not how this works. The law presumes that it \*isn't\* an undue hardship unless the accommodation requested really messes things up somehow. For example, if you were a construction worker or retail employee wanting to work from home, well, there's really no work you can do from home. If you're a spreadsheetologist, you can easily do your job from home.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rethinking the Hypothetical:**

Let's take that 30 year old who despises his make-believe job.

One of the big reasons he hates his job is because around 10:00am, he gets searing migraines that are so overwhelming he feels like he has to lie down. He doesn't take any medication, and he has no idea what's causing them.

Remember above where we talked about the law? We didn't discuss one critical word: *Disability*. The ADA defines disability as ""**a physical or mental  impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person  who is perceived by others as having such an impairment.**""

Keep in mind that just because our employee has migraines doesn't mean he has a disability. The migraines are only a disability under the ADA if they ""substantially limit \[a\] major life activity."" That's right, it is YOUR job to explain what the major life activity is. In this case, we'll say that these major life activities are *concentration, self-care, self-balancing, walking, communicating,* and *reading*.

Now we've proven that the 30 year old is disabled under the ADA. They are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations.

**Reasonable Accommodations:**

The reasonable accommodations must 1) allow the disabled employee to enjoy the same level of benefits of employment as a non-disabled employee, 2) not create an undue hardship.

*Remember: Deep down, bosses despise their workslaves. They will fight you.*

The employer CAN choose between two reasonable accommodations. For example, let's say our 30 year old hypothetical employee has migraines that are caused by harsh lighting. Rather than let the employee work from home, the employer can simply change the lightbulbs to be less harsh. Conversely, *if the employee doesn't know what's causing the migraines*, changing the lightbulbs is a non-accommodation.

DO NOT GIVE THEM THIS OPTION!!

Stick to your guns. If your disability can only be accommodated by working from home, explain to HR that there is no possible adjustment that can be made to the business environment. Do not compromise for ""fewer"" migraines.

**The ""Good"" Use of the ADA:**

A lot of people are simply unaware of their rights and are agonizing at a job they are qualified to do, but are miserable because of a disability. It might be something they themselves don't know they have, like ADD, PTSD, OCD, depression and recurring panic attacks.

\*Unfortunately, sleep apnea/insomnia is the ""bridge too far"". Plaintiffs have unsuccessfully attempted to sue their employers for not accommodating a later start time because they can't get enough sleep the night before. It's bullshit that it's not considered a disability, I know, but it's just something to be aware of.

\*Phobias have mixed results. Social anxiety resulting from a traumatic event that more closely aligns with PTSD will probably be considered a disability. An irrational fear of going to work probably won't be.

Visit a doctor, have them give you a diagnosis AND have them recommend you for accommodations. Keep in mind that while doctors will recommend you for ""reasonable accommodation"", they're not really supposed to since a doctor can't have an opinion on whether an accommodation is reasonable or not.

Your letter should look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To Whom It May Concern,  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. ContingencyFees visited my offices on XX/XX complaining of recurring severe headaches and dizziness. He voiced concerns that these headaches are causing a decline in his work performance because he can't control their onsets. I performed XYZ tests and a CT scan to confirm that Mr. ContingencyFees did not have a brain tumor, cancer or other brain abscesses.  It is my professional medical opinion that Mr. ContingencyFees suffers from chronic recurring migraine headaches.  
&gt;  
&gt;His migraine headaches routinely limit his normal activities and can arise without warning. He has an extensive diary dating from the past nine months when he began to track his pain. There appears to be no trigger or immediate cause, but the impacts of the migraines are lessened when Mr. ContingencyFees is at home and can safely lie down and turn down lights without embarrassment or discomfort.  
&gt;  
&gt;I therefore recommend that Mr. ContingencyFees be allowed to perform his work duties from home to the greatest extent his employer is able to accommodate him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;Doctor NoMalpractice

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""Bad"" use of the ADA**

**I** don't, in good conscience, **encourage you to fake a impossible-to-physically-diagnose disability in order to work from home**, **because** while it's likely **you'll never be caught**, *it's really unfair to all those other people who also want to work from home but aren't disabled.* You know, like, if your student loans got forgiven, think about how unfair it would be to all those other people who made all their payments already...?

Plus, it's kind of scumbag behavior, right? Having to pretend you have a disability so you can make your life substantially better? Think about how unfair that would be to your boss and your workplace! You're basically stealing from your company.

There are just so many people that would be hurt by you faking an impossible-to-diagnose-disability to get out of work. I can't even think of who those people might be because there are so many of them.

It's also just bad. Jesus would be so fucking pissed at you.

If everyone did it, no one would be a wageslave and how sad would that be? Who would be there to deliver my Amazon packages?

Most businesses couldn't survive if everyone suddenly started working from home (involuntary cough).

Don't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I hope this was a worthwhile read.

Law is purposefully confusing so that normal people don't understand what their rights are (cynical take, I know, but I worked in defense for a while...).

huy9gk,"I feel like I'm useless at everything. I hate myself. There is no way out of this except suicide, only I'm both a coward and don't want to hurt my loved ones. FUCK.","I can't seem to do anything. I dropped out of college for mental health reasons, I almost ended up killing myself. COVID knocked me out of my tax office job which I was never very good at to begin with and I didn't like it but I did it so I could survive. I tried Sonic just recently and had a breakdown almost every day before work because of the social interaction, fast paced working, and loud noises. I ended up crying uncontrollably in the middle of a shift and having to go home. I never came back.


I have autism, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. I'm disabled enough so I'm not good at anything but not disabled enough so that anyone cares.


IDK maybe I'm being overdramatic but I don't seem to be good at anything so far in this society and I don't know what to do. Do I just find another job that breaks me and hope I don't have a mental breakdown that forces me out of it? I'm so fucking scared for my future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/huy9gk/i_feel_like_im_useless_at_everything_i_hate/,1595294930.0,94,0.98,28,antiwork,future-googler-maybe

hule2x,"It's freaking me out how many people with $$ want to ""get back to work""","I'm not talking about people who really need to get paid, I get that.
I'm talking about people who are retired or working from home right now or have tons of savings. I talk to people all the time who really want to go back to ""normal."" And they look at me like I'm weird for not wanting to. 
Like people who don't have young children but are still very obsessed with ""we need to get these kids back to school!""
It seems like people are just super uncomfortable with parts of the machine stopping, and it weirds me out 
It's just like this constant angst I feel from so many people about ""when will things open again? I hope it's soon!""

huklte,this sub is better than therapy,"Honestly I am so so so so so so so so so so mad at the thought that therapy itself is always about getting me back to being able to be a productive functional member of society.
I am just a regular person with a lot of trauma. 
The society is hella dysfunctional. 
Like when they say ""here's how to fight through depression and keep going"" 
Like maybe we are just supposed to all be very depressed and not be all keeping on going? But that's not an option. So we all have all these individual mental health issues that lead back to so much trauma and horribleness living in this unnatural way.
I also just really like calling out the abusive system, because I have so many friends who for some reason cannot call it out or see it as bad and it makes me furious. 
Anyways, thank you to this sub for existing. It affirms my humanity more than regular therapy type stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/huklte/this_sub_is_better_than_therapy/,1595249113.0,211,0.97,33,antiwork,No_Recognition

hufnk2,"You ever just go outside and stare at the sky late at night, pondering it all?","I do this every night since I lost my job sometime ago. I actually have time to do it now.

All I can come back to is capitalism. We are so small and meaningless, the universe so insanely expansive and intriguing, and yet so many are so petty and so simple. It all really does seem incomprehensible how so many have buried their heads and taken their lashing day in and day out for so long. So many seem disenfranchised with the system, but you just can't get them to see what you see. They've just become so complacent with it all.

When I look up into this night sky, my mind goes wild with possibility of what this life in this world could be. Yet...  here we are, living whatever this fuckery is. If we really pry into it, it is so utterly terrible that it is difficult to comprehend the simplicity, the stupidity, the captivity of this life we endure under this system. I hate this fucking life and this fucking world to no end. Is death really the only way out? How can I do my part to free myself and maybe even others from wage slavery? Is there anything any of you do to such an end?

P.S - The idea of starting a worker co-op is intriguing, but I don't even know what kind of work I/we could do and I'm not exactly a guy with much for connections.",https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/hufnk2/you_ever_just_go_outside_and_stare_at_the_sky/,1595222874.0,100,0.98,14,antiwork,FightForWhatsYours
