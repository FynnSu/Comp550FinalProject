lu5ztm,Field report: being nice/complementary to your man,"Okay this sounds like common sense but bear with me lol!

Hubby and I have been together for seven years now and have had some stressful troubles with IVF recently etc. I think it’s quite easy to fall into a pattern of just speaking neutrally to each other with the occasional nagging about things. I realised recently, what would I be like to live with? Like he comes home from a competitive and cutthroat corporate job to a wife who is at best neutral, at worst grumpy and complaining. 

So the other night hubby offered to cook, he’s really not much of a cook and I enjoy cooking so I usually do it. Usually I would say “thanks. that was good, just next time I would XYZ” and list all the changes I think he should make. This time I was like “thanks! this is delicious, it’s fun and different when you make things for me!” and he beamed happily. He’s already planning his next meal to cook and has written on the calendar weekly nights he’s going to cook for me. This is a guy who has previously no interest in cooking at all!!’

He’s also bought a new hedge trimmer and mows the lawn and trims the hedges every second week which takes hours in the hot Australian summer sun. He’s quite proud of this and sometimes wants me to come and look and I think ugh and I don’t bother or I just say “nice. thanks”. I went out with cold drinks yesterday and took a couple of minutes to look at what he’s actually done and told him i thought the hedges looked great etc. 

I guess the female equivalent would be getting all dressed up and making effort to get just a lukewarm response. Would that inspire me to do it again or make me feel good? No. 

It’s not about falling over yourself to give insincere compliments or giving them a gold star every time they do something, it’s just a general mindset shift of remembering to be positive and pleasant. 

TLDR: I’ve started consciously being more positive to my husband and the effects have been great so far.

Does anyone else have any examples or experience with this?

1. Sexual fulfillment 
2. Recreational Companionship 
3. An Attractive Spouse
4. Domestic Support
5. Admiration

hwowgl,Tools for women to communicate with men,"I was browsing some of my old archives and I found a few items I thought would be helpful. RPW is all about providing you with RP relationship tools to understand how men actually work (rather than how BP society wishes they worked); if you don't understand how men actually work, you aren't going to date one successfully.  So I'm providing some snippets on the topics of Shopping, Problems, and How to Listen to Men.

**Shopping**

“Shopping” is a fundamentally different process for men and for women. 

For men, “shopping” is akin to hunting–you plan for the prey you wish to kill, decide where you can best locate it, go there, kill it, and return triumphant.

For women, “shopping” is akin to foraging–you go into the woods looking for items that are in season, ripe, and desirable, not knowing exactly what you’ll find but putting in the effort to search for what’s good.

The problem is, we call these two fundamentally different activities the same thing, which confuses people enormously. If a man is reluctant to go shopping with you, understand that how he sees it - and how you present it - matters, and are likely different.

**Problems**

When men talk about a problem, we’re looking for solutions. ADMITTING we have a issue that we can’t resolve is actually loss of face or status (hence the famous stereotype of not stopping and asking for directions). We’re giving up status to find a fix. (Of course we gain status by providing a fix when is why men are frequently eager to help…)

When women talk about a problem, they’re usually looking for comfort. Attempting to provide a fix just gets men in trouble. Problem is, most men have to consciously change mental gears to “Poor Baby” mode; it is not very easy to do. Men are usually insulted by “comforting” and, naturally, we don’t want to insult a woman. We have to work pretty hard to understand that this is not the case with women.

**How to Listen to Men (from Alison Armstrong)**

To create the kind of situation that enables men to communicate fully, remember this:

Make sure it is a good time to ask a question. This means when he is not doing anything else (including things you don’t think are important). To check, you can ask, “Is this a good time to ask a question?” Don’t take it personally if he says no and try again at a later time.

After you ask the question, give him time to think before he responds. He is not taking the answer off the top of his head, he is really thinking about it. That is the respect he is paying to your question. Just wait patiently while he thinks. If you prompt him, or rephrase your question, that will interrupt his thought processes.

Once he starts talking, don’t interrupt him. This includes a comment, objection or another question.

Watch nodding your head excessively, or agreeing verbally. This can also be an interruption.

When it seems like he is finished, listen “one minute longer.” Do this until he says he is done. When he takes a breath, don’t jump in. While men are accused of being “shallow,” they are actually the opposite. They are like deep, deep wells. If you don’t give him a chance to draw up another bucket, you will only get what was on the surface.

Make sure you are safe to talk to — this means that *you can’t have a “right answer” in mind.* If his answer will get him in trouble with you, he can tell this and is likely to not answer at all. The odds of him answering the question the way you would are slim, be willing to be surprised and learn something from him.

Appreciate him for answering your question. Even if you didn’t like the answer, he honored your question with a response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/hwowgl/tools_for_women_to_communicate_with_men/,1595541064.0,145,0.91,30,RedPillWomen,LateralThinker13

huvlmo,Red-pilled concepts and lessons from Groundhog Day (useful for red-pilled parenting),"The other day my family watched the movie Groundhog Day, and I thought this film was a a good jumping off point to discuss some red-pill concepts with my kids. Although films and fictional books are generally not discussed here, I think the culture around us is a huge force that shapes us with blue pill beliefs. For example, the character, Maggie O'Connell on the TV series *Northern Exposure* ruined me for years. Based on the sexual tension between her and the male lead character, I thought that men liked abrasive, sassy women, and that sweet women were boring doormats. It took years to rectify this misconception, and I certainly don't want my children to fall into this trap.

Also, picture is worth a thousand words. Film moments can convey to concepts in ways that reading words on a screen can't. So, having said all this, I'd like to explore some of the red-pilled concepts and examples in the movie Groundhog Day.

The premise is that Phil (played by Bill Murray) a weather anchorman is stuck in a time loop where he re-lives the same day over and over in a small town that he's visiting with his co-workers.

The love interest, Rita (played by Andie MacDowell) is a good example of a **strong feminine woman**. These are some of the things I want my daughter to cultivate.

* **She's kind, compassionate, sweet, and playful**. She may admonish Phil's bad behavior, but she is not abrasive.
* **She is** **a woman with a career, not a career woman**. She wants to do a good job as a producer, but she is not overtly masculine in the way she goes about doing her job, or overly aggressive. She get's it done in a feminine way. I also got the impression that she would want to be a wife and mother.
* **She has** **strong boundaries**. Although she is sweet and kind, she does not hesitate to put her foot down when Phil pressures her into sex. And when he crosses a line, she slaps him.
* **She also has a good vetting filter**. She is repelled by him when he is a jerk and suspicious when he games her. When he finally changes into a HVM, then she is attracted to him.

Phil undergoes his own transformation from a jerk to a HVM. Starting out as a cynical, not-so-nice guy, he looks down on the small town folk. Initially he uses the time loop to engage in debauchery. Then he tries to game Rita over and over, using accumulated knowledge from her to help his game. After being rebuffed repeatedly, he becomes destructive and tries to commit suicide unsuccessfully.

In the last stage, Phil decides to undergo a process of improving himself and to help the people around him. He begins to exhibit the traits that I want my son to have:

* **He works on himself.** Phil decides to take piano lessons, learns how to sculpt ice, reads literature.
* **He is internally motivated.** He's improving himself not to get some girl, but for himself. That is something I often see in MRP, where guys are embarking on self improvement to gain approval of their wives, only to be told that they need to refocus the frame on themselves.
* **He finds his own mission.** He decides to use his knowledge of what's going to happen to help the townsfolk. He goes around town changing a tire for old ladies, catching a kid who falls out of a tree, and saving the life of a man who's choking.
* Rita is not his mission: When Phil delivers a heartfelt speech during his news segment, Rita beginning to feel intrigued by him and asks if he wants to have coffee. Instead of jumping on that opportunity, which his old self would have done, he responds that he would love to but he has some errands to run. These ""errands"" are his mission of helping out the townsfolk. He has a responsibility and an obligation to do good, and that takes precedence over chasing skirts. He maintained frame.

At the end of the film he becomes a HVM. Rita finds him playing jazz piano at a party. People are constantly coming up to him and thanking him for something he's done. There is a bachelor's auction where Phil is auctioned off and women are fighting over him, outbidding each other. The red-pilled would immediately recognize that this is a demonstration of social proof: **women want men that other women want.** Seeing that other women are bidding on Phil, Rita outbids them all and gets him for the night. She is now intrigued and attracted to Phil. At this point, I casually commented to my son that chasing women and trying to convince them to be with you is a weak strategy. Rather, it's a much better strategy to become an amazing man, and then women will more attracted to you.

All in all I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. I hope you get a chance to watch this with a red-pilled lens and see if you can apply some of these concepts to your life. I certainly will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/huvlmo/redpilled_concepts_and_lessons_from_groundhog_day/,1595285095.0,100,0.91,4,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

h7ls6q,How can we better appreciate our men for their hard work (dating)?,"My boyfriend works in truss manufacturing. It pays decently, but it's a ***tough*** job. His shifts are from 5a - 2p during the week days, the job is very physically demanding (long stretches of swinging a hammer/standing/squatting/climbing), and he's frequently dirty or dusty when he clocks out because the sawdust sticks. In the summer, the temperature of the facility he works in goes up into the 90s, so the sweat/grime/dirt is even worse. He also has to work with other guys that he does not like due to their crudeness and the way they're constantly breaking each other's balls. Despite all of this, he's determined to stick with the job for just long enough so that he has the credentials to get a better job in construction later on. And he's told me before that part of why he does the hard work is ""for me.""

I regularly tell my Captain how I respect him for powering through, what a tough man he is for taking on such a demanding job, etc. However, we don't live together, so I am limited to a degree in what I can do to make him feel like a king when he's around me (e.g. I can't have food and a sweet kiss waiting for him when he gets home from work). And even though he looooves the way I look, I sometimes feel like wearing a dress and looking pretty is not really what will help him rejuvenate after a hard week, like I'm sort of flaunting the privilege of looking nice every day because I'm spoiled enough to not be working my ass off and getting my hands dirty like he is.

**To the ladies whose men have demanding jobs/careers, what else can I (or, rather, we) do for my (our) Captain(s) to really build him up when he's not at work and we're together?**

gzqgml,Getting to the ring in less than a year and a half,"Hi everyone,

I've lurked here under various accounts for years and I've learned a lot, so I thought I would tell you my story.

In addition, I wanted to share some advice on how to navigate the relationship period in between dating and engaged. For me, this felt like a very long time when I couldn't find much RP advice on how to deal.

# My background (feel free to skip)

I went to a women's college and was a hardcore feminist in the past. I spent my 20s focusing on my career and moving around and being an introvert lone wolf. I found RPW in my late 20s and first came here to mock it, then came here to learn. 

I had to admit to myself that yes, I did want a husband, I did want to have babies, and I even would love to stay at home with the babies. I spent time in nun mode and did a lot of RPW reading (Fascinating Womanhood - both books, Laura Doyle's Surrendered Single, this sub, etc).

My man and I met each other through OkCupid last January, when we were both 31. We connected right away. Even though we met so late, we feel like we are high school sweethearts because both of us were inexperienced before this. So, I doubt my story is typical, but it can happen.

At my age, this felt like my last chance. I have some advantages that helped me still have a high SMV at 31:

* A baby face. I look young and still get carded. I recommend getting a good skincare routine down. I'm obsessed with Korean skincare for that youthful glow.
* Low N-count. 
* Good body (Normal BMI range).
* Naturally feminine and childlike. 

Skipping ahead, he proposed a week ago and I'm still feeling that just-engaged glow. We moved in together in October and I was emotionally ready to get engaged then. So that was 8 months of waiting for him to pop the question! 

# Here are my tips for navigating the period when you are very committed but waiting for the ring.

**Let him decide on his own terms that he wants to marry you.**

You want your man to feel like he is deciding to pick you. It works best if he is leading the relationship and you are submitting.

**Let him bring up engagement if possible.**

If your man is high value and he loves you, he should not shy away from commitment. My man first said something like ""I could see spending my life with you"" and later, we talked more concretely.

**If you move in together, make sure you are on the road to get engaged.**

I know moving in before marriage may not be very RP, but in these times, men may expect to do so. My man was ready to move in before I was. When we had our conversation, I made sure that we were planning to get engaged before I agreed to move in.

**Never be a nag.** 

If you man wants to be nagged, he can call his mother. Never fall into a nagging, motherly role. You are the fun and cheerful girlfriend.

**Especially don't nag about a ring.** Discuss engagement and marriage as little as possible. Trust that he remembers the few, special conversations you have about it. Give him the space and time to make these decisions.

**A few months (yes, months!) after you've established that you want to get married 'someday', have a talk where you establish your expectations on a timeline.**

Around the winter holidays, we had a discussion about when we wanted to get engaged. I told him I wanted to in the next six months. 

Both of you agree on the timeline. Make sure he knows you will be disappointed if he doesn't meet this. Be high value and know what you deserve, which is to be engaged and not waiting years for a ring!

**Trust your man.**

Imagine he was the captain and you were the first mate of a real boat. He told you that you were headed to Engagement Island within a time frame. Would you constantly harass him wanting to know if you were still headed there and if you would make it in time? No, you would trust that you were on course. 

**He should come to you to discuss your ring preferences too!** And that's when you can reveal your secret Pinterest board detailing exactly what you want (lol).

**This time takes a lot of patience.**

Do not lose hope. Be patient. Manage your own anxieties and mental health. Journal out your feelings. It is feminine to be flexible and go with the flow. 

**As Laura Doyle puts it, be the Goddess of Fun and Light.**

The more feminine and playful you are, the more he is drawn to you. Be a tease. Be fun. You want him to daydream about you at work and smile to himself.

Keep expressing gratitude and joy. This way he is fully confident he can make you happy, and making you happy makes him happy.

**Stay the course.**

Even if you are moved in together, don't get complacent. Keep up your beauty routines. Cook for him. Keep your sex life active. Find time for cuddles. He is getting a preview of marriage with you, so make sure he likes this preview.

**Let go of certain expectations.**

Do not get set on it happening in a certain way, on a certain special date. If there is anything that Covid-19 has taught me, it's that you can't predict what disasters may strike.

Around January my man told me he would take me to Hawaii for a dream vacation in March. I knew he would propose then and we were both excited. He even hired a photographer for the big moment. Obviously, the trip was canceled.

**If you need to do so, reiterate how important engagement is to you.**

Men view engagement completely differently than we do. The truth is, you may have to bring up engagement if you sense he is not leading. Approach it as a problem that he has to find a way to solve.

After our trip was canceled, I didn't see any sign that he would still propose, and I was really down. Well, one day I let him know how I was feeling. I cried and was very vulnerable. I told him he could ask me when he handed me my morning coffee as I didn't need any fancy trip. I told him engagement meant a lot to me and the state of 'not being engaged' was stressing me out. 

After that talk, he proposed within a month.

This period can be really tough, but most RP advice still applies. If you've properly vetted, your man should step up and get you two there. 

Good luck. &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/gzqgml/getting_to_the_ring_in_less_than_a_year_and_a_half/,1591720003.0,101,0.86,34,RedPillWomen,upside-down-11
gzjccw,24 to 30 is the golden window of finding a HVM.,"The decision making part of the brain develops in  mid twenties, hence making you more wary of the reality of life and setting your priorities straight. Before that most people are in college/not taking life seriously, having wrong ideas about what a high value man is (for example caring too much about looks), not having enough life experience, are impulsive, etc. Also due to being around people mostly in your own age range in college, you are more likely to date them, without having a clear idea of what level of success this man can reach.

Also after the age of thirty, your options become limited. A lot of people are taken, you may become more critical and less likely to compromise because you waited this long to settle with the perfect partner, you may have lost some of your youthfulness if you haven't taken good care of yourself/partied too much, your fertility is more likely to be affected, etc.

From 24 to 30, you are wise enough to know your worth and not settle for something that will have no actual benefit to you. You have enough life experience to treat a man in a good way, you have a job and have a more clear idea of your goals, you are in your prime lookswise/know what kind of wardrobe suits you best, and you are more likely to meet people who align with your goals.

I'm not saying that before and after this age range there is no chance to find your ideal life partner. But this is the golden window for most women, and they should use it wisely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/gzjccw/24_to_30_is_the_golden_window_of_finding_a_hvm/,1591692898.0,89,0.84,78,RedPillWomen,Nibahbe
g2ed2f,"About to turn 27, and I've realized the truth about ""The Wall""","I discovered the Red Pill when I was 19, and I have lived in fear of aging ever since. So I have spent the past 8 years wearing sunscreen every two hours, eating 100% clean food (not even birthday cake), drinking minimally, and going to bed on time. I also began anti-aging skin products at 25. Like I was American Psycho-level about it, drinking collagen and refusing to go outside without my sun umbrella.

I'll turn 27 on May 29th, and I looked at myself in the mirror. I look literally the exact same as I did at 19. I have pictures, and there's no difference, except that I have more abs. The only difference is that I have two lines under each eye, and they are very small. I'm a graduate student, and everyone thinks that I'm 20 and is surprised to hear my true age.

Many of my friends, both male and female, have aged horribly. Like, they look like they're in their mid-30s at 25-26 because of poor skincare and diet and health. I know people think the Wall is just for women, but many of my male friends, especially the ones who smoked pot/were more hippie, look bad .

So I don't know if this comforts anyone, but the Wall has to do more with your life choices than it does age.

g1frqx,Gossip at work,"Background: I’m an introvert through and through and I work part time as an ICU nurse with my Captain’s full support. I know that women working can be a controversial topic on this thread but I’m reaching out to all of you anyway. 

I had my yearly evaluation, and while I got excellent marks, when I asked for constructive criticism, my female manager mentioned that I sometimes unintentionally come across as “holier than thou” and “uninterested” when around my peers. 

I work with mostly women, and the majority of conversations are petty gossip about other coworkers.  There are things I’ve overheard that I don’t think I should know about other people (rumors of a miscarriage or an embarrassing sex story, for example). Even as a young girl, when my mom would chat on the phone with her friends and gossip, I always felt bad for those women they were speaking harshly about behind their back. I never wished to be a part of it. 

At work, I’m friendly, I remember details about coworkers and ask them-about their daughter’s wedding, about their recent vacation, the health of their father, etc. I smile a lot, I bring in homemade baked goods, I get compliments and appreciation from my patients and their families, and I’m always there to lend a helping hand especially during emergencies. I simply find no meaning in putting others down. I’m thinking perhaps it’s a coping mechanism since the job can be often stressful and heartbreaking. I don’t have much in common with my coworkers, other than being a mother and a nurse. I’m not a big talker in general and never have been due to my introversion. If I don’t know someone well, I don’t trust them enough to know personal details about my life. 

How do I handle this gracefully as a feminine woman and continue to firmly set my boundaries? Have any of you experienced this in any type of environment?

g025jk,How to show your captain love,"So this may go against mainstream ideology where men are stoic and all that, but I find that my captain responds very well to me being proactively loving.

I keep his house and take care of his children and cook his meals, but he could have a housekeeper do that. What I'm talking about is the more interpersonal interactions you have with your captain.

For me, when he does something for me (whatever, go get groceries during this virus, fix the dishwasher, et cetera) I make sure that he knows I'm grateful. My usual tactic is to either hug and kiss him or sit in his lap plus hugging and kissing and straight up say ""thank you for that!""

I also make it a habit to try to proactively tell him every once in a while that he is amazing.  Example: ""Hey guess what?  You are such a great dad and partner! Here is why (list reasons why.) And here are recent examples (list recent examples.)

I also try to make sure proactively that he knows he's attractive to me.  Example, playfully smacking his butt and saying ""dat ass doe"" which always makes him laugh and smile.

We were irresponsible, slightly entitled, and very In The Moment with our decisions and lifestyle. Over time we helped each other become hard working, down to earth, and much more mature. I look at the progress we’ve made and while I’m proud of the man he’s become, he still has a way to go before I could consider him an alpha.

dsr9ah,Happy Talk,"The sub’s rules contain the instruction: ‘do not bad mouth your SO’. As far as I know, this goes back to the creation of RPW. Take that as an indication that it’s really important[.](https://images.app.goo.gl/sXAVBqJw49RWaiAU8) 

&amp;nbsp;

Focusing on your partners flaws will only make them loom larger in your mind. It is also a way that we shift responsibility from ourselves (something we can fix) to him (something about which we can only wring our hands and clutch our pearls). Problems can only be fixed if you acknowledge your own role. The more negative things you have to say about your man, the more you will teach yourself to dislike him. 

&amp;nbsp;

It goes further too. While I firmly believe that every woman should have a likeminded friend to confide in, if you spend too much of your time speaking ill of your partner, your friends and family will think ill of your partner. Your loved ones would be remiss to allow you to stay in a bad relationship with a bad man – so you see where this can cause problems to the long term stability of said relationship. 

&amp;nbsp;

But hey, you love him, so that’s not too hard. We might need a reminder from time to time, but all in all, a completely reasonable rule of life. 

&amp;nbsp;

My challenge to you this week is to not bad mouth *men*. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now there are plenty of lurkers out there who will want to burn me in effigy for this. *RPW serves the male imperative* they will say. *I only follow my husband* others will say. *Have you BEEN to TRP* will get thrown in there.

&amp;nbsp;

So I will elaborate. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do not believe that men are the ideal specimens of humanity, so far above women that we must bow before them. I’m also not advising you to defer to any man in the room simply for being male. The male imperative is often in opposition to ours, a fact that is evident if you visit the male subs. It’s not a secret to women over the age of 16 that men will say whatever they must to get in our pants, commitment is optional (*my husband once swore to me that mosquitos do not like still water in an attempt to con my pants off*). *So why do we not discuss these things more on RPW*? you may wonder. 

&amp;nbsp;

You are the sum of your thoughts and your actions. If you spend all day thinking how terrible men are, it will be difficult to turn off and engage lightheartedly with your partner. If you are always waiting to mistrust men, men will pick up on that and they won’t pick you up. If you spend your time discussing how all men are fuckboys and players then you are more likely to self sabotage by finding fuckboys and players. And if you come to RPW and talk about how you are surrounded by betas, then all you are going ever find are negative beta traits (*an aside: beta traits - not a bad thing. I’m so tired of hearing ‘beta’ as a pejorative. Leave that insult to the men. Ladies, we require beta traits if we want commitment and/or family*). Cognitive behavior therapy has been built and prospered around the idea of controlling your thoughts to your own benefit. 

&amp;nbsp;

[We do not need to be bitter and angry]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M). You cannot be a soft place to land if you have a permanent scowl on your face or if you are always on edge waiting for a man to do you wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I am not suggesting is a wide eyed naivete. Life is full of risks that we must do our best to mitigate. Use your brain. If you feel too emotional to make a good decision, move away from the situation. Vet your men well, do not believe what you are told if it’s not followed by action and don’t believe what you are told if it defies logic (*lest you end up covered in mosquito bites*). 

&amp;nbsp;

But don’t badmouth men. It conditions your brain to be negative and keeps you anxious in your interactions. Even if you don’t give a flip about men in general, that’s not a healthy way for *you* to go through life. 

&amp;nbsp;

Besides, you’d be so much prettier if you smiled.

I think that I get easily influenced by angry critics, the naysayers, who always seems right and if I'm happy and not upset about those things, I'm wrong.

dj1mop,Partner read my dream journal and now wants to date other women?,"I am a 28, he is 33, we have been in a committed monogamous relationship about one year. Today he texted me asking “are you dating other guys already?” Which completely took me off guard. I have not even come remotely close to dating anyone else; I make it a point not to hang out with other guys alone and make sure I have girlfriends with me. This is a change that I have made in order to continue our relationship together. 

It turns out he found my dream journal. In my dream I was on a date with a stranger who tried to put his arm around me. I remembered that I had a boyfriend and left. In the dream I was angry about being neglected by my partner and wanted to end the relationship (this is when he had been ignoring me with no explanation for 3 days in real life). Other parts of the dream included hurting my leg on an escalator and trying to lose my phone. The dream before that was one where I was getting chased by witches. 

I told him that what he read was just a dream that I had. He said that what he read was unacceptable and that he already had two dates set up for this week. 

I apologized and asked for him to allow me to explain myself and make it up to him. He said that he would allow that but that I would have to work hard to get things back on track and that he is still going on those dates. He brought up some other mistakes that I have made in the past as further reasoning behind his decision (which I had apologized for and changed my behavior accordingly).

I am really devastated by this. I am shocked that he basically broke up with me without trying to clarify or discuss anything about what happened. And I feel really frustrated because I don’t even really think I did anything wrong — I had a dream and I wrote it down. 

Prior to this, we had been in a monogamous relationship. I put in a lot of hard work and effort into this relationship — cooking, baking, dressing up, working out, wearing make up. Our sex life is great. I don’t know how I can try harder. I do all of this on top of a 70-80 hour work week. 

I am planning on making an apple cake and a shepherd’s pie to make up. I am hopeful that I can explain myself but I feel so discouraged. Do you think that his reaction is reasonable? Do you think my frustration is warranted? I don’t know how to proceed. Sometimes I feel like I try my hardest but can’t succeed.

diasdc,Doormat vs Deference,"Hello class and welcome to RPW 101: Basic RPW. Where I will ramble about the foundations of this sub, what we are and are not and how we can use these tactics to achieve our goals. Class meets whenever I feel inclined to write and you can find the syllabus in the back of the book – by which I mean my head, good luck getting it out[.](https://lizfortoday.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/1950_1.jpg) 

***

&amp;nbsp;

###By any other name...

Submission is one of the foundational ideas of RPW and it is a *very difficult* concept to understand for new members. People come into RPW all the time thinking that we are doormats who will bend over backwards and let a man do anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

The background that you bring to RPW will influence your view of submission. A Christian will have learned that she [submits to her husband out of reverence to her faith](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/submission-of-wives-to-husbands/). A BDSM sub will anticipate [a firm spanking]( https://theprincessfantasy.com/blogs/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-domestic-discipline-improving-your-relationship) if she steps out of line. The majority, will stand in the middle and look at each end of this spectrum and think: “where the heck do I fit in?”

&amp;nbsp;

Hypergamy leads us to seek out the best man we can find. When we say “women date across and up” this means we are attracted to men who are better than us *in some way*. He might be stronger, he might be smarter, have a better job or socially higher status. We are attracted to the confidence in these men. They make us feel safe, protected and cherished. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is fitting because men want to feel competent in their lives and in their relationships. Men often ask themselves [if they measure up]( https://redd.it/8f6upu). Rather than being protected and loved, men wish to feel [respected and admired](https://redd.it/8cnh7l). Submission at heart, is the way we behave to show men the respect and admiration that they crave. 

&amp;nbsp;

But the *word* submission is a sticking point for many. If your modern Western brain struggles with the word *submission*, consider instead *deference*.  We defer to others on a regular basis: to bosses at work, to teachers in school, to those with more knowledge and experiences than we have or those who take on responsibilities we do not want. 

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever word you use to describe the practice, it does not mean you need to be less than what you are. You defer to a professor because they have more knowledge than you, not because you are stupid. You defer to the manager because they have more authority and responsibility than you, not because you are incapable. You defer to your partner because you love him, not because you can't function on your own. You need not be weak so another can be strong. 

&amp;nbsp;

A doormat is a woman who will make herself weak to assuage the ego of a weak man. Submission is a tactic that anyone can use, and it *can* be used this way. Any man will appreciate being shown respect (remember: [it is how they love]( https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8zvaif/i_love_him_but/)). The person you are harming is yourself. 

&amp;nbsp;

Instead, find the best man you can. A man whose vision for the future aligns with your own. A man you respect. If you don’t *want* to follow his lead then he’s not the right man. If you think his plans are terrible then he’s not the right man.  If your life goals are at odds then he’s not the right man. If he asks you to set yourself on fire because he's chilly, *then he's not the right man.*

&amp;nbsp;

Choices should be made that are in the best interest of the family and the relationship. Do not quit your job that you love because he wants to be the sole provider. Quit your job because you both believe it is the best way to raise children. Do not STFU when your husband is about to make a wrong turn because you fear embarrassing him (*seriously Laura Doyle, wtf*). STFU because mowing the lawn is his responsibility and you trust him to manage his own to-do list.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m a firm believer that most women are happier with a man than without a man. I do not believe that women are better off with *any* man. Do not blindly follow a weak man. The risk to your own self worth and the relationship are great. (I know a woman who got herself a stress fracture tolerating a weak husband). Do not make yourself into a foot stool so he can kick back and relax --- unless you are into that sort of thing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Submission - trusting his judgement, deferring to his knowledge, following his vision - is what you do to demonstrate that you respect a respectable man. If you show him love in the way he desires it, he will cherish you all the more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/diasdc/doormat_vs_deference/,1571158754.0,183,0.96,60,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

dg9bbh,So I Met Someone,"Well, I decided I'd Post This Here just to see what you fellow ladies think..

First of all, I am a 27 year old black female(virgin), who really hasn't put herself out there on the dating scene, due to self-esteem issues(12 years of my school years being heavily bullied for not being like my peers) and a Overprotective Sheltering Mother, but now that I'm 27 I've decided enough is a enough, if my Mom(45) can go with a guy one year older than me, she can't say a thing about me finally going into the dating scene and wanting to look pretty and cute for a change.

A Fellow Employee of mine suggested that I try online dating...Now I'm one of the nerd gamer type like girls, who really is happy and peppy most of the time(IF I take my iron pills like I'm supposed to), I also look ALOT younger than 27, people assume I'm 19 or in my early 20's, for years I've seen this as a set back, but now I've started to see it as a advantage. I'm also a Web Designer, eventually I will move from the town I'm in as it really doesn't cater to technological degrees.

Met this guy on OkCupid,(white, 31), very handsome, one of those ""bear"" types yanno. He's into anime/gaming, conspiracy theories and other silly things in nature, like I am. He renovates and refurbish homes and sells them, by night he works for Uber Eats. So, he always keeps himself working, something I like. He was very excited to meet me, so eventually we do meet after I get off of work..

We had dinner, we went to a Thrift Shop, had Boba Tea, it was my first date and I enjoyed it, I was happy and genuinely smiling, he was shy at first, but as the date went one he got more confident and relaxed as he could see I was clearly having a great time.  Last Date I've ever had was 10 years ago, it was a Prom Date, and it was more of a Trashy Club Party, than a Prom, so I don't really consider that day a date. But, I had fun with this guy I met online.

I also had my first kiss that night, don't know if it was too fast, but I did enjoy it...However he has told me about his past, he was once married when he was alot younger. His Parents are also Massive Bible thumpers and don't allow him to come to family visits, due to his previous wife being Bi-Sexual, as a Christian myself, I think it's appalling what they did to him.

What Advice Do You Ladies Have? Is it possible to find the right guy for the very first time or should I date more first(he's told me to take as much time as I need) Also for his past do you think I can do something about it, what should I do? His Birthday is coming up soon, should I do something for him or not(I've been thinking of baking him a cupcake)?

dfixcs,"""You're so sweet it makes my life so much easier""","Hello ladies and lurking lads! 

I've made a Happiness Sundae, all sweetness.

Today my boyfriend said something that I think made both of us very happy. I was just doing my hair and he popped into the bathroom to simply tell me ""You're so sweet, it makes my life so much easier."" I smiled and said ""AWH REALLY?!"" and he said ""Yes, you give me all this motivation and energy. It's been a bad month at work and every moment I've been around you has made it durable."" I obviously stopped doing my hair to give him a ton of kisses. 

This is a field report because I suffer from mental illness and am an incredibly anxious person. I am also an immensely outwardly expressive person, if I'm happy, you know/feel it if I'm sad, it's all over my face. So I re-read Surrendered wife (it's basically my bible) and remembered: ""soft place to land"". So I've been focusing on ""sorting out my moods"" while I'm alone so that I can be my better side (my REAL self) around him, since we only see each other a few hours every day. 

So assume my sweetness is the icecream of this sundae.

IT WORKED THAT QUICKLY. Why though? Simple - he loves ice cream! and why else? I LOVE ICE CREAM TOO! So as a result, I feel so much better. I can tell that my energy changes how much I want to work towards improving our lives, pushing out a positive energy a ""sweetness"", made me more motivated and allowed me to enjoy the present more. He then gets that energy too. 

The caramel drizzle? Was his response to it all. I've made him so happy, JUST BY BEING A HAPPY PRESENCE!! 

Let's throw some sprinkles on this sundae too because my sweetness has increased how much he pays attention to my needs/moods. He's quicker to ask me if I'm okay. Instead of thinking- asking if I'm okay will open up a can of sad worms. He has also asked more about the things that make me less-sweet and has helped me work towards that (my finances stress me out for example, so he offered to draft me up a new budget and took over the internet bill). I think it's because he's less worried about my reactions, he can gauge me better.

Cherry on top? He took me out to this new restaurant I've been dying to go to and every morning for the past two weeks has been a frisky one. 

His hugs are tighter, kisses are longer and he lingers around the kitchen when I'm making dinner instead of going on the computer because he wants to be around me more.

Basically moral of the story? Don't underestimate the power of your own positive attitude!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/dfixcs/youre_so_sweet_it_makes_my_life_so_much_easier/,1570636134.0,284,0.96,23,RedPillWomen,countrylemon
devf2e,Frustrated about the college hookup scene,"I came into college a virgin, and going into my second year still am, but it frustrates me to no end seeing how others engage in the hookup culture. Pretty much every single girl I know (hot or ugly, party girl or girl next door, religious or not) has had some sort of casual sex experience. All of the girls I live with (suite style apartment on campus) have had one night stands and fwbs. I recently saw a guy from a nearby school (so attractive, tall, witty, well built, Ivy League) but came to the harsh realization when he stopped messaging me that he was probably only in it to get into my pants. 

I don’t want to have sex for the first time with some stranger, but seeing all my friends get action while being sexually frustrated and horny myself but without any sort of relationship options has just made me so jaded and full of despair. A friend told me I’m a relationship girl, and I think I am, but it seems like all of the guys I find attractive aren’t interested in relationships at this age (and probably won’t be until their late 20s), and the guys who are interested in relationships are those who are unattractive, and I don’t say this just to say that they’re ugly, but that they also haven’t quite developed into men who are sure of themselves, and likely won’t for several more years.

I just don’t know what to do, I’m feminine, kind, caring, pursuing a feminine career and I know that I am at least above average visually. I just can’t get the guy id been seeing off my mind, and it’s not like I’m head over heels for him; I’m scared that I will never be able to be with a man of his “caliber” unless it’s in a casual sex situation, and while I want to experience it I know that that just opens up a Pandora’s box that should remain closed.

deowuz,Checklist or Toolbox,"Hello class and welcome to RPW 101: Basic RPW. Where I will ramble about the foundations of this sub, what we are and are not and how we can use these tactics to achieve our goals. Class meets whenever I feel inclined to write and you can find the syllabus in the back of the book – by which I mean my head, good luck getting it out[.](http://symboliamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rose1.jpg)

###TradCon is RPW but RPW is not TradCon

Women tend to be consensus builders (more on the female social matrix in another class – take my word on this for now). Because of this, any group of women will tend towards homogeneity. The Red Pill has never been about a particular way of life, however, RPW slips into this mindset quite often.  It’s not rare to see someone discussing the “RPW Lifestyle” or “things an RPW would or would not do”. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is *problematic* (u/guywithgirlwithabike does not like the word problematic but it tickles me pink – expect to see it pop up again). 

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is that an “RPW Lifestyle” gives on the vague sense that there is checklist somewhere. If one were to find where on the darn sub we stashed the check list, she could follow it step by step, the heavens would part and she would be blessed with the most perfect blend of alpha-beta man that has ever walked the earth.  Now, I’ve seen a pared down version of the TradCon checklist (thanks Mom!). That checklist says: graduate from school, find a job, get married, have sex, buy a house, have a kid. The details of *how* are a bit fuzzy and I’ve never been one for checklist, still, it seems like a solid plan right? 

&amp;nbsp;

Well if I personally followed this plan, I’d have married my high school sweetheart. This is something that HSSH and I long ago agreed would have ended in divorce within five years of the marriage. I’ve never been good with checklists, they make me itchy.

&amp;nbsp;

Instead we call RP a *toolbox*. The challenge about toolboxes is that they contain tools. You have to know how to [use tools properly]( https://www.picclickimg.com/d/l400/pict/273521503919_/Vtg-The-Far-Side-Gary-LarsonMechanically-Declined-Graphic.jpg) or they don’t work. Further, you need to know which tool is the right tool for any given situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you are partnered up, it’s very easy to find the right tool. [Ask your man](https://redd.it/42ruyb). 

* Should you have long hair or short hair? *What does your man like?* 
* Should your closet contain dresses or jeans? *What is your man attracted to?* 
* Stay at home or go to work? *What works best for your relationship?* 

Cue the feminist outrage: “Your own preferences matter!!” they will shout. This is why the [no feminism](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/about/rules/) rule exists, it’s exhausting to put caveats on everything but caveat I will. *Of course* you should be comfortable with the decisions but if you have a strong preference *why are you asking the internet what you should do?* 

Oh, and if you ask your man’s opinion and he says to use a hammer, don’t insist that the screw driver is better. It will make him crazy and it’s, dare I say it, disrespectful. Ask me how I know.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for you single ladies the questions are a bit different. You should be asking: “what do *men* prefer” then “what do *the men I am attracted to* prefer” and “how limited will I be if I do this thing?”. 

An example: *I want to get a tattoo* - Now a lot of men might be turned off by tattoos so you might want to think twice. However, if your “type” is Mr. Rockabilly then you are probably not going to have an issue with that full sleeve you want to get.  It isn’t a problem to limit your options if your girl game is strong. Repeat after me: I don’t need to attract *all men*, just *the right man*. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are some [“tools” or strategies]( https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/wiki/index/tableofcontents/axioms) that will be consistent across all RPW. This is stated in the sidebar: 

&gt; We come from all different walks of life, so on RPW you will find harmonious and productive discussions between very religious traditional conservative women and hardcore BDSM submissives and everyone in between. **What we all share is not a lifestyle, a set of values, or a worldview, but a way of relating to men.**

The biggies are: understanding our own nature, understanding male preferences (and the  more nuanced – understanding *your* man’s preferences), submission, respect, sex. All these deserve their own rambling lecture so we’ll save them for another day while the baby naps.

&amp;nbsp;

Before we go, let’s talk about areas of disagreement. This is where the “RP is not TradCon” distinction really comes to light. There are a few topics that are guaranteed to rile up the base. Among these (non-exhaustive): monogamy or polyamory/open relationships, married v lifetime relationship, virginity and partner count. If RP was a checklist then there would be a concrete answer. Because it’s not, it is entirely possible to be a polyamorous woman, in a lifetime relationship who has a n-count in the double digits, and still practice RPW techniques and strategies. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I challenge you to start thinking about RPW in terms of interactions with men and about how *effective* something is as a strategy. We can still talk about where to get a cute 50s style dress if you like (I have an adorable one for our Christmas Tea Party), but that dress doesn’t make you an RPW, it just makes you a girl in a dress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/deowuz/checklist_or_toolbox/,1570478761.0,69,0.93,17,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

d9t2uv,(advice) How do I accept being in the passive role?,"I've always been attracted to guys who I have to chase. There's a recurring pattern that goes like this:
1. I like him
2. I get his attention
3. Everything going smooth
4. I start to fuck things up. I feel attachment towards him, convince myself I'm crazy and he would never feel the same way.
5. I start acting like a man. Initiating, leading, being the entertainer, doing favors, chasing him.
6. He takes what he can get cause why not?
7. He breaks it off and I become enraged because I feel taken for granted.

Now, to my credit, I recognized this pattern and stepped out of the dating world so I could fix myself. The thing is: 

I know I can't act boy crazy and desperate. In fact, I don't even want to. I have enough knowledge now to know that if a man wants you, you won't have to pursue him. Acting like the man repels men.

I've never had a serious boyfriend, never went on a real date, never had a guy seriously pursue me. I know why, because as SOON as I like a guy I already take the lead and go overboard. I haven't even had romantic feelings for any man after realizing this. Not to sound.. incel ish but for a while it felt like no man would ever love me as deep as I could love him. It still feels like that.

So, I'm still happy to be by myself and I know I'm not necessarily ready to jump back in the field. But the anxiety still eats at me. If I'm not 100% into the guy, I can't make it work. But, that makes me desperate and I end up in the pump and dump zone. How do I balance/correct this type of thinking? I don't WANT to be the man in the relationship, but I don't know how to just chill the fuck out and let shit happen. In my mind, if I don't take the reins, he won't and nothing will happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/d9t2uv/advice_how_do_i_accept_being_in_the_passive_role/,1569546298.0,60,0.9,35,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

Edit: off a suggestion to add more details. I am 26 years old, these guys are usually very alpha and chased by girls (but not always, I think even the others sister zone me), all seem to love spending time with me and want to be really close friends but are never clear about wanting to date me. And when they are, it usually fades after they get to know me.

d8fkt8,(NSFW) How do I get over feeling guilty about sex?,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not a tradcon but for a while I held myself to tradcon standards simply because I used to have this thing where I'd find any standard I couldn't meet and punish myself for not meeting it.

I was never crazy promiscuous, but I always tended to have a very intense and almost masculine view of sex. I've never had a serious boyfriend or went on a real date, but I've had a few hookups. In my mind I could make up for my insecurities about being ""undateable"" by cheating my way to the end- the end being sex. 

I recently (last april) went nun mode and completely celibate not because I was ready to practice being modest and trad- there was just something that made me want to stop fucking guys I wasn't emotionally attached to. But my problem is- I think I'm just not built to be a chaste woman until I meet my mr right. I'm not saying I want to hoe it up, but I can't even conceptualize what dating would be like without sex.

The reason why I stopped having sex is I stopped being stupid and realized I'm not ""winning"" anything by having mediocre car sex. I couldn't get any enjoyment out of interacting with men in any romantic/sexual way. I have actual PTSD from an unrelated event, and how I feel about sex is pretty similar to how I feel about those events. Every time I remember hanging out with a guy who I thought liked me, I can remember exactly when this feeling of dread would kick in. Like as he touched me, I realized ""he wouldn't be moving this fast if he thought you were girlfriend material. you lost."". 

This feeling of dread just follows me everywhere. It's all the more conflicting because I'm not prudish by any means. I'm not looking for a relationship now but if I were to find a guy that likes me and I like him I feel like I'd be at a standstill. If he's not sexually attracted to me and making moves on me (provided I'm attracted to him) I feel undesirable. If he IS sexually attracted to me, I couldn't feel like he REALLY liked me. 

I honestly wish I could still live in the delusion that having sex is empowering. I feel the exact fucking opposite, whenever I even think about myself as a sexual being I just feel powerless and disposable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/d8fkt8/nsfw_how_do_i_get_over_feeling_guilty_about_sex/,1569285178.0,67,0.87,29,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
d88s60,Taking the Effort to Dress More Feminine WORKS!,"A few weeks ago after discovering this sub, I sat down and went through my wardrobe. I typically have been pretty put together - several years ago I threw out all except five of my tshirts for sleeping/working out - but I took the time to determine what actually was my style and which outfits fit that while still being feminine, modest, and fun. I also figured out a pretty simple makeup/hair routine that only take \~10 minutes in the morning. 

Ever since I started doing this, many more people have made comments about how I seem put together and always look cute - from both men and women - and slightly more importantly, I've felt like I'm more put together, too. Having a face on and looking cute makes me feel better about myself. My emotions have been all over the place, but it encourages me to clean up my space and follow through on things I've avoided when feeling down before, like house cleaning and actually cooking (vs ordering out) and going for runs etc. etc.

d80rbu,"Liziqi, modern yet traditional feminine role model from China","I came across a video of Liziqi on r/simpleliving the other day and fell in love with her! She makes these gorgeous YouTube videos (\~6.5M subscribers) showing her traditional rural life on a homestead in China. She does everything with such feminine grace, I thought you ladies would appreciate her example of a modern feminine renaissance woman.

I wasn't sure which video to post so here's [Liziqi's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoC47do520os_4DBMEFGg4A), and here's [the video I first saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvmC-leoj9U&amp;t=25s) that got me hooked on her.

Her videos show such a range of homemaking talents...plenty of mouthwatering traditional Chinese recipes (her father was a chef), but she also makes her own makeup, designs/sews/embroiders her own dresses and shoes, builds her own furniture, even brews her own beer. She grows everything herself (from rice to silkworms) and makes everything from scratch using traditional (even ancient) Chinese methods (she builds with hand tools and her kitchen stove is wood burning).

People often think she is an actress on a set. But not only does she make everything in her videos herself (as her rough hands can attest to), she's her own filmmaker who directs, shoots and edits everything herself. She started out shooting and editing on an iPhone. In one video where she was making noodles, she had to keep remaking the noodles over and over again because they would dry out in the time it took her to set up each shot. Eventually she was able to buy a digital SLR and hire a cameraman (it was taking her 3-4 months per video), but she still directs all the shots and final edits herself. Her videos are so peaceful to watch and her production level is like something you'd find in a BBC documentary. I have so much respect for the dedication it takes to get that level of quality!

She's an example of a woman who is strong, independent yet totally feminine. All the comments are gushing about how any man would be honored to be with her. (Haven't come across anything about her romantic life other than the fact that she is single). Her backstory is like something from a Disney fairytale, complete with an evil stepmother before she was orphaned. She worked a hard life in the city, sleeping on park benches and working in everything from waitressing to DJing. When her grandfather died she returned to the country to care for her grandmother and started making videos to help sell her handmade products. And while she lives on a rural farm (in what most people would consider poverty conditions) everyone calls her a princess of China. She's my new woman-crush and has also inspired me to reconnect with my Chinese heritage.

d7mtdd,Youth obsessed,"Hello, long time lurker of both the RedPillWomen and RedPillMen. I’ve come here for a bit of a venting session. Some background: 

I followed the RedPillMen because in theory, I do align with some of their values. As a female who came from another country outside of the US (latina), I am fairly traditional and believe that certain roles should be played by certain genders. From there, I encountered this sub. 

This community has taught me so much. Y’all ladies are so freaking bad ass without losing sight of your femininity and that is hella inspirational. Having said that, it’s getting more and more disturbing to read the TheRedPillMen because so many of the discussions are so angry. Many of them truly do believe that women are incapable of love and that all we care about is what they can provide for us. 

Now, story time. I just came from the bar with my sister. I am 26 years old and not to brag but I am fairly good looking. I do attract lots of male attention. I enjoy this in a way but it makes me really uncomfortable when I’m hanging out with other girlfriends. My sister is about 43. She’s also very good looking. When she was younger, she was the prettiest girl in town. Now...not so much I guess?

I don’t like going out with her in these types of settings because it makes me even more uncomfortable than usual. See, I love this woman so much. She’s my best friend in the whole world. Tonight, I felt deeply sad that no guy really wanted to talk to her. It ruined my night. They all wanted to get to me. It was like she was invisible. But the must messed up part about this whole situation was that in the place that we were at, there was a Harvard reunion so there were a ton of suited old men. Don’t get me wrong, I can appreciate an older guy in a sharp suit. But appreciation is the extent of it. The fact that these guys just wanted to get with a 26 year old, some of them wearing their wedding rings, was absolutely repulsive. I have started to resent these men who only want me because I’m a shiny new object. In one occasion, I went to the bathroom and the guys almost immediately stopped talking to her. So gracious.

As a 43 year old woman, my sister looks for guys her age. Why can’t guys do the same? Because they have this obsession with youth, with the exterior. Not only am I so sad for my sister, who I’m pretty sure went home and cried herself to sleep, I’m sad for myself. I think about my future as a wife who will only have eyes for her equally mature husband, while his eyes wander and fantasize with the idea of a newer model. 

Throughout the night, apart from disgust, I just kept thinking how delusional they were to think that they have a chance with someone as young as me. I paralleled that with what I read on the RedPillMen. These guys really do believe that they don’t have a “shelf” life and that young women will be banging them even at their forties and fifties. Spoiler alert, when a young woman goes for an older man, she’s likely not in it for him, but for what he can offer financially.

d3u2oo,How to avoid branch swinging,"Hi lovelies,


Lately, I keep running across posts (on this subreddit and beyond) by women who claim they're in good relationships with good men, but are ""bored"" and not feeling it anymore and are considering breaking up/divorcing and I just felt like I had to say something about it.


Basically, this post is about the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance, and how we can consciously use that to our advantage.


There are some studies that show assuming a straighter posture will make you feel more confident. This is because your brain is trying to avoid cognitive dissonance (confusion) by finding reasons for why your posture is so dominant. ""Maybe it's because I'm a confident person,"" your brain thinks. There are studies that show that if you want an acquaintance to like you, you should ask them to do a favor for you, and not the other way around (you doing a favor for them). Their brain will try to avoid confusion by finding a reason for why they did a favor for you. ""I must like that person,"" their brain thinks.


I think a great deal of this can be extended to love, and I've felt it extend to love.


Some of you probably heard that story of a husband who wanted a divorce. His wife agrees but on the condition that he carries her into bed every day for a month. After the month, he finds that he fell in love again. Whether it's a true story or not, it resonates with a lot of people because it captures some truth about how emotions work.


**We don't have to be slaves to our emotions. We can gradually change and direct our emotions through conscious action. Our brains will find an emotional ""excuse"" for why we're performing certain actions.**


My own example: I've been with my partner for almost two years and love him as much as ever. But recently, I had some stresses with work and I mostly neglected cooking and noticed we didn't have sex for 3 or 4 days. This was just a week or two but around that time, I noticed that my feelings were waning ever so slightly. I was slightly annoyed at him for no reason, since he was behaving the same as usual. But, I was behaving differently. Fortunately, I knew what was going on so I consciously decided to take some time to make a nice meal and get myself in the mood to be really submissive and giving during sex. After that night - really as the night was progressing - I felt my emotions come back with a vengeance. It almost felt like I had I crush on him! I was giddy and excited.


So it's slightly sad that when the wife is unhappy in a marriage, she seems to look first at her husband. What is he not doing for me? Can't he be better? Sometimes a conversation is had and the husband makes a bunch of improvements which tragically only makes him love her more. Her feelings remain unchanged. Her feelings probably changed in the first place because she was putting in less effort than before. Feeling slightly disrespectful, then behaving disrespectfully, then feeling more disrespectful can spiral out of control. The solution is for the wife to consciously act in a respectful and loving manner, and be patient for her emotions to come around.


Don't get me wrong, if the husband is abusive or something, obviously don't do this. This post is specifically for the common case of ""my husband is such a great guy, I don't know why I'm so bored!"" And of course this theory doesn't only apply to women. If a husband starts losing interest in his wife, it may just be because somewhere along the way, he got comfortable and stopped putting in the work to please her. This is why some relationship books suggest that the wife always share her hopes with her husband, so he can have a chance to fulfill them.

d2bzm5,"Don't fall for ""natural"".","So someone asked how, if femininity was hard to achieve for some women, could it really be ""natural"".

Nothing we do in our lives is ""natural"". Natural is hunting and gathering. Natural is sleeping under a tree. Natural is being constantly pregnant between the ages of 11 and 35. Natural is dying in your thirties of rotten teeth. In short, natural, the way modern people use the word, is what happens if you don't do something to oppose entropy. 

So do not mistake natural for good, healthy, or desirable. 

You are not trying to live as you would in the natural state of humanity... you are trying to do far, far better than that. Doing far, far, better than that is why humans invented civilization and technology in the first place. We are trying to improve our lives over the state of ""natural"". 

When you shave your legs, you are not just imitating a young, healthy, high-estrogen girl's pale, fine, and less-visible leg hair... you are exaggerating it. When I lift heavy barbells, I am not simply imitating the effects of high natural testosterone, I am greatly exceeding them. A house built of timber and drywall isn't a substitute for a shade tree on the African savannah, or a cave... it is a vast improvement upon it. Willow bark is natural. Ibuprofen is not. Guess which one works better? 

The history of human civilization is nothing but the story of how humans tried to improve upon nature... and usually succeeded. This required effort. This required humans to leave their comfort zone, and do things they they had not tried before. This required the willingness to plan, try, fail, plan again, and try again. 

If you don't want to cultivate those things, then the notion that everything worth doing should be ""natural"" will seem very tempting. But this is just wishful thinking. If improvement were easy, it would not be considered improvement, because everyone would already have done it.

cydo1j,"29 year old woman and her ""Five year life plan""","Hello ladies (and gents)! I just discovered this wonderful subreddit a couple of days ago and ever since my eyes have been glued to the screen lol. 

I need your help and wisdom: I just turned 29 this year, and I am starting to get a bit worried...Since I've found RPW and after reading your post ""For Single Ladies late to the Red Pill"" I realized that **things need to change, now**. 

So three weeks ago I decided that I need to snap out of my victim mentality and start to take responsibility for my own life and actions. 

The facts: I'm 29, single, a virgin, a Christian. I'm quite picky when it comes to letting people into my life. I'm tall (5'10), blonde and a bit overweight (10 pounds) with an hourglass figure. My face is not ugly.  Also, I  have never been in a LTR up to now. Only was kissed by one guy I met on a Tinder date two years ago and that went nowhere. I only started going on dates when I was about 27 (I know I'm super late to the party!!!)I think deep down I feel like no good man will ever want me because my father made me feel like I was never wanted, appreciated or loved. So I became very independent and self-reliant.

I know that that is no excuse anymore, I'm a grown woman and need to get on with it. So I made a ""Five year life plan"" for myself. In five years from now, I 1. want to be happily married to a good captain, 2. be the mother of a healthy child, 3. live in a nice house/appartment in a nice(r) neighbourhood of my city and 4. have overcome all my deep-rooted insecurities.

In order to achieve these things (especially point 1) I know that I should always focus on what I am bringing to the table, how I could improve the life of a high value man. But mostly, I need to overcome my shyness and stop being so overly passive...it's hard! I can be extremely lazy and ""go with the flow"".

What do you guys think? Are these realistic goals? Is the time span appropriate or too long? I will be 34 in August 2024. Also, as I've never been heartbroken and literally nothing dramatic ever happended regarding past relationships, do you think I should still go into ""nun mode"" first? Is it always the first step? I don't plan on sleeping with a man before marriage.

cta1ja,"The Magic ""After-Work Conversation""","When he first comes home from work, your partner is at his most vulnerable.  How you handle this small window of time can have an enormous impact on your relationship. But it is often mishandled, making men feel drained and taken for granted. 

When we are waiting for our partners, our instinct is often to treat them as we would like to be treated. We make them the center of attention as soon as they walk in. In return, some men retreat or even get angry! ""I just need a few minutes."" ""Can't I have five minutes to myself?"" Whaaaat's going on? Why doesn't he appreciate coming home to a loving partner?!

The reason for this is simple: he needs to decompress. He needs to switch from ""work mode"" to ""home mode"". In order to do this, he needs to be able to stop thinking about work. 

We often think about several things at the same time.  However, most men prefer to work through one idea at a time. When he comes home from work, he may not be done thinking about all his ""work thoughts"". Until he sees those thoughts through to a logical conclusion or ending-point, they will nag at him. It's like trying to read a website with a big, neon popup flashing in the corner. He won't be able to be fully present, and he will find your bid for attention to be tiring rather than flattering. 

Instead of overwhelming him, allow him to come to you. Greet him warmly, then busy yourself with something while he decompresses. I find making my partner a warm drink and then reading is a great thing to busy myself with. Each man is different in his decompression activity and how long it takes - if you don't know what your partner's is, try to figure it out. My fiance likes to read the news on his phone. Maybe yours likes to go to the garage to tinker, or play with the dog. 

When he's decompressed, he'll approach you warmly. Only then should you initiate the ""after work conversation"" about how his day was. 

During this conversation, he may tumble out any last 'work thoughts' he can't resolve easily. Your job here is not to try to solve them (unless he explicitly asks for advice) but provide two gifts he cherishes. Fist, validate his concerns. Then, offer a small piece of admiration. Is he tired of the long hours needed to meet a deadline? Acknowledge that it must be exhausting and thank him for working so hard for your family. Or maybe he has an annoying coworker; it must be hard to get anything done with someone like that around but you're impressed by how well he handles that shit-slinging baboon of an accountant. This show of support is often the last thing he needs to get into ""home mode"". It flips the switch.   


He's in his haven now.

SO... What's your partner's after-work decompression ritual? What do you do to make this time a ""soft landing"" for him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cta1ja/the_magic_afterwork_conversation/,1566352423.0,284,0.98,46,RedPillWomen,HB3234
cqsxx7,Weight loss: why self-love might be more important than self-control,"I've been in nun mode for about a year, and while I've successfully found hobbies and begun to wear dresses and put on makeup and smile at strangers, I'm still 50lbs away from my goal weight. But three months ago, I started online therapy, and my therapist recently helped me realize something mindblowing about my weight loss journey that I want to share with you lovely ladies: **It isn't my lack of self control that's the problem. It's my lack of self-love.**

Even though I want to be in a loving relationship with a high value man, and even though I know I need to be slim and look healthy in order to achieve that, on a deeper level, I don't love myself enough to feel like I deserve those things. Because of past mistakes, mean comments from classmates, and years-old parental criticisms that I've internalized, I have a mean little voice in my head that says ""you deserve to be fat and miserable"" or ""you aren't good enough for anyone to love you"" or ""you don't deserve to be happy"" every time I try to better myself.  So, I self-sabotage every time I get close to achieving my goals.

Trying to diet and exercise away my weight is treating the symptom, not the disease, which is probably why I've been unsuccessfully yo-yo dieting since high school.

Now, instead of punishing my body with starvation diets and overzealous exercise programs (that don't work anyway), I'm working on being kinder to myself -- meditating in the morning, taking a walk in the sun on my lunch break, and listening to self-love affirmations during the day. I'm also doing my best to forgive my slip-ups instead of giving up and having to start over every Monday. It's a slower, longer process (and I still roll my eyes whenever I repeat ""I love myself"" after the calm, patient voice in my headphones) but it's helping. And I have faith that it will be worth it in the end.

Hopefully this helps you as much as it's helping me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cqsxx7/weight_loss_why_selflove_might_be_more_important/,1565889812.0,100,0.91,36,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

cmc074,I HATED “I hear you”.,"I have been rereading The Empowered Wife.  You know how an issue keeps popping up and it’s like “hey look at me! Take care of me now!”?  Maybe it’s just me.  So my husband comes home from his mom’s house and is so frustrated and he’s sharing his feelings and of course instead of just listening I have to jump in and take over and make it about me.  So we argue and he says “you know, all I hear is “shut up, don’t bring up anything. Ignore your emotions”.  I was taken aback and somewhere deep down I felt remorse, but my anger was still at the surface so I didn’t say anything - just kept my mouth shut. 

Fast forward, I’m taking a bath and rereading The Empowered Wife and what do you know?  She’s saying the exact same thing my husband said.  I’ve read it before, but man did it piss me off to read it again.  She says I don’t have to agree or disagree I just need to say, “I hear you”.  Ugh.  I wanted to yell at someone “it’s not fair!”.  Anyway.  I put on a smile and said, “I’m sorry for interrupting  you earlier and making it all about me. It was disrespectful.”  He didn’t say much.  But then he came to bed and shared all of these things with me he doesn’t normally share and I kept my mouth shut and said “I hear you”.  Or I did ask questions if I needed clarification (like “who is that again? Or where is your brother working now?” Type things.  

Keeping my mouth shut may be one of the hardest things ever for me... but I did it and it paid off (we had a nice talk and went to bed not angry with each other).

cjvw0p,No nagging is true respect,"My husband (age 28) and I (age 26) have always naturally had a 'red pill' relationship, however at times I have been prone to nagging.

But recently, I had this inner revelation that I in no way want to control my husband. I don't want to ever nag him or try to change his mind, and always want to just be truly honest and genuine. I believe that this is how I can show my husband true respect, and it feels as though everything is so much simpler.

Here are a couple of recent examples -

A few times a year since having children, we always have some tension around visiting my family. While they are polite to eachother, my husband doesn't really get on with much of my family (particularly my mum). Because of this, he understandably doesn't often want to go and visit them. With young children I don't feel confident doing the journey and visit alone, and he doesn't want me to either.
 
Usually I would keep going on about how much I want to visit, how we can make it work etc. But this time when he asked about visiting soon, I simply said something along the lines of ""I would really love to visit my family for the family gathering. If you think it would be possible with your work schedule and we can go, there is no obligation for you to join in with seeing everyone. If you don't think it will work, then I understand"". I truly meant it (no manipulation), and I left it at that.

He looked at how best to do things, and we are going (with no disagreements) which I'm really pleased about. When I thanked him; he told me that he will do the visit as he knows it will make me happy, but if he feels obliged to do something, it steals the joy of giving for him. I completely understand him.

The second example is about our children's bath time. Because of my husband's shift work - sometimes I bathe them, and other days he does. I wanted to do something a bit different in our routine, and where in the past I would have tried to convince my husband to do it the same as me, instead I simply just said ""I'm going to do bath time with the girls like this, because of this reason. I don't mind if when you do bath time you do it differently"". And again, I meant it. No hidden meaning.

He had obviously thought about it, and agrees with me about the change. This wasn't my intention, but I think just respecting him enough to let him decide how he wants to do things actually opened him up to re-evaluating how we do things.

I know that this is so simple and obvious to many people, but it's definitely something that I have had to learn. I'm looking forward to always continuing with this genuine and pure communication, with no hidden meanings or agenda.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cjvw0p/no_nagging_is_true_respect/,1564511256.0,165,0.96,23,RedPillWomen,Theflowerswillbloom
cj50y2,"How does a girlfriend behave differently than a wife in a relationship with a man, and how can a girlfriend be of value to him without giving away too much too soon?","Hello! 

I've been going down the rabbit hole of RP hardcore for the last few weeks, and really discovering what it means to embrace my femininity. I've also been listening to Helena Hart, Adrienne Everhart, and Pat Allen as a companion to this subreddit.

Putting these truths and strategies into practice is already working like magic to improve my life and my relationship. However, there are some things I'm still trying to grasp. I would love to hear some discussion on this:

Before a life long commitment has been made, what can you do as a girlfriend to nurture him without prematurely playing the wife-- or God forbid-- the mother? How do you show him your value as a partner and be ""wife material""? How can you make his life better with you then without you?

A big part of femininity is receiving and creating space to allow him to lead and come towards you, so where are the boundaries as a girlfriend? What's the line between being a burden by being too passive, vs. nurturing him, vs. overcompensating/over functioning for his approval? How do you build him up and affirm his masculinity, but not give too much of yourself in the process?

Tl;dr: I'm auditioning for a part as his First Mate and want to better understand how the behavior of a girlfriend differs from that of a wife.

I wonder if these questions are obvious, but I'm in the process of reinventing myself so it's honestly not clear to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cj50y2/how_does_a_girlfriend_behave_differently_than_a/,1564366918.0,105,0.94,59,RedPillWomen,dabadeedabadaa

chfcer,The Cheerleader vs The Soccer Mom and how to support your partner!,"Hello again sisters! :D 

Been having a couple thoughts about supporting men. And when I think hard about women I've met, women I know, ect, it truly feels like your average woman *fears* the choices her man will or wont make in life. She's concerned about what will happen if her husband doesnt come to her for direction, permission, or advice. Shes afraid of him allowing the kids to eat pizza and ice cream for 3 days straight when she goes to visit her mom. Shes concerned that if she's not there he'll add too much laundry detergent (instead of reading the instructions like an adult ) and screw up the machine. Shes concerned that if she doesn't *loudly* vocalize their financial need for him to get that promotion that'll give him an extra 15k a year, he just won't go for it because he rarely goes for anything. Shes afraid every day. She's rarely comfortable. She's waiting for the next disaster that she'll have to slave over. And deep down, she thinks hes kinda stupid. I'm sure you know someone that honestly thinks her husband is stupid!

Now. Who does that sound like? If you guessed a mommy with a rogue toddler, you're correct! Always vigilant, always terrified, always...NOSEY! 

So obviously our number 1 issue becomes picking the appropriate man because plenty of men have just never gotten off of the mothers nipple. They have no ambitions. They're meek and easily discouraged. They watch other men feast then rush in to grab at any scraps that are left. They inspire *fear* in a woman. We know this man is a red flag so I wanna skip ahead to when you've chosen the right partner but still have flickers of fear because I'm sure a lot of us have dealt with someone like that at some point. And of course everyone has to be introspective and question what about them attracted a meek, unambitious man. (Loud bossy mouth? Masculine attitude? Willing to be the manly woman of the house?)

And this is where the cheerleader vs soccer mom dichotomy comes in when you're in your happy relationship. And this has little to do with age, you can be a 19 year old soccer mom yelling at your bf to not be late for his shift and you can be a 40 year cheerleader that showers her man in compliments after he gets a great review at work.

The cheerleader, at her core, is cute, fun, lighthearted and encouraging. She bounces around, is *happy to be here*, and shes vocal with her support but quiets down once the match is on. She'll be right back out there with her pompoms when her man needs a pick me up and when he finally wins, she celebrates *him*. She doesnt celebrate the promotion, the review, or the boss that hired him. She celebrates *him.* She thanks him verbally and with action. ""You're so smart, baby!"" She rushes up to him and squeezes him and showers him in kisses. Yknow why? Because the cheerleader did her job and whether or not her team won, she did *her* job well. When the team is losing, the cheerleader doesn't rush out on the field to join the game! She knows that isnt her purpose! And most importantly of all, she *trusts* her man. A loss doesnt scare her because hes not a *loser.* He picks himself up, she assists in dusting him off, and right back out he goes. She's as supportive as he is reliable.

So our soccer mom is obviously the opposite of our cheerleader. Shes rough, she yells, shes scary, she chooses her mans goals for him because she doesnt think he has any common sense. At her core shes afraid, her self esteem is low, and she worries every night. She does not trust her man. She barely trusts herself. There is no encouragement, just shoving. When hes feeling down she berates him. If he wins, she *takes* the credit for it because she truly believes he wouldn't have wanted this if she didn't tell him to want it. ""Well yknow I'm the one that told him to go for the manager position in the first place!"" She also will skip over celebrating him to celebrate the win because she does not admire *him.* She admires the result of her nagging. ""Now we finally have enough money to go on vacation and get a new dryer!"" or ""Thank god Bill gave you the promotion over Harry!"" These are not compliments. They're damn near insults!

And just like a real life soccer mom situation, there is no moment to relax and bask in his accomplishment for the man, because the next game is on sunday. Soccer mom has already picked out her mans next goal. Nobodys happy. Mom always wants more, kid starts to hate both mom and soccer. 

So this is something I've noticed a lot of women struggle with. A womans trust is something super special and fragile, but if you logically know your man is worth it...butt out. Be a cheerleader. I had to learn how to shut up myself! Now if your mans decisions lead you to behave like a soccer mom out of fear for your own future and livelihood...is he really the man for you? And this dichotomy can be applied to a lot of issues. Alcohol, food, hygiene, sex, financial responsibility, ect. And ask yourself, ""Do I think he's kinda stupid?"" Be honest!

 If your mans unreliability scares you, hes not the one for you! But if you have a good man with a good head on his shoulders, trust him completely and without fear. And as always, if no one asked for your two cent, keep it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/chfcer/the_cheerleader_vs_the_soccer_mom_and_how_to/,1564008589.0,82,0.91,6,RedPillWomen,Cookiedoughspoon
chamai,Have you ever HAD to hang out with your husband’s ex girlfriend?,"We’ve been married for 6 weeks but together for almost 4 years. He dated his ex for 7 years, which was about 10 years ago, and broke up because she, understandably, wanted to get married and he knew he didn’t want to marry her. They have NEVER been friends since the break up. 

She is still friends with his friend’s wife and she is always trying to hang out with his group of friends. Out of respect for my husband and me, they never invite her when we all hang out. 

She also recently reconnected with my SIL, which feels like a huge boundary is being crossed, but whatever. I saw the Ex at a baby shower for his friend (it was women only) and she made snide remarks about the fact we were eloping. I told my husband (then fiancé) and he decided to block her on Facebook. His Ex went and told my SIL about being blocked and SIL called my husband to yell at him over it. 

Now she made sure to be invited to my husband’s friend’s surprise party by offering to host it at her house. Keep in mind that we celebrate this friend’s birthday ever year and she has never been invited (my husband has known him since 3rd grade). Of course my husband told his friends that we would not go if it’s at her house so they changed the location, and now for the first time in 4 years she is invited. 

I feel really uneasy about her after everything she has done. I get the vibe that she is pretty conniving and manipulative. I don’t know how to act and how to treat the whole thing. Am I just supposed to pretend her actions don’t bother me? After 4 years of knowing and loving husbands friends, I have never had to hang out with her. I don’t mind if it’s just this one time but I feel like she is desperately trying to become a permanent fixture in his friend group and that bothers me. I need advice!!

cgv0tj,"Introducing Chad Thundercock's Younger Brother, Dylan -- A Lady's Man for Our Modern Age","We at the Red Pill are all well acquainted with Chad Thundercock -- some of us (though it pains to admit it), intimately so. 

But less well known is his younger brother, Dylan. I was familiar with the person, but until recently, not the name... until    
[Guywithgirlwithabike](https://www.reddit.com/user/Guywithgirlwithabike/) was kind enough to tell me (they've known each other for years)! Now, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to Dylan Thundercock.

\*\*\*

Like his brother Chad, Dylan is very handsome... but unlike big bro, he seems so humble, not arrogant at all! He's even a little bit nerdy... he loves all the Lord of the Rings movies and he even cosplayed as Aragorn at the Ren Faire (teehee!). He was just totally shocked at how many women he was able to get out of their chemises by the end of the afternoon.

But Dylan doesn't *judge* them. In fact, whenever Chad calls women whores and sluts, Dylan is always quick to chide him and come to their defense. You see, Dylan is a feminist. He will never, ever think ill of a woman for having a high n-count (actually, he's not even familiar with that term, outside the realm of biostatistics, of course). He thinks women should be free to explore their sexuality with whomever and however they wish. Some of his closest friends are strippers... ahem, *sex workers*. He feels really bad for all those oppressed handmaidens, kept down by the cruel patriarchy, who will never know the liberating bliss of getting pounded by Dylan in his tent at Burning Man.

Dylan doesn't sleep around... he's polyamorous. He can't get it up for any woman with whom he doesn't have a deep emotional connection. I know you just met him, here at this dive bar where he just finished playing a set, but with one glance, Dylan can see into your soul. Don't you want to explore this inexplicably intense bond that you two share? Oh, he's moving too fast? That's OK, he'll wait until you're comfortable, when the stars align and the time is right. In the meantime, he's going home with Alexandra. Oh, you're jealous? He never imagined you could be so controlling; he thought you were so kind-hearted and open-minded! Why are you trying to *shame* Dylan, just because he has so much love to give?! 

Dylan listens intently and sympathetically as you malign your husband or your boyfriend. It's so terrible that your man doesn't immediately respond to your text messages when he's at work, while Dylan is always responding right away... even when Alexandra is right next to him in bed. Ah, Alexandra... she's such a strong, confident woman... so unlike all these hysterical, backward-thinking little girls with oppressive expectations of monogamy. 

Dylan will always be supportive of your dreams. He hasn't missed a *single one* of your burlesque performances! And isn't it great how, unlike Chad (who only dates cheerleaders and Victoria Secret models), he doesn't have these societally-manufactured expectations of beauty? Dylan loves women of all shapes and sizes... so long as they are bent over the hood of his classic Mustang.

Of course, Dylan would never ask you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. He knows your happiness is the most important thing in the world, after all. But wasn't it Mother Theresa who said that suffering brings us closer to God? With that in mind, won't you try anal, just this once?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cgv0tj/introducing_chad_thundercocks_younger_brother/,1563900159.0,159,0.89,92,RedPillWomen,RubyWooToo
cejwjx,Miscarriage,"I miscarried my third baby last Monday. It was one of the most horrific, gruesome, gory, just absolutely awful experiences of my life. I woke up the morning it happened with a feeling of dread in my stomach. I felt panicked and like I couldn’t deal with anything. Felt like a such a loser wimp but went ahead and called my mom and asked her to get the kids and keep them for a few days. I’m so glad I did. It would have been awful if my kids had been home. 

I’m shocked by how horrible it was. I don’t mean any disrespect to people who have seen violent crime, but I do feel like I had to watch someone get beheaded. It seemed like more than watching a beheading. I had to watch and be part of it and then deal with the broken pieces of the dismembered person. It was just... horrible. My kids would have been scared out of their minds, because I was screaming and sobbing uncontrollably. The blood and gore, plus the knowledge that I was looking at pieces of my child was just too much to handle quietly.

My mind is blown that this is a “common medical issue.” I know so many women who have lost two, three, even seven children, and some of them were technically stillborns, and not miscarriages. It’s such a grim thing. My husband had been very supportive, but he did make one comment late one night that I should stop talking about it and move on. I don’t know if he really gets it. The thought’s been sticking in my throat. I’m scared of the thought of ever having sex again, since my lady parts seem like a death tomb and it’s hard to imagine them being a source if intimacy or pleasure, or even of new life. 

Is this a first world problem? I’m so sad. I feel like a hungry thief snatching at all the signs that the pregnancy exisited. I wanted my baby. I’m so sad that the relationship with this baby is over so soon. I don’t blame myself - I really believe that my body acted as an impartial Mother Nature and rejected the baby because it had a bad abnormality. I’m still so sad though. Am I unreasonable for feeling so deeply lonely? All my food adversions have just disappeared. No pregnancy nausea or tiredness or anything. Some water weight is still floating around. I’m still bleeding from the miscarriage. I’m happy to have my two sons, but I miss the other baby that didn’t make it. I feel even more strongly that life is worth all the grim and blood and death. 

But I am just so so sad about my little baby. I wanted him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cejwjx/miscarriage/,1563402588.0,150,0.94,46,RedPillWomen,mrssmithhh
cb4xjb,STFU in Practice,"STFU (shut the fuck up) is probably one of the most misunderstood pieces of advice I see here. It seems like once a month I read the following:

*My husband has been out of work for the last 18 months, since he was fired from the Dog Food Factory. Initially, he was really depressed, so he'd spend his days playing video games and complaining about how unjust the whole thing was... except that it really wasn't. He called in sick all the time, because he didn't feel like going to work, since he hated his boss. I didn't want to say anything, because I read RPW and know the importance of STFU, so I trusted him to be responsible... but he wasn't. After a few months of video games and moping, I assumed he'd start putting in job applications and going on interviews, especially since I was working double shifts with our first baby on the way. Now it's been a year and a half of being the dutiful and faithful wife. I encourage him and spoil him, even though I'm exhausted from new motherhood and 60 hour work weeks, but he won't put in any applications! I'm trying so hard to keep my mouth shut, but I'm not sure how long I can go on like this!*

STFU is not a directive to be a doormat. It's a sign of trust and respect, both of which are *earned and reciprocal*. If your husband is intentionally sabotaging his current job or has been unemployed for an extended period of time, without looking for new work, he's not respecting you as his wife or himself as the leader of your household. He's abusing your trust and loyalty. A similar situation:

*My boyfriend and I have been living together for five years. When we moved in, the plan was to get engaged within a year and married within two. We were both on board with this and excited about it. However, my boyfriend hasn't mentioned engagement since shortly after we signed the lease. I've been reading RPW and I know I should continue to STFU, but it's been* ***five years*** *and I'm about to turn 28! I'm not sure if anything will ever change, if I don't speak up.*

While the above boyfriend isn't neglecting his family, he is disregarding the goals and the plans you made together. He's disrespecting the parameters he set *with you* and wasting your time if he's changed his mind without saying so. In both situations, you're completely within your rights to *speak up,* because you're strongly impacted. STFU isn't intended to reward steamrolling or abusive behavior. It's a method of respectfully placing your trust in your partner. So what *does* it look like?

A few months ago, my husband and I were expected to go to dinner with his supervisor... who he *hates* and still thinks is a moron. I didn't want to go, because I know he finds the man insufferable, but the supervisor was paying and being really pushy about it, so my husband made it clear he'd be pretty upset if I refused to go. Day of, we were running errands and lost track of time. I didn't have time to go home and change, even though I didn't feel dressed for a restaurant. My husband thought I looked fine, so I decided to STFU. Dinner was awkward, but bearable, until it came time to pay and the supervisor asked for separate checks. Wait. What? I thought he was paying! I looked to my husband for some sign that this was unexpected and saw nothing. He seemed totally fine with picking up our check. Earlier in the day, he'd told me he wanted me to wait on a purchase, because we didn't really have the money, but he could pay for a dinner neither of us wanted, when he promised it was on the supervisor?!?

But wait... I trust my husband. I know he's not a pushover and supervisor or not, he would not have just taken that hit, when he didn't even want to go to the stupid dinner. There must have been something more to this. So, I decided to STFU. When we got to car, I calmly asked ""Did we pay for that or...?"" to which my husband explained that his supervisor had given him and his coworker cash, so they could order what they liked and not have to worry about going over some limit.

Consider the alternative. Instead of accepting that my husband didn't care that I wasn't dressed to impress, I throw a fit and insist on going home to change. By the time we get home, it's too late to go to dinner at all, my husband has to cancel with his supervisor, and he's pissed, because he'll never hear the end of it. Perhaps I *do* keep my mouth shut over my attire, but the check is the last straw. Instead of trusting my husband to handle it, I blurt out ""I thought he was paying,"" to which I get the same explanation, but I sound ungrateful to the man who bought us dinner and embarrass my husband and he's pissed, because he'll never hear the end of it. Instead, STFU saved the day, because *I trust my husband*, who has *earned my trust.*

While I've outlined a daily interaction, STFU has long term applications as well. The supervisor my husband hated? I was always worried that he'd do something to get my husband fired. He was constantly pinning things on my husband and taking credit for his work. He spread rumors about everyone and bad-mouthed my husband to upper management. He kept him from getting a promotion and multiple people thought it was because he was threatened by him. I vetted well, however, and married a man who had been very successful in the oil field, something that only happens if you know how to play the game. When he'd vent, I'd occasionally ask if he'd mentioned some of these concerns to upper management and sometimes he did, but I was careful not to nag. The culture of my job is *vastly* different than his. I had to trust that he knew what he was doing, despite my fears that this idiot supervisor was going to screw him over. It's a good ol' boys' game and my husband is the best good ol' boy of them all, so I STFU.

Three months ago, upper management called my husband into the office to talk about his supervisor and some issues they were having with him. My husband told them, without exaggeration or feeling, some of his problems. He left the office with a promotion to crew chief of another department, proving that my trust in him is earned... and sometimes so is my silence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/cb4xjb/stfu_in_practice/,1562697670.0,214,0.97,16,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

c7otw1,Just wanted to share some happy developments from a crabby gf!!,"Sooooo in my relationship Ive been kinda crabby. Some whinyness, prone to silence and being cold when I'm upset. And that's gross. My bf is so very patient and sweet. Literally the personality of a golden retriever. Just sweetness wrapped up in beauty. 

So he's training for work and asked me to come see him for a 3 day weekend. His family was also visiting him so we were sharing him over the 3 days for the most part. And honestly, the trip wasnt perfect but *he* was perfect and I think I'm finally making that distinction. So I wanted to tell you guys how I altered my behavior for certain situations.

1- I invited him to take a walk with me while we were at his family's party. He's a relatively quiet dude and I think I would typically just have stayed yapping with his family, which of course is fine but I wanted to focus on *him* more. So I politely asked if he'd like to take a walk with me and he looked surprised and said of course. We went on our walk holding hands the whole time while he showed me things in the neighborhood. I got emotional at a certain point because I missed him so much so typically I wouldve caved in inwards with silence but i forced it out and cried to him. That I missed him so much and  I just loved him so much. And let me tell you, he held me like I was made of glass and honestly I felt like I was. Then I made us stop to look at a bunny in a bush and a cool beetle on the ground. He just stood there smiling at me while I crouched and tried to communicate with the bunny. 😂 That was an exercise in childlikeness! We stayed out on our walk until his parents called him because they were getting ready for bed at midnight.


2- He was supposed to come to my hotel at a certain time but was late from dropping his family off at the airport and traffic. I had already felt an attitude bubbling because I have had issues with patience. My texts were a little short and he asked me if something was wrong. I redirected my energy and said no and asked him how he was doing instead of voicing my frustration. I let him tell me he was upset because he just wanted to see me. I was still a bit frustrated but once he got to me I held him and told him to get in the bed. Then I redirected that frustration in a way that made us both happy 😂 I can't get mad at him being late because he was fulfilling his obligations to his parents! Airports are just finnicky! We cuddled afterwards and he told me nothing feels better than laying in bed with me.

3- he told me he had a blister on his foot and I think before I would've just been like well you need better shoes. But I told him to let me see his feet and I held them and actually drained it!! Gross. But he was thanking me and giving me forehead kisses so I didn't mind. I'm happy I could alleviate his pain with action instead of telling him something he knows. Duh, you know you need better shoes if these give you blisters.

4- He had taken me and his family out to dinner and the cuisine basically included shrimps with head on. After he got rid of my shrimps heads for me he started teasing me with the severed head (I know 😂)  but I just giggled and acted scared because I kinda was but not like a horrified scream and yelling, like a shocked ""baby, why?!"" Kinda situation. His family laughed and teased us. It was immature but like, why not? Why can't a man tease his woman for 30 seconds? Fun is fun is fun. I'm glad we're still lighthearted and if a shrimp head keeps us playful I can deal with that!


So that was my trip and the ways I've tried to become a better woman for him. I'm trying to put my emotions out more because I have a habit of keeping it in and shutting down. He loves when I laugh until I snort and I think it's wrong of me to not try my hardest to make sure he gets snorts often lol. I'm happy I'm finally finding a way to deliver even negative emotions in a sweet way. In a way that makes him want to keep me safe and happy and precious!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/c7otw1/just_wanted_to_share_some_happy_developments_from/,1561960396.0,97,0.95,8,RedPillWomen,Cookiedoughspoon

c2mk3b,I Put On A Dress Today,"
It’s a new dress that I bought from ModCloth. It’s short sleeved, A-Line, and plaid with muted rainbow colors. Wine, Rust, Smokey Blues, and Grey. 

The skirt really makes my imperfect waist look quite lovely. And for all the muted colors in the dress it makes my red hair really sparkle. 

So today I curled my hair, cowashing first, then scrunching in the mousse and letting my hair plop. All that stuff I learned on the curlygirl subreddit. It looks quite fresh and shiny and healthy now that it’s dry.

Then today I put on lotion. All across my smooth legs and arms. I did my whole skin care routine, sunscreen on the top. Then I put on pink lipstick, mascara, perfume, and pearls for jewelry. Even a light bracelet. 

My navy blue wedges have a four inch heel and I look like I don’t have care in the world. 

But now I feel better. I can see my fresh face. I can see my figure that I really put so much effort into. I can smell the perfume. I feel better. 

I don’t always wake up in a good mood. I don’t always wake up bright and ready to face the day. But a little self care and a fun dress can really help me get out of my head and back into a better mood.

c16l1d,Making my husband's lunch,"Over this past few months, I began making my husband's lunch to take to work each day. Before, I often did it, but not every day like I am now. And honestly, I had no idea how much something so simple would mean to him.

As a SAHM I do everything around the house (cooking, cleaning etc.),  that I would have never imagined a job that takes me five minutes would make my husband so happy. I don't do anything too complicated - leftovers or a nice sandwich and fruit, and usually some homemade cake or a cookie baked with our toddler.

But it really is something that he's so thankful for. Apparently his work mates always think he has the best lunches and he likes telling them I made it for him. It's also a nice little reminder of me when he works long, hard shifts.

bvo6pn,Becoming Red Pill as an Older Woman,"I took the red pill somewhat later in life -- just in my early 50s -- and now, at 55, have been widowed for three years and am still raising my 19 and 14-year-old daughters. I'd initially accepted (due to reading and learning the manosphere perspective) that my SMV was a thing of the past and decided to enjoy friendships and interesting conversations with men and leave it at that, as I have plenty on my plate as a widowed mother of two.

Then, within the last six months or so, I began slimming down considerably without even trying (due to learning my younger daughter was prediabetic and making major changes in our eating habits and exercising more), and I started feeling an overwhelming desire to find a man whom I could be a real help, comfort, and support to in all the ways that a woman should serve a man, including sexually. I also feel a strong desire for my girls to see me in a truly happy and joyful relationship with a man; I think this may help them rethink the feminism that they're currently embracing.

I understand that just because I feel the desire, this doesn't mean I'm entitled to a man, so I've just been praying about it and continuing to work on myself and endeavoring to be as in-shape and pretty as I can be in my advanced years. We've also moved and, as of one month ago, have been sharing a house owned by my brother with one of his best friends -- a man just three years older than me. My brother had suggested that his friend and I, both having small incomes, could each live more comfortably and make ends meet more easily if we shared a home, and he felt that we were two people who could get along well as roommates.

It's been working out well so far, and in the process of getting to know one another, I've become strongly attracted to this man. I understand that wearing my heart on my sleeve would make things enormously awkward if he doesn't end up feeling the same way. And also that rushing into anything would be a huge mistake, especially as I'm a mother and have to set an example for my daughters and put their wellbeing first.

So I'm just prayerfully learning about this man's perspective on so many things pertaining to life and relationships. He's not at all a feminist, and has pretty openly volunteered information about some things he does and doesn't find attractive in women. He's also shared that his last girlfriend was 16 years younger than him, and is unashamedly open about his preference for hot young women -- which I concede is perfectly natural, as the male sex drive is largely about the man ensuring his immortality by mating with the youngest, most fertile and beautiful women he can get; even if a man has no desire mentally to father more children, a young, fertile woman is still what his body is craving and is naturally what he's most attracted to.

So I've decided that since I feel he's worthy of all my efforts -- he's worth it even with the risk of him never wanting me that way -- I'm just continuing to focus on improving myself and being a good friend to him. When he first moved in (after we'd been here about a month and a half) and I offered him foods I'd prepared, he said we could each fend for ourselves, and I said that was fine but he was always welcome to anything in the fridge (he doesn't enjoy cooking). I even commented that I'd missed having a man to cook and do little things for (trying to just be matter-of-fact and not forward), and he has quickly become comfortable with eating my cooking and seems to enjoy it, and also comfortable with letting me wait on him, bring him a cup of coffee, and so on. 

So I've decided to look at this as a win-win situation for me. It's certainly a win if he ever returns my feelings, although if he ever brings it up, I'll need to tell him that the only man I've been with sexually was my husband, and that for me, sex is two people becoming one, so whether or not there's ever a piece of paper, in my heart, it would essentially be a marriage. So he shouldn't get involved with me without really wanting that kind of relationship himself.

At the same time, it's also a win even if he never returns my feelings, because just receiving his occasional appreciative glance or comment is really motivating me to watch what I eat and keep up my daily hula hooping routine, as well as be attentive to my personal grooming at all times. So I'll be a healthier and better woman just through knowing him.

Just starting this thread for advice (male advice is also quite welcome if any man happens to read this) and to encourage others to share their stories. I may be the oldest woman reading/posting here, but if there are other women like me who saw the light after ""hitting the wall,"" I hope you'll feel welcome to chime in and know you're not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bvo6pn/becoming_red_pill_as_an_older_woman/,1559415371.0,65,0.96,25,RedPillWomen,That_Susan

brcrks,When It's Not an Ultimatum,"I'm going to share two stories of two very different women, who *did not* give ultimatums.

I met Jenny when we were 14. Even at this age, as a young feminist and future career woman, she didn't want children. Everyone told her she'd change her mind. At 16, she didn't want children. At 20, she didn't want children. At 22, she fell in love with a man 10 years her senior, Dave, and told him clearly that she didn't want children. At some point, however, Dave decided that he *did* want children and that Jenny would eventually change her mind. Jenny entered academia, where she grew into an even more liberal feminist and unsurprisingly, *did not want children,* a life choice that was very much supported by her environment. Ultimately, she told Dave that under no circumstances was she ever willing to have children. He walked and she let him. She never changed her mind and, last I heard, had met a man with similar goals and was pursuing her PhD.

I met Sally when I was working at a movie theater in college. She was pretty, slender, smart, and was dating another employee, Cody. Cody was good looking, confident, funny, social, ambitious, and often a complete asshole. They both came from good families and had been dating for nearly a year, at 19. I don't recall if they intentionally followed each other to college or met there, but just from the oversharing young people do, I knew that Cody had been Sally's second partner and she had been his first. Love was in the air and they both assumed that, after college, they would eventually get married.

Although Sally wanted a career, even then, she *knew* she wanted to be a doting wife and mother. At 19, Cody seemed game for the former, but less interested in the latter. Finally, he told Sally that he didn't want kids... and she immediately ended it with him. She told him she loved him, but that she was not willing to spend her youth on a man who wouldn't *eventually* want children. She *had* to know that if they married, children would be in their future. She didn't throw a fit or demand promises. She walked... and he didn't let her. A few months passed and Cody thought it over, consulted friends and family, and decided that he would *eventually* want children. He genuinely loved Sally... and she did not immediately take him back. Unsurprisingly, she felt that he'd only given in to an ultimatum she didn't intend to give. I don't know what Cody did or said to make her feel differently, but in time, they did get back together. Last I heard, they're happily married and on baby number two.

A tale of two *women,* the men's decisions are irrelevant. These women, however different, both vetted carefully, at a young age, for a man with common goals. Upon discovering that their choices weren't consistent with where they wanted to go in life, they set aside their feelings and walked. Ultimatums are *always* a terrible idea and neither of these women gave one. They calmly and rationally stated their deal breakers and took a future they didn't want off the table, accepting the consequences. One found herself single and the other found her man had a change of heart. The difference here is that Jenny had *endless* years to find a man who didn't want children, especially in her environment, while Sally had only a handful, making it all the more important for Sally to vet with her endgame in mind.

For all the women here who find themselves considering giving an ultimatum or even waiting him out, I'd advise you to rethink. Consider what you want from life and vet accordingly. If he tells you he sees a different future than you do, walk... not so he'll run after you, but to free yourself up for someone with a similar vision. There are many, many wonderful men out there and the earlier you begin vetting well, the better chance you'll have of landing one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/brcrks/when_its_not_an_ultimatum/,1558457359.0,115,0.97,11,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

bqhocz,How RPG helped me become a better woman,"Let me start off by saying that I am somewhat unconventional for this sub.

I didn't really start to seriously want a committed relationship and  family with children until I was about 26. My n-count is not low, and I enjoyed short-term and casual relationships in my early twenties. I also happen to have a very high libido and other somewhat masculine traits, like high ambition and high intellectual curiosity. Despite this, I was nowhere near emotionally ready to have a mature relationship with a man and I was deathly afraid of real connection and committment.

I moved to East Asia at 19 having no cultural or ethnic ties to the region simply to learn the language and experience another country. I was also quite nerdy and enjoyed debate and critical analysis on a variety of topics. I got highly educated and am learning how to code to bring it to the next level. I was a successful, interesting, free-spirited woman who couldn't get a man to commit to her.

I was also, of course, a feminist, reblogging feminist memes on Tumblr and in general being pretty angry at the world and having a low opinion of men.

I started reading TRP and later RPW when I was around 26, and it changed my perspective of the world.

It wasn't instantaneous, and it took many years of reflection, living life, and debate with friends to reconcile what I had learned with my lived reality, my personality, and my biological realities.

I learned to accept that men and women *are* scientifically different, and there is no point in trying to deny it. It makes no logical sense, with all knowledge we have on the way hormones affect everything from your physiology to your personality, that men and women with such bodies should function the exact same way. From there on, RPW opened me up to become the woman I am today.

I am still unconventional. At 31, I just now met a man that I fully want to commit to, think is a good match for me, and is as into me as I am into him. RPW has helped in giving me the confidence that I can be a good mate to him: it taught me that it is not weak and stupid to want to provide for your man. Stomach full and balls empty are the basics, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Luckily he is a very giving, caring person who also genuinely enjoys pampering me in turn. I use my feminine charms to delight him and make him express his masculinity, and I don't care anymore if anyone thinks that's sexist.

I learned that sexual loyalty is very, very important, and that women should not have casual sex to express their independence when it is jeapordizing what they really want. Our relationship was LDR for a brief moment and we weren't an official couple yet, so it would've been okay for me to go on dates and sleep with other men ""in the interim."" I chose not to. It was absolutely the right decision, and he is appreciates my restraint and investment in us. I've been very honest with him about my past and he is okay with it; we both run in liberal, very left circles so he's used to ""strong women owning their sexuality."" But he appreciates even more that I now feel that my sexualiy should be for him only.

I am happier than I could have ever been, and wanted to say my thanks to the community. I am not like many of you who figured out they wanted marriage and children in their teens or early twenties and made it happen. I admire the fact you were mature enough at that age and that you already knew what you wanted; I was absolutely a lost child in my early 20s.

So once again, thank you, RPW. There's so much value here for women who didn't follow the SAHM route. The principles remain the same and for me, it has made my life and my relationship immeasurably better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bqhocz/how_rpg_helped_me_become_a_better_woman/,1558276891.0,84,0.88,10,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

bn28vq,Present Over Perfect: when it comes to the food on the table,"I was listening to a podcast the other day, and the woman mentioned a book called Present Over Perfect. I haven’t read it, but I loved the concept, and have been thinking about the idea ever since and how to implement it in my own life, as I can tend toward perfectionism in my journey of self-improvement and in working towards being the best woman, and future wife and homemaker I can be. 

I don’t think I’m alone in this trait among the women of RPW. Naturally, we are perfection seekers, and work diligently on ourselves and our relationships and marriages. I specifically am a perfectionist when it comes to food. I take pride in my cooking, and have taken on excessive feats in the past, whether I’m making an extravagant steak dinner for my man, cooking for the family at the holidays, or hosting a large party. No matter how well things go, I can tend to be overly critical of myself, especially when things fall short. And I’ll be the first to admit that things fall short (or fall apart) often in the kitchen and at the table. 

I’ve killed the yeast in my homemade dinner rolls for Christmas dinner. I’ve served tirami-soup instead of tiramisu due to under-whipped cream and a not-fully-cooled sabayon. I’ve flipped a chicken pot pie over as it was coming out of the oven, ruining a beautiful puff pastry top and killing presentation. I’ve served filet mignon that I forgot to salt, and rushed it back to the kitchen to correct it after the first bite during a romantic dinner. I’ve ran out of green beans at a big party before the buffet line finished through. I’ve accidentally used garlic salt instead of garlic powder on garlic bread and was mortified at the first bite, and again, ran back to the kitchen to pop a few new pieces under the broiler. I’ve burnt the breadcrumb tops of stuffed tomatoes, and burnt my belly on the handle of my cast iron pan right out of a hot oven. I’ve had souffles collapse. I’ve undercooked brats on a camping trip. I’ve stared down cheesecakes as they cool, praying they won’t crack. I can be downright pouty when these slip-ups happen, and even when everything goes right, I desperately search the faces of those I’m serving for affirmation that they’re satisfied with whatever I’ve made, and repeatedly apologize if things aren’t the way they should be. Sound familiar anyone?

I was brainstorming ideas for a romantic dinner with my sister and her boyfriend a few months back, and I asked the boyfriend for advice on the menu. He told me it doesn’t matter what I make, and that I shouldn’t take on anything that will make me stressed out. That if I’m enjoying myself, he will too. I think he’s been a witness to my perfectionism in the kitchen, and gave me wonderful insight that I can sometimes sacrifice my feminine disposition in the pursuit of a perfect meal. Which is totally missing the point!

I have been working on this since, and the concept of Present Over Perfect is a beautiful and succinct way to summarize my pursuit. I have worked to cultivate a more serene presence in the kitchen and at the table, and to have a sense of lighthearted humor when things don’t turn out the way I expect. 

We don’t cook meals for perfection’s sake. We cook meals to bring together those we love, as an act of service, to nourish our bodies and those around us, to bring joy to the table. Cooking is an expression of love itself, and is an artform that doesn’t demand perfection. A poor attitude can ruin the experience for everyone. Be present at the table. Enjoy the company of those you love. Allow the food to add to the experience of togetherness, instead of being a source of stress and fret and disappointment. Learn from mistakes, correct them if you can, but do so with a smile, a pinch of grace, and a dash of gratitude. 

Whatever you make tonight, be present at your table.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bn28vq/present_over_perfect_when_it_comes_to_the_food_on/,1557514695.0,58,0.93,8,RedPillWomen,kittxxn

blgszv,"I'm not where I want to be, nowhere near, but I'm getting there.","Hey ladies, it's been a while since I've posted but I have been on the chat from time to time, you've all given me a lot of tough love and I needed it. so, thank you. 

I won't go in about my story or my heartbreak, but I met a man at 19, he was married and it broke me entirely.. I walked away after suffering from depression, low self-esteem, humiliation, and shame. I met another man at 21, he was my world, I fell so in love, so fast..  I didn't even know what was happening to me. Problem was, He was my married man's best friend, so naturally, we turned into a catastrophe, we broke up 1 year later. (To get a little back story you can read my posts).

So,  it's been 1 year, and 1 month since we broke up, I still cry some days, fewer days now.. to be honest, I haven't cried since he told me she was pregnant (1 month ago). I had a quick reminder of how low I felt when I was having an affair and was dealing with the depression from it. I cried, I cried so hard I thought my heart and my lungs would shut down. I cried so hard I thought I was going to die. I was completely defeated. I wasn't crying because she was pregnant with his baby (of course that's what I thought at the moment), it took me a 3-hour therapy session the day after he told me and 4 days to realize I was crying over loss  - the  loss of him, but most importantly the loss of the life I imagined we'd once have... the life I so desperately wanted - marriage, and parenthood.. and he was going to have it now, with someone else. That same day I deleted his number, his mom's, sister's, step-dad's, step-brother's... everyone. I got rid of the pictures on my phone, the pictures on social media, the text message threads, I boxed up the jewelry, I boxed up the clothes. I haven't cried since. My aunt (very superstitious) always told me to pray to the moon for love, I used to pray to the moon during my depression and my affair ..  and so I waited for the moon and I prayed, and although she wasn't very kind to me the first time, this time I didn't ask the moon for him and I. I simply prayed she'd get me through it, I prayed she'd heal my heart, maybe it's crazy but I was desperate. I don't know if I'm in denial, maybe I am, but I haven't cried since that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have completely submerged myself in school, pledged nun-mode, working doubles, working on my health, getting my eczema and breakouts under control (my skin is like porcelain and it's looking the best it ever has), I stopped checking his social media, I even booked a vacation to Thailand (""eat, pray, love"" kinda thing), and going out with my older brother and his co-workers/friends. I've been going to therapy every week, I have goals set up, some are tough to follow thru with.. I'm supposed to get rid of his family on social media... that's proven to be the hardest thing for me (I don't want to be forgotten by them, especially his mom, I loved her) but my therapist says it's a necessary step to breaking off the chains and feeling free. I've been going out every weekend and I've felt so happy hanging out with my brother, dancing, and smiling, but I'm deathly afraid that this is a ""phase"" and I'll break down, maybe I'm wrong - I hope I am. I want to be happy and the ""high"" I feel every weekend is helping me get through. I am distracted.

&amp;#x200B;

I am smiling again you guys, I am dressing up and getting pretty... I am even dressing up for work again. 

I'm not where I want to be, nowhere near, but I'm getting there. 

Thank you for the tough love; Thank you for the words of encouragement.

bg2taf,It’s wild how much cooking changes the dynamic,"This isn’t exactly a shocking revelation, but I love seeing it in action. My fiancé works a job that normally feeds him three meals a day, and during mealtimes he and his coworkers are usually wrapped up in discussing ‘business.’ I prefer to cook for myself and I have a long commute, so I usually go to the gym/run errands after work and don’t eat dinner with him—we hang out afterward.

This past weekend, like most holiday weekends, his job wasn’t feeding him. So I cooked. Yesterday after church (Easter), I did vanilla cinnamon brioche French toast (his favorite) with syrup and fresh berries plus an egg scramble with peppers, onion, and chicken chorizo. Dinner was rosemary steak tips, garlic-rub pork loin, green beans,  Brussels sprouts, and of course wine. Chocolate truffle brownies for dessert. Not fancy, all quick to prepare, but it’s amazing how much better cooking seems to make things. It makes him talk more about growing up and his childhood. He loves to come hug me from behind/grab my butt in the kitchen. The sex is better. And this is with a guy who is pretty ‘purple pill’ as things go (his mom was stay at home and I consider him very masculine, but he also thinks a woman with a career is sexy; he likes women who dress modestly but powerfully. Think Michelle Obama).

I’ve been kind of nervous about cooking every night when we move next year, when I start law school and he starts a new job that doesn’t feed him. But if cooking improves our domestic vibe this much generally... well, then I guess it’s time to add a crockpot and more pans to the registry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bg2taf/its_wild_how_much_cooking_changes_the_dynamic/,1555943715.0,115,0.92,14,RedPillWomen,lawschoolRP
bfj2l2,Apparently knowing how to cook and sew is odd to my Coworkers,"I work as a CNA for a company that provides 24 hour care to the intellectually disabled within their own homes, which includes things like making meals and doing laundry and other  services.

Today I noticed a hole in a client’s fitted sheet while making her bed, so I remarked to my coworker that I would have to bring in my sewing kit tomorrow and stitch it up. My coworker (female) was completely astounded that I knew how to sew, and proceeded to make a few snarky comments over the course of our shift about me being a “50’s housewife”.  I also made a pot roast and a cake, since tomorrow is Easter and I want my clients to have a treat, and both of these simple tasks were met with similar disbelief. 

Are these things so uncommon in modern society now? I work with several women (only women work at this particular house) who brag about not being able to cook or clean, which even beyond a RPW standpoint is ridiculous to me, since we work a job where both of those things are required. 

I don’t see why knowing basic skills like how to sew a rip in cloth or cook a meal make me something from the 50’s, or why people who can’t do basic domestic tasks act proud of that fact. It’s not attractive, in a partner, or a friend, or a coworker even to act like you being incompetent/childish is funny and quirky.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bfj2l2/apparently_knowing_how_to_cook_and_sew_is_odd_to/,1555806546.0,143,0.97,40,RedPillWomen,taurusbaker

beyn54,I realized that I have absolutely nothing to offer men.,"Hi so... I'm not really sure where to start here as my mind is all over the place 

Sure to (certain) men, I probably have looks that might interest them for the time being, but that's about it.

It's occurred to me in the last several months, during which I've been focusing on self reflection, that I have nothing to offer in a romantic relationship.

I've come to understand that what men want is a woman who is empathic and emotionally mature, someone who ""loves him for who he is"" and not what he can do for her. Someone who is willing to understand him and appreciate him beyond what he has to offer externally. Someone who isn't going to be resentful when he doesn't completely act the way she expects him to, and doesn't try to manipulate. She can also find happiness on her own, and doesn't expect him to validate her emotionally in every way.

And that's not me at all, nor am I sure that can ever be me.

I don't want to get into details, but I have a lot of emotional baggage, namely from feeling like my parents never truly loved or accepted me in an unconditional manner, and this gave some serious self esteem issues. Hell I was reading about ""attachment theory"" and I think I fall into anxious-preoccupied pretty well. 

I think I was looking for a partner to provide me what (I felt) that my parents never gave me, and unfortunately that's just not a good reason to get into a relationship. I am more focused on what a partner can do for me and less what I can do for the partner, and whether I can love them in a similar fashion.

 I'm at a cross roads where I have this information, but not sure where to go from here. Sure I can work on my problems, but I have no clue how long that'll take or if I'll ever recover. Hell, I think it's possible I have no clue what ""love"" truly means outside of liking someone who fits certain criteria you've established. 

I don't think it's fair, especially at this point, for any man to be with me.

I'm wondering if there are any women on here who are similar to me? Did you decide to continue to pursue romantic relationships while working on emotional issues? Or did you forgo relationships entirely?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/beyn54/i_realized_that_i_have_absolutely_nothing_to/,1555677616.0,126,0.95,61,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

bd48sk,Angry Men,"  

As women, it can be hard to understand angry men. Our instincts differ sharply, fundamentally, biologically. When I am faced with disappointment, betrayal, loss, failure, or frustration, I might shed a few tears, retreat to the embrace of those who love me, or process through meditation or other self care practices. We all have unique methods of handling difficult times, and while many of us may feel angry and upset at times, I have found that some women find an angry man unsettling and want them, especially those we love, to process more like women. But it’s disrespectful, and unreasonable, to expect men to behave like women during times of stress.

Part of my own personal development toward becoming the best partner and woman I can be has been to try to gain a deeper understanding and respect for my man when he is upset. I have begun to realize the immense responsibility that men carry every day that women, even in the modern era, do not have to bear on their shoulders. The men in our lives are fundamentally responsible for their own survival and wellbeing, as well as ours; they have been for thousands of years. This drive resides deep within their DNA. And while I have set out to have my own career as a nurse, I know that no matter how bad things get, he will take care of me.

Anger can manifest itself in destructive ways, which has significant consequences to society: war, homicide, mass shootings, and dangerous ideologies. But anger also can manifest itself in productive ways. The world was built on the backs of angry men – men who have seen the world, and set out to make it a better place. Men facing stress, frustration, and oppression have brought their families thousands of miles through treacherous oceans, plains, mountain ranges, in search of freedom and a better life. They have built homesteads, communities, and nations. They have died for causes they believed in, for the preservation of society, for the safety of their families. 

And although in the modern era, our men are not pioneers and nation builders, they are each fighting their own battle. And when they experience conflict, whether a threat to their livelihood, community, or wellbeing, let them be angry. Because the opposite of anger is complacency. And a complacent man is weak, ineffectual, and a passive subject to a broken world. An angry man is a dangerous man, and only a dangerous man can keep my family safe. He has agency, he has ambition, he has drive. Give him something to fight for, not against. Respect productive anger. Let Men be Men. Or one day, there might not be any of them left.

Addendum: I of course am not referring to childlike temper tantrums, or manipulators, bullies, and abusers – that is weakness. I’m talking about men of strength, resolve, and passion. This should be obvious.

bby4lp,On the importance of vetting,"I come from a mediterranean culture and the other day I was having a deep conversation with my mom about my grandma's, hers and my life.     
She said *""when your grandma was young, the only possibility for women was to learn how to be a homemaker, marry and then make and educate kids.""*     
We were talking about one of my grandma's sister who married a mean man who controlled and hit her and I asked my mother *""so, who taught those women how to choose their man well?""* and she said *""no one.""*   

I know we all have different views on feminism, but I think we can all agree on something : women didn't use to have a choice.    
And now we do, and we can't let go of that because it is vital for our own happiness to *be able* to chose how we want to live our lives and with whom.    

You don't have to be like my great-aunt who is still loyal to her decaying husband everyday, despite every horrible thing he did to her and their kids. You don't have to be like your mother, your father or anyone for that matter. You can be whatever you decide to be, but first you have to live and you have to think about what you want.   
I sometimes see the advice of marrying young but I personally think it's best to have some experience in order to really know what you're looking for. Your first LTR doesn't have to be the last and look up on sunk cost fallacy if you're feeling trapped in a relationship.      

I think vetting is the most important and useful advice we give here. Without it, we become like my grand mother and her sisters who didn't have a say in their lives. 

Don't be like my grand-mother.    
Cook and clean and be submissive because you chose to, not because some social theory told you so.    
Vet with all your heart and soul, I can guarantee that when you find someone to spend your life with, you not only know it, but also *feel it*. Make sure to read up on the cycle of abuse and its signs, make a list if that's your thing (I surely did) with the important things you want in a man and also the most important deal-breakers. Put yourself out there when you're ready and don't forget to honor all of the women who made it possible for you to be able to make choices today :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/bby4lp/on_the_importance_of_vetting/,1554977578.0,104,0.93,20,RedPillWomen,rp_lili

b708vd,Always Be Sure to Tie a Live Duck to Your Right Ankle.,"*Whhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?*

**Exactly.**

That's the experience of reading some of these questions. I'll be skimming along, yes, okay, dead bedroom, trying to do better, been reading RPW for a few weeks/months, boyfriend is like this, she is like that, yeah, yeah, looks familiar... and then, suddenly:

&gt;&gt; I've been trying to improve. Every day I tie a live duck to my right ankle, just like the red pill advises. It's hard, but I'm getting used to the quacking now. He doesn't seem to like it, though.

... or something only slightly less ridiculous.  

What? 

The red pill advises *whatnow*? 

When did I write this? When did any EC write this, here or on TRP? Who wrote this? How on earth did you come to think this was any part of red pill advice? 

As if we didn't already know.

Some of y'all been going to university, and listening to the freshman in the back of the class, who's straight of out high school, instead of to the professor's lecture. 

Example: 

&gt;&gt; Our relationship has worked up to this point because I worked the RedPill and part of this included hiding my fetishes with him so I would appear to be a quality woman.

This poor girl somehow got confused, listened to the newcomers in the cheap seats, thought it was redpilled advice because it was a comment on RPW, and thought that: 

* Quality women don't have fetishes (What?)
* Quality women lie to their spouses. (Seriously?)
* Lying and hiding information from a man helps him to be a good and effective leader. (No. Just... no.)
* You can white-knuckle your way through life suppressing your own needs (I'll pass, thanks.)

RPW is no different than every other place in the human sphere... it's fulla people who love to hear themselves talk. Some of those advice comments are coming from people who just showed up here yesterday, and have never had a successful relationship in their lives. It's kinda dumb for them to be pontificating, but the mod team's not gonna ban them all, because that's like trying to hold back a glacier, and, hey, they need to learn, too. 

So be careful who you listen to. 

We invented the EC tag system to make this easier on you. There are some people you know you can rely on, with big, easy to read stamps on them for your convenience. The mods have vetted them for a long time, to make sure they know what they are talking about, and continue to watch them to make sure quality stays high. (Yes, tags have been yanked in the past, for bad advice, or losing the trust of the community). 

Others, you might wanna ask yourself if what you just heard is really in line with the way we try to build healthy relationships. 

And if you're trying some principle that just isn't working out for you no matter how hard you try, try asking yourself if that's really something we actually teach... or you just picked up that impression from somewhere. 

And for god's sake, don't hide your kinks from your husband. (Eyeroll.) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/b708vd/always_be_sure_to_tie_a_live_duck_to_your_right/,1553881179.0,100,0.94,22,RedPillWomen,Whisper
b60ib3,Being a wife vs. being a girlfriend -- a small thought,"One tiny thing that changes when you are married is the status you're accorded by your social circle.

Today, my husband interrupted a work call saying, ""Excuse me, I need to say goodbye to my wife.""

I thought it was sweet, of course. But it occurred to me that there is a difference in saying ""my wife"" rather than ""my girlfriend."" The first implies: you are happy/satisfied at home &amp; have something that requires attention that supercedes part of work. The second would mean... maybe you're being controlled or the 'girlfriend' would be mad if you didn't say goodbye. That doesn't mean either thing is TRUE, just what others generally may draw from the exchange.

Similarly, my husband took the day off of work for my birthday recently &amp; mentioned to me how it felt natural to say he was taking the day off for his wife's birthday, but it would be weird to take the day off for his girlfriend's birthday.

Basically, he told me that he was feeling an anger inside, and wasn't enjoying our time all together as a family (baby and toddler).

After reflecting and speaking more about it; I realised that it was his issue to work on by himself, rather than anything I had done. I simply just made sure to be mindful in keeping our home a soft landing place for him, listened whenever he wanted to talk, gave advice only when he asked, and made sure that he had space and time to himself.

To be honest, at times I felt frustrated with him. Still, I (almost) never showed this - and instead chose to show grace, patience, and love.

The other day, he told me ""thank you for all that you do, it doesn't go unnoticed"", and couldn't stop staring in my eyes and telling me how wonderful I am. He is feeling much better (of course it will take time), and it's lovely that he is being more open with me about how he's feeling. Yesterday, he spoke to me all evening about some work difficulties. It wasn't exactly my dream evening, but I knew that he really needed that, so just sat and listened. Of course I'm far from perfect, but have really been trying my best.

The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is that she leans very heavily Christian, which makes a tiny portion of her advice unapplicable/unrelatable to those who aren’t Christian or who aren’t as intensely Christian (I’m the latter). Still, she seems to have a great head on her shoulders, and she’s definitely worth checking out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/b4hadj/found_a_cool_rpwesque_youtuber/,1553333629.0,66,0.96,17,RedPillWomen,tansandbeaches
b4czvd,Has anyone noticed that movies/shows seem to all star aggressive/masculine women nowadays?,"Hello wise hive! 

Has anyone noticed a trend of masculine and aggressive women in movies and popular culture?

I saw captain marvel last night with my husband and afterwards we discussed it and he noted that the female lead character was a backchatting and violent woman eg. had a snappy answer for everything and kept punching men in the face. When I thought about other things we’ve watched recently in Netflix or otherwise, there seems to be this common theme. They are also showing a lot of women having affairs, being violent towards men (eg. slapping or punching them), calling all the shots and the male character bumbling along behind them trying to keep up. I find the male characters a total turn off and the women I just don’t identify with at all, which makes me wonder if I’m too old fashioned and boring? 

Anyone else noticed this? Any other examples?

b2ndso,He told me to pick out rings!,"Hello ladies! 

Happy to be here with an update. 

For reference: I'm 26F, he's 26M. Together 6 years. 

I've posted in the past about:

- His picky eating habits vs. my foodie cooking
- His reluctance to move in with me

I'm happy to report the following:

- He's moved in and is paying more than I requested (I asked for half, he's supplementing 65% - makes him feel more like a man by providing more! win win!)
  
- We meal plan together (with Wednesday being ""Wildcard Wednesday"" where I get to make WHATEVER I WANT) and haven't had a single issue regarding any homemade meals. His palate has expanded INSANELY and he's starting to get excited about Wednesday more than grilled chicken/rice/broccoli Mondays. He no longer says/does anything that feels discouraging/insulting of my cooking and I'm not forcing him to eat things he doesn't like. So another win-win.

- I also mentioned in an update thread (I think it was valentines day) that his own dad (his mom &amp; dad are redpilled af and incredible role models) asked him ""WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU MARRIED HER YET?"" and he decided to corner me on St.Pat's (they're Irish) to tell me all about the cute little baby socks he saw at the store and when I wanted to have kids. (aka - parents more than approve!)

- This morning, after an amazing weekend - he told me I can start showing him the rings I like (I've been meekly asking for months) and that we should finally go get our nails done together (He works with his hands and I've been asking him to try a manicure with me (to improve his cuticles so they stop bleeding) and we have a giftcard (so he doesn't think it's a waste of money).  I've only asked that he considers 3 things when asking me to marry him - my nails are done, my skin is clear and it's being filmed. 

(Small but important - his ""side passion"" has become his full-time income, I put in a lot of hard work to help him with this with no payout for myself (be very wary, this is not for everyone) but it has paid off significantly, he's estatic about his company). 

**So, ring - check. Nails - check. Parents - check.**

He's also been relentlessly telling me how ""life-changing"" and ""absolutely amazing"" and ""the best year yet"" this spring is going to be for us. 

So, my dots have connected and IM GETTING ENGAGED!!!!!

I'll obv update once the ring is actually on my finger, but I just wanted to offer a small field report as to what RP values can do for many people. I was bluepill, a raging feminist when he met me. I learned I actually, truly, wanted nothing more than to be a wife and mother. I found out he loves that too, and wants to support me. I found new ways to communicate, to take care of myself, to *let go*. Being redpilled was the best thing that happened to me (s/o Jordan Peterson, a prof from my university) for initializing these changes and an even BIGGER s/o to myself for turning myself into the best version of myself.

I'd also like to mention I'm depression free, something I struggled with for over 7 years. (Also I'm sure a huge factor into this possible engagement). 

I feel like myself, not even an average version of myself, but the best version. Now? He liked it so he's gonna put a ring on it. 

I learned my hand, I played my cards and I won the jackpot. 

Keep up the work ladies, it's worth it!

b0mrpz,How to make your man feel good in front of other guys/what NOT to do?,"One time a while back, the guy I was dating passed by his friends place to pick something up and we ended up chilling there for a bit and drinking. They were talking about cars and the friend asked me what kind of car is better- blank or blank. I answered with my real opinion. I didn’t realize that it was his car vs my guy’s car. So when we left he asks me “are you into my friend or something?” i was shocked and didn’t know why he would think that. Then I remembered the car convo. So, apparently, siding with your man trumps all else, especially when it’s another guy asking. Ok I get it, I see how it could be interpreted. You are supposed to make him feel good and show people that y’all are united. 

What else? Laughing at another man’s jokes? Smiling too big at another guy? Just keep it professional? (I no longer drink)

az46d6,Jealousy and the secret weapon against the forbidden fruit: honey,"There's been a lot of posts about jealousy over the past few weeks and I thought it might be helpful to share a strategy for fighting it.

To paint out a common scenario: A couple has been in an LTR for an extended period of time and she notices that there is a girl texting him, making advances towards him, and exhibiting all-around flirtatious behavior that makes her uncomfortable about the whole ordeal.

The first gut reaction of many women is to yell, be controlling, go through his phone, start drama with the girl directly, or confront either party about it. Even if she doesn't do any if these, she makes her animosity known because she's bitter about the mere mention of *that other girl.*

Exhibiting these types of jealous behaviors does not work. Plain and simple. Nobody wants to be yelled at, have their privacy invaded, or deal with drama. Acting out this way can make a man think things like ""My girlfriend is extremely controlling and crazy, why am I with her?""

**Proceeding with these behaviors makes the forbidden fruit sweeter.** You're placing restrictions on what he can and cannot do. What did Simba do when Mufasa told him to never go to the shadowy land? He went to the shadowy land. What did Adam and Eve do when God said, well, yeah, you get the idea? Think about it. When you drive a wedge in and start drama, you're telling him that for whatever reason, you don't think you are good enough and you're worried the forbidden fruit is better. On top of that, that other girl, she's being flirtatious and fun. You? You are being a raging and controlling girlfriend. Now *who* is more fun to talk to right now? Definitely not you!

So what should you do? **Get in the right mindset and fight the forbidden fruit with honey.** When outside factors and temptations come at your man, it's best to remember that **he is with you, and not that other girl, for a reason, and it's best to not let him forget that either.** Instead of letting jealousy and controlling behavior to rule you, let the interaction play out, and when it's over and he's still at your side, remind him about that cute little outfit you want to try on for him at home. Straddle him on his lap so he can't put the phone in his face and give him some sugar. If you're a pro, you can even get away with saying things like ""Oh, she's cute."" While making advances. 

**It works because it reinforces that you have something the forbidden fruit doesn't.** She may be batting her pretty little eyelashes at your friend's social function, but no matter how cute she thinks she is, you're the one who knows how to blow his mind in the bedroom at night. You know his favorite dish, you know exactly where that sore spot on his neck that he likes rubbed is, and you know that innocent little move you can do that drives him wild in public. You have knowledge on your side, and, well, she has eyelashes.

**It works because the focus is brought back on your relationship instead of driving a wedge for the forbidden fruit to work its way in.** You're providing a positive distraction away from the forbidden fruit. When you grab his phone and go through it, or you get mad about it, you provide a negative distraction and opening the door for him to exhibit escapist behaviors, like getting angry and storming out. That gives the forbidden fruit the opportunity to slide right in. Acting this way is the easiest way to show a lack of respect and trust for your man which brings me to my third point:

**He's less likely to hide his behaviors or be secretive if you are fighting the forbidden fruit with honey.** Making him feel comfortable to interact with the forbidden fruit will give you the opportunity to rate your vetting decision. A high quality man would decline her advances in a way the doesn't degrade the forbidden fruit, nor does it degrade you. Allowing the interaction to play out shows that **you trust him to make good decisions about your relationship and you respect him enough to not cause a scene.** On the flip side, if he's flirting back and acting in poor form, that's your sign that he may not be a high quality mate after all, and it's time to move on.

Jealousy is something that may pop up in any relationship from time to time, and handling it smartly can make or break a relationship. Instead of letting the forbidden fruit become a temptation, remember that honey is sweeter and you have it at your disposal, not to mention honey is a display of trust and respect, and bitterness is a display of the exact opposite.

awnpi5,My boyfriend made it big and I'm worried I'll get dumped.,"Burner account in case my SO happens to read my main reddit account posts.

I recently 23, in a long term relationship with a 25 year old man. We met 3 years ago in college and have been dating ever since. He was beta when we first met, had sexual anxiety issues, body image issues, and acne and I supported him and helped him work through it because underneath he was intelligent and ambitious and this was very attractive to me.  I almost broke up with him a few times in the first year of our relationship due to his occasional drug use and other immature habits I wont get into here. He eventually straightened his life out and things improved after that. 

Around that time last summer he had a really inspired period and decided to co-found a marketing business. He dropped out of his masters program the following autumn and worked many hours coding and promoting and talking to his friends/partners about it while I supported him, kept our apartment clean, cooked almost every night, etc. I could see his potential and really went all in for him even though I was also working at the same time to support us. For a long time it looked like the business wasn't going anywhere but around 3 months ago we happened to get a really big client and finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. The software started to pick up traction around Christmas time and now it seems like we are really going to make it big. He keeps talking about moving to San Francisco and seems like he's serious about buying a large house there. He's bought a lot of stupid stuff/guy toys in the past 3 weeks, and he got me a new Tesla for my birthday. 

Last weekend we went out for dinner with some of our mutual friends from college and I noticed that there was a really weird atmosphere of jealousy and strangeness I've never seen before. One of my friends kept subtly hitting on my boyfriend and dropping him hints. It was making me really uncomfortable and he didn't seem to care or think about how I felt. I told him afterward and he apologized and reassured me but ever since then I've had this sinking dread in my stomach.  I think he really loves me and we are very comfortable around each other, but I'm not as smart as he is and he has always needed other people to talk to about esoteric things with. I'm scared that now that he is successful he is going to dump me for some 150 IQ model from SF that makes me look like a used paper towel. I used to be higher SMV than him but I can feel how women treat him now and that I'm hated by women who think they are better than me and think “Why does this bitch deserve a good man”. 

To make it worse he has always disliked serious discussions about marriage and family, even though he claims that his goal in life is to have a beautiful family that he provides for. I try not to be over-jealous and controlling but it's impossible to not see every attractive woman he talks to as a potential threat to our relationship. 
I have a horrible image in my mind of me turning into a jealous bitchy wreck that eats my own best shot at a successful life from the inside out and then has to watch my SO start a family with a prettier girl while I die alone with 9 cats. My greatest fear is that I will be discarded. 

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for honest advice but I need to vent and organize my thoughts at least because the pressure of the situation is making me feel insane. What do I do?

avfb7d,Women are expected to do so much these days,"Me and 2 older women I work with had this conversation today..

I have never been lucky enough to stay home with my kids. But I wish I would have tried harder to stay home. I think my life and my children would be totally different.

&amp;#x200B;

As modern day women, we are expected to work the same hours as a man, yet raise a family, rear children, feed our families healthy meals, get kids to appointments, school, activities, keep the house up, help with bills.. and so much more.

It's sad that a modern day man's salary can't support a woman staying home (at least) until kids are school aged. It would theoretically be so much easier to be a good partner, good parent, &amp; better person not having to stress about being a good employee, being on time, daycare, sick kids (because this happens more with daycare), etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Stay at home mom's are called lazy, and people act like they have it so easy. What is so wrong with a woman doing what she was biologically put on this earth to do... mother &amp; be a woman? Why is this no longer enough? &amp; why did this change?

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers (who have both been in the workforce a very longtime) agreed. Women overcome. We are resilient, but the amount of burden we endure while working, with kids, is tenfold of what men endure (at least in my experiences). I naturally know that I am responsible for the kids, getting them to and from school &amp; daycare, getting them ready, etc. This makes it really hard for a woman to be her best because we are excepted to do so much. Be so extra, work, school &amp; be a good mom, and balance it all with grace.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're on the fence about staying home with kids, I encourage you to do it. I truly regret not trying harder to stay with my babies.

If I am ever graced with another baby I will honestly do whatever it takes to stay home. Raising young children, and working, and schooling and LIFE will only make you a stressed out mess and your family will eventually bear your burdens.

av2lv4,Just wanted to thank the sub for the clothing advice,"Four months ago I solicited some help with my wardrobe ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/9qmr60/how_to_avoid_looking_frumpy_while_dressing/)) and the guidance I received was really, really helpful.  Since I presently clean for a living, I can't dress up for work, so I've ended up dressing more nicely on the weekends (form-fitting sweater and long black skirt).  On the weekend I often visit a card shop where I am one of very few women in the store and the others wear jeans/tees.  Lately there was some serious drama at the shop involving my abusive ex-boyfriend and the guys there came to my aid.  One who was only 15 told me that night ""I really respect you, we all do.""  It shocked me because that's not something I've heard a lot in my lifetime of casual unisex dress (tees, jeans and hoodies).  I think I carry myself somewhat differently when I dress up so that might also be part of it.

The flipside to the positive is that my good friend (male) who goes to the shop with me complained that my outfits seem like ""peacocking"" and that they are too dressy for the venue.  He seemed to think there was something embarrassing or cringy about it.  I told him I don't care if he thinks it's embarrassing because 1.) *I* like it and 2.) years ago in America men and women used to dress up for any public social gathering as a sign of respect.   (I wish more men in the shop would make a similar effort, they would look a lot nicer.)

So, just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my original post.  I feel a lot better about myself when I dress nicely and it does seem to make a difference in how I am seen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/av2lv4/just_wanted_to_thank_the_sub_for_the_clothing/,1551205040.0,63,0.93,11,RedPillWomen,LadySylwia

as27cr,Update: Can’t keep my mouth shut,"I’m really thankful for all the replies on that post!  It has been about 6 days.  I have tried really hard to keep my thoughts to myself (when they don’t help the situation at hand and especially if they are snarky).  I have done really well with the exception of one evening where I was super tired.  

I texted him an apology after he left saying that I was sorry for being disrespectful and for treating him like a child.  I have really spent a lot of energy on self care (especially sleep and waking early before the kids to get time to myself and getting a nap when they nap).  We actually had a lot of good conversation where I was able to explain that my stress levels feel really high and I end up just being irritable as a result.  I am aware that won’t help either of us (or the kids) in the long run.  Which I am well aware remain in the realm of my responsibility. So he was really supportive of me getting to bed earlier and we also decided to declare a weekly “Sabbath “ - no outside commitments &amp; no big cleaning/house projects.  Just low key hanging out as a family.  
So my being way less defensive/irritable/snappy led to a really relaxed Sunday.  We got the younger kids to nap, the older kids playing a video game... and we had some nice “alone time” ;).   We also had some good conversation that felt like another step in rebuilding things — which led him to being really vulnerable with me this morning about what he is going through.

9k2vqz,I tried dressing feminine for a day and this is what happened,"Growing up I wasn't very much of a girly-girl, especially didn't help that there was zero feminine women in my life to influence me. Currently I've been working on cultivating a feminine spirit and learning to be soft and loving but I felt a bit of a mismatch with how I felt on the inside with how I felt on the outside. I wasn't a complete tom boy, I just dress like an average college student, basically a combination of leggings+hoodie+sneakers+messy bun. I spent no effort on my look and only dipping into my feminine side for events like weddings and baby showers. 
 
I prided myself for a long time being 'uncomplicated' , 'low maintenance' and 'practical' but since I've been reading here I'm realizing just how masculine my attitude was towards my appearance, those were all traits men look for in cars but not necessarily in women. 
 
I'm slowly in the process of transforming my wardrobe to be more feminine but working with pieces I already had I decided to dress up and go out just to go shopping for a bit. Earlier this week I dressed much cuter for school and when I asked one of my class mates to help me he immediately got up and came over to help me, while in the past this same classmate would have ignored me or just make me ask the professor. I wanted to experiment more with dressing feminine and see what other conclusions I could gather. So I this morning I got out of the kiddy pool and hopped right into the deep end.
 
I put on a flirty silky polka dot top something like [this](https://awwoutfit.com/assets/images/resources/351/700x/cool-outfit-polka-dotts-blouse-plus-bag-plus-black-skinnies.jpg), wore a pair of skinny jeans (not feminine but working on it) that really show off my small waist and long legs, a pair of high heels, and some dainty gold hoops, a really classy somewhat conservative look but still showed my figure underneath. I have been growing my nails out and painting them soft pretty colors lately and went ahead and put on makeup (just concealer, mascara and a nice pink lipstick, all very natural but still pretty).  Most importantly I've been working on my demeanor, I have a neutral expression on my face most of the time and have been trying to smile more when people speak or make eye contact with me. I wasn't forcing myself to smile at everyone but just a natural happy peaceful look. Dressing nicely made me want to be seen so it felt easy for me to drop the resting bitch face. I felt as pleasant on the inside as I do on the outside.
 
So how did it go? Well at first my boyfriend asked me ""you sure you want to  go to the mall this dressed up?"" I don't really dress up for the poor guy so it was exciting for him, if anything, the one thing I learned was how much a guy appreciates being seen with someone that takes care of their appearance, he had a small sense of pride guiding me through the mall and talking to me throughout the day, even helping me off the escalator. In the past he had no reason to do so because I presented myself as capable, but suddenly wearing heels and being on moving stairs he had the desire to help me. 
 
We went to the mall mostly for him so it wasn't like I dragged him there but  I was window shopping a bit for myself. The most noticeable thing was how many guys turned to take a second look at me, even while with their girlfriends. At first I thought maybe I dressed too out of place , but women paid no attention to me. The attention was different. At one point I saw a guy take a triple take looking at me and then his girlfriend, who was dressed in sweats and a hoodie. I think many guys enjoy the soft feminine side of women and it's seen less and less these days. 
 
The least surprising thing is how much employees wanted to help me, every store I went into I was approached by employees asking if they could help me, especially from men. Normally when I'm in this same mall it's quite busy and if I need something I have to hunt someone down. I magically became approachable, like people were drawn to me. Afterwards I went to the grocery store to pick up dinner and I couldn't believe I was -that- woman. By that I mean the 1 random woman I see at the grocery store that's dressed up to the nines in a nice pair of heels and her hair perfectly in place. Even the cashier recognized me and immediately started a conversation while in the past wouldn't say much. I was instantly inviting. 
 
In the past before I started reading redpillwomen I actually thought the only way Women could draw attention from men was by wearing garish colors, booty shorts, crop tops, what ever is in fashion or other overly revealing clothes, basically a forever21 clone. What I've learned is that you can't really stand out if everyone else is doing the exact thing. I never had the issue of standing out because I tend to dress in ways that hid me. But I also realized how unfair it was to myself to hide my body, I am pretty lucky that I don't have to work hard to be thin or have nice hair but my current wardrobe obscured everything about me that is feminine. 
 
My final thoughts:
 
I think if you are having a hard time with being approached by men this would instantly up your game, in addition to online dating. If you already have a partner then absolutely dress for them. It sounds weird but I felt like my partner respected me more for dressing up, mostly because I honored myself first by taking care of my appearance. It also made his role as the provider/ protector more fulfilling for him and apparent. I think all in all: dress like a prize and men will always feel like they won.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/9k2vqz/i_tried_dressing_feminine_for_a_day_and_this_is/,1538276239.0,185,0.96,44,RedPillWomen,GettingMyShitInOrder

9h1afr,I really hate gynocentrism!,"I just have to get something off my chest. I hate our gynocentric society. 

My husband is a great man. Full of self control, discipline and difficult to be influenced. He is a pilot by training, which means he does not solely operate on emotions, only logical reasoning. After we got married and had children, his drive to work harder increased. He’s given up a lot of hobbies but definitely not all and I wouldn’t want him to anyways.

For some reason, my support for him to pursue some of his hobbies/passion/career gets nothing but criticism (especially these last few days). Female acquaintances and even family members think he should have no hobbies and no free time because that’s just UNFAIR for me. I mean, the comments are NASTY!

9gyc8u,Ditch the Resume,"One of the most common mistakes both men and women make when trying to attract the opposite sex is *projection*. 

Men who don't understand women will woo them with displays of devotion and declarations of passion (and come off appearing pathetic rather than attractive), because they think what *men* want is simply what *people* want. 

And women who do not understand men will attempt to increase their allure by making a show of confidence they don't feel, and ""playing hard to get"" with a show of challenging aloofness, because they think what *women* want is simply what *people* want. 

When women have significant academic or career accomplishments, they tend to fall into a particular example of this trap... *assuming that men care, or should care, what they have accomplished*. This can take the form of *""resume courtship""* (attempting to appeal to men by showing or speaking of accomplishments or capabilities), attempting to attract a man's attention by competing with him (a real turnoff), or even *actually becoming angry* that men do not value her small business, her executive title, or her PhD. 

This is a form of projection. While **women use a man's accomplishments to evaluate his character, but men do not**... they have other ways to do that which they prefer. 

Why? 

Simple. Because *men like young women*. A 21 year old cannot meaningfully be evaluated by asking ""Does she have a PhD in philosophy?"", because no 21 year old does. A man who wishes to court her must find other ways of evaluating if she is intelligent enough to understand the world around her, a good conversationalist, and possessed of a sense of curiosity. He cannot simply ask ""has she built a business from the ground up?"" because she won't have done that, either... he must find other ways to evaluate if she resourceful, self-disciplined, and capable of sticking to a goal. 

So, you might think that if you have a PhD, and your husband has a PhD, your PhD matters to him... but it doesn't. It didn't make him pick you. What made him pick you was the traits that enabled you to get it, coupled with the fact that he ran into you in that environment because you were there in the first place... that's how you met. 

To understand this, it helps to hear a tale I was once told by a sports reporter. Apparently, the athletes' village at each olympic games is the site of a great deal of promiscuity. (Anyone surprised? Didn't think so.) But apparently the dynamic shifts as the games wear on, and more and more events are completed. As event results come in, female athletes begin to display a marked preference for male *medalists*. (Anyone surprised? Didn't think so.) But the instructive part is that the males do *not* display a corresponding preference. Female olympic athletes are highly desirable because they are pretty, healthy, energetic, and vital... but *it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether they won or not*. The losers are still all of these things, and the men still seek them out. 

The takeaway looks like this: 

* Men don't care about your victories, only the traits you used to get them. 
* Men don't use your victories to measure your traits or character. 
* Never expect a man to love you for your accomplishments, you will be disappointed. 
* Never build a resume for the sake of attracting a man. Only do it if you want it for some other reason. 
* Never assume you are unable to attract a high-status man because you lack the  accomplishments of other women in his life. All you need is the combination of traits he desires.

9fx5jj,"Regretting my ""alpha"" career, do I even have a chance at the love life I want?","Warning: Rant incoming

I'm a medical student on the road to becoming a doctor and I hate my life. I've been lurking on RPW for a while and think the ideologies really make sense but I don't know how to deal with this ""career woman"" path I got myself trapped into. I am absolutely miserable as a medical student but have way too much debt to not follow through. I looked deep into myself and realized that all I really, truly, deeply want is to build a family with a man who cares for me and takes care of me. But I've been indoctrinated with the idea that women HAVE to strive for success, especially given how lucky I was to have the opportunity for a great education. 

Men who want a serious relationship and a family don't consider me because my career is a huge hindrance to that. And I totally understand that. No matter how feminine I act, or take care of my body/looks, I still am restrained by my career in terms of time and energy I have to devote to a man. By the time I'm done residency training, I'll be old (+ stress aging!) and reaching my last years of fertility. Not to mention many men just straight out assume I'm the bitchy, cold, ""career woman"" type the second they learn that I'm a medical student (thanks for this reputation, other med student gals 🙄)

People recommend that I just find a ""house husband"" to take on the feminine role, but I can't feel any attraction towards a man who is not more masculine, high-achieving, intelligent, and ambitious than me. Meanwhile alpha men don't want to deal with competing with me or dealing with the fact that so much of my energy must go towards my masculine ambitions. 

I am so distraught that I will never find the relationship I've always wanted because I chose this stupid career. While I still agree with the feminist idea that women and men should be ABLE to achieve the same things in the work sphere, I am so mad that modern feminism made me believe that it was the BEST way to go. Because no amount of career accomplishment is going to squash the little girl in me who just wants to be loved and protected and cared for.

After reading so many RPW resources about attraction, such as (but not limited to) :

I really internalized that men really, really couldn't care less about what career I am in or whether or not I have a PhD. I was completely projecting when I thought my education and accomplishments would make me attractive to the opposite sex. And that makes SO. MUCH. SENSE.

In fact, the author of these articles mentions that for men, dating a woman with a better education/career than him is akin to a woman dating a man who is much, much better looking than him, so much so that he steals her spotlight in the beauty department. 

While most women would want to date someone who is attractive, they wouldn't want to date someone who puts much more attention and value to their own beauty than any woman, that would be a huge turn off. Likewise, while most high-caliber men would like to date someone who is at least educated and/or has a career, they wouldn't want to date someone who is *much* more powerful than him, as that would render his role as the provider useless.

I think of it this way. I wouldn't want to date someone like [Harry Styles](https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Harry-Styles.jpg), teenage heartthrob and band member. Sure, he's powerful, and very good looking, but his beauty is overpowering to the point where it would steal my spotlight in the relationship. 

I am also very turned off by men who do things like post ""artsy"" pictures of themselves on social media, wear tight-fitting pants, preoccupy themselves too much about their outfit choices, and so on. As long as they put some minimum effort into their appearance, and aren't complete slobs, that is good enough for me, and after a point, their efforts actually work against them.

Likewise, men would like women who are decently intelligent and have something going for themselves, but they wouldn't necessarily be turned-on by a CEO or doctor, who most likely will work long hours, be constantly under pressure, and have little-to-no time for a proper relationship. 

I don't want to date a feminized version of a man, I want to date a man. Likewise, men don't want to date a high-strung masculine version of a woman, they want to date a woman.

9eoknk,"(UPDATE) ""My hamster is spinning out of control -- someone smack some sense into me""","A little while ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/948mnj/my_hamster_is_spinning_out_of_control_someone/), the tl;dr of which was that my boyfriend didn't want me coming to the concert at which he was performing, and I was having a hard time accepting it gracefully. 

It ended up getting more attention than I expected, and /u/girlwithabike mentioned to me, after I gave her a brief update about what happened, that I should post a more complete update of what happened after I made that post. So here it is, and I hope it's beneficial to you all. 

So, a little while after I made that post, my boyfriend and I were driving somewhere and he started talking to me about his idea for the ""intro"" to their set (he was going to record the sound of the rain and all the spooky ""night sounds"" in the woods near our house), and I casually mentioned that I hoped the concert would be recorded, because I'd like to see how that would turn out on stage. I think this was his lightbulb moment of ""oh shit, I'm excluding my girlfriend from something she's actually interested in."" At this point, the practice sessions with his band were going well, he was less stressed about his own performance with the guitar/vocals, and the pressure of not having performed in so long/being out of practice was subsiding. Basically, he was able to think a bit more calmly about the situation -- instead of seeing me as another added stressor, he was seeing me as someone who loved him and would support him throughout the weekend. 

In a matter of a couple days after that comment, he went from, ""well, I mean, yeah you can come actually..."" to ""you're coming with me, I'm getting you in for free, you're eating with the rest of the musicians, and I've talked to the organizer about having you stay overnight to sleep with the rest of us.""

The concert was this weekend. He was, of course, a bit stressed, but not at all as much as he had been before. Being as the show was in a city a few hours away, and it was a pretty big event (pretty much an all-day thing), we left in the morning with one of his bandmates, and spent the weekend in a *very* scenic coastal city. The things he was stressed about (having to ""take care"" of me while they were doing sound check/throughout the day) ended up being non-issues. During soundcheck I explored the city a bit on my own, and there were enough events going on throughout the day, before the concert, to keep both of us busy. 

The concert itself was spectacular. I won't go into a ton of detail about it, but they performed amazingly well, and I was incredibly happy to have been there, and immensely proud of my boyfriend. 

Throughout the day and the evening, he was incredibly sweet (as always), we supported each other the way a couple should, and had a really fantastic time. To top it all off, the next day, before leaving to come back home, we ended up visiting the ocean at low tide and walking all along the beach. It was incredibly scenic and an amazing experience. 

Here's what I learned from this event:

Sometimes, when men are stressed or anxious, they see everything as a problem to be solved, and will start trying to avert crises before they happen. 

I also learned that I need to just chill out and *trust him*! It's not surprising that he reacted in a negative way during a time of stress, because he was in a mode of trying to put out a bunch of fires at once (I later learned, for example, that his bassist had been slacking and hadn't learned all the songs at the time I made the original post -- obviously another stressor).

If there's anything you all take away from this update, it's that not everything is a big red flag, and your boyfriend not wanting to include you in something doesn't always mean he's got something to hide. Sometimes it means he wants alone time/time with the boys. Sometimes it just means he's stressed and needs time to process things clearly. I know some commenters were mentioning he was hoping to exclude me in order to get some groupie tail. Firstly, I know him well enough to know this isn't the case, and would never be the case. Secondly, let me close off by mentioning what he said to  me to close off the night --

9dkyxr,Avoid loving opportunistically,"There's a fallacy spread in our culture that says that there's a prince charming for you somewhere, and while that may be true for some, the fallacy extends itself by saying that you won't be happy until you find him.

Love, in my view, is more of something you build that something you find. My man and I are not ""perfect"" for each other in many ways, but we have experiences from being together a long time that I'll never be able to replicate with someone else.

Love becomes mediocre at times. The honeymoon period ends, and you're left with the day-to-day drone of real life, with passion merely existing in the background. This is normal and healthy. There will be periods where you think you don't feel anything for him, because humans naturally become conditioned to sensory input over time, as well as emotional input, when it becomes a constant.

Long-term love becomes something you don't appreciate until it's gone. Monogamy can get boring, everyday, mediocre, but appreciate that you have that luxury. Appreciate that love is so abundant in your life that it becomes like breathing. Don't take your boredom for granted, the reason couples stay together so long is that they don't up and leave whenever things get mildly inconvenient.

Don't relentlessly search for something better, because chances are you'll never have what you do now. There is value in something you've built with someone over such a long period of time you begin to take it for granted. Instead, focus on ways you can get that spark back. Continue building that love by having new experiences together. Travel, go rock climbing, experiment in the kitchen, try a new sex position. Love is not worth losing over boredom or the possibility of ""more"" being out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/9dkyxr/avoid_loving_opportunistically/,1536255400.0,112,0.98,10,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
9d7pe0,A word of hope for you who may feel hopeless,"I want to disclose a story that I think will give some hope to some of you who think you've been dealt a losing hand.

A bit of background: I'm a entrepreneur who recently set about growing a company a friend(now partner) started. He was very happy with all I'd done for the company, and wanted me to meet his wife and kids. Of course, I was happy to do so. As such, one day his wife came to help us run operations.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've always been a fan of the saying ""Women are born, men are made"". I'd be lying if I said I didn't think it came from a slight animus I carry towards women, but I digress. Put simply, women are born with and grow naturally what men seek(youth, fertility, looks), where as men earn what women seek(wealth, confidence, competence). This was an especially raw deal for women who were dealt a bad hand biologically speaking, and there is relatively little to do besides lose weight, wear makeup and adjust the wardrobe. Or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, my partner's wife was by no means a pretty woman. Speaking frankly, her looks probably ranked in the bottom 25%, but her figure was not bad, you could tell she was fit. Yet, somehow by then end of our day working together, I found myself strangely attracted to this woman. Now, to put this into perspective as objectively as possible, I'd place myself at the 70-75th percentile of men, but definitely improving. I get a fair amount of female attention, and I've turned away women before who I deemed unsuitable as a long term mate. This being disclosed, one would wonder how I found myself attracted to an objectively ugly woman. Besides her being small(my preference), it all lay in demeanor.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout our day, she carried herself in a way that was feminine and confident. She displayed competence in dealing with our customers, but was never combative or competitive in her work. She spoke softly and smiled often, and the few times we spoke she was supportive and complimentary. She brought my partner and I lunch and was attentive to our needs whilst working. Furthermore, in the end of day discussion and planning for the future between my partner and I, she contributed without wresting control of the conversation from either of us.

That is to say, she was demure, pleasant, competent, attentive and feminine. Notice that all of these traits can be cultivated. When I drove home that day, I decided that I would easily rate her as above the majority of women I knew. If there were a woman who was even near average on looks with the same traits, I'd wager I'd be lovestruck in an instant.

Now, I'm much more family/relationship oriented than the average man, so there is a morsel of bias to be had here. However, if it is a committed relationship is what you're after, then allow me to assert that it is men of my ilk you should be after.

&amp;#x200B;

The moral of the story is, no matter what biological hand you've been dealt, you can increase your value as a woman dramatically by being feminine, competent, attentive, and pleasant. This is because after braving the world, men need a home. That home is not a house. That home is you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/9d7pe0/a_word_of_hope_for_you_who_may_feel_hopeless/,1536161931.0,71,0.88,20,RedPillWomen,Wolfssenger

97v1w1,Nobody Ever Told Me...,"I had taken the blue pill without even realizing I swallowed it. 

10 years ago, I was a raging, hippie liberal feminist. Fresh out of my college indoctrination, angry at George Bush, and fighting battles with anyone who was to the right of me, I rode on a bus with other angry college kids to protest drilling in ANWAR, and I was knee deep into the CODEPINK culture.

I look back now, and I laugh. I loved that girl -- her fiery passion, her fearlessness, her desire to change the world... but MY GOD did she have it all wrong. 

Thankfully, God, the Universe, a higher power of sorts, had a different plan for my life. When I turned 23, I met a guy -- a raging conservative -- who took each and every one of my world views and shredded them. He challenged all of my arguments and annihilated them. At first, I was lost, angry, and super confused. But as I began to learn more, read more, and understand more, I learned to appreciate this young man's frame of mind. I willingly swallowed the red pill, at least from a political perspective. 

We dated for 2.5 years, but I still didn't know what I wanted in a partner. We split up, but 8 years later, I'm still friends with this man.

While normally we discuss politics, history, or religion, we began talking relationships a few months back. We had an interesting discussion.

So, here's a little back story on me. I'm a smart, independent woman -- I have a college degree, a good job, I own a rental property, I'm almost debt free. I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I (usually) take good care of my body and I cook &amp; clean as well. I'm positive, and I'm outgoing -- I also went through a pretty nasty break-up 2 years ago, and have really just been working on getting myself back to ""good"". 

I took a solid inventory of myself and what I offer in a relationship and realized the things that *I* want in a partner. In fact, I do most of them myself. I just figured, at some point, I'd find someone to mirror that... lead by example, right? 

But nobody ever told me what a man would want from me. Actually, that's not entirely true.

You know who I got my advice from?

\- Magazines (Cosmo, Seventeen, Redbook)  
\- Hollywood (TV, Movies... Super realistic, I know)  
\- My girlfriends (Not men...)

Never once did I sit down and ask a man what he truly thought would make a good girlfriend, partner or wife. 

Now, when men do tell us what they want, feminists call them misogynistic and the media tells them that they're wrong. Imagine that -- a man, being told that what he chooses for himself, is wrong... 

Anyway, back to our discussion. So, I asked my friend pointe blank -- what do men *actually* want in a relationship or a marriage.

He said, ""Men are simple. We want a girl that lets us lead. This doesn't mean she's a doormat, but she doesn't try to take control of every situation. We want her to take care of her body. Ideally, she'd be younger, but there are some young girls that are flat out idiots (look at you when I met you, he said. Haha). There's good physical chemistry, she knows how to communicate and resolve conflicts. If she can make me feel good about who I am physically and mentally (and she can cook, he added) she's worth my time.""

Interesting. We talked a little more. Basically, none of my accolades mattered to him (except the cooking part. Ha). 

He said being debt free is a bonus, but he makes decent money, so some student debt was okay. He said major credit card debt was a red flag. He said it was nice that I owned property, but so does he -- and he wouldn't live in a girl's place anyway. He said college degrees are nice, but not necessary. He said keep learning and keep working out. A sexy mind and a sexy body do wonders for women.

*Then he asked me why I was trying to be a man.*

I was taken aback by his question. He said, ""All of the things you do, you are essentially your own provider. Where does that leave room for a man in your life?""

I had honestly never looked at it that way. I always thought that I'd find a good partner because I embodied things that I wanted in a partner -- but it turns out that I've actually become my own worst enemy because, well, he's right. I don't technically need a man, even though I'd really like one.

His words struck a chord -- and although my sample size is quite small (yes, a whopping 1) I think there's a lot of truth in what he said. 

Here's what's interesting... I'm not the only woman who's living like this. The woman who, although she's feminine, has adopted a lot of ""masculine"" traits. Who believes and supports TRP philosophy, but is still living in a very BP world. 

But nobody ever told me what men really want. Who knew you had to go to the source?!

I started taking his advice a few months ago and have been poring over TRP, RPWomen and other books, blogs and articles for answers. 

Now that I know what my biggest obstacle is (myself) I can work on healthy ways to make a man feel needed and appreciated. 

It's time we start adding men back into the conversation about their wants and needs, and not trying to dictate that for them. I'm glad that this group exists because it's providing much-needed insight to the male mind and how we, as women, can be better partners.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/97v1w1/nobody_ever_told_me/,1534445623.0,191,0.94,43,RedPillWomen,rockstarberst

Thursday evening my husband and several of his friends took part in a motor bike charity ride. They camped out and came back around noon today.

95fizz,What I learned about male psychology in line at the airport,"Last November, I had a brief exchange with a man while boarding a red eye flight across the country that taught me an invaluable lesson about men and the state of masculinity.

**The Exchange:** I was exhausted, our flight was delayed, and by the time we began boarding around midnight, many of us had joined together in solidarity of our unfortunate present circumstances. The man standing behind me in line began to engage with me in small talk, as well as a few people around us. He asked me where I was heading, and I told him I had an interview for a nursing program. He said he was traveling for work, and I asked him what he did for a living. He sort of looked down at his feet, and told me, ""I don't know, it's pretty boring. You probably wouldn't want to hear about it.""  I laughed and said I'm sure that's not true. He explained that he worked for a company that was developing electrical devices that would be sealed into the concrete of skyscrapers that could remotely report the structural integrity of the building during earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. ""Just an office job."" I told him I actually really thought his work was very interesting and very cool, and that I was sure it would save a lot of people's lives. His eyes sort of lit up, he straightened up, stared at me, and told me he'd never really thought about it that way before. We got on the plane, I made my way to my seat, he ended up about ten rows in front of me, and a few minutes after sitting down, he stood up and passed his business card through ten rows of people, and gave me a wave.

I wasn't single, and probably wouldn't have been interested even if I had been. I was just trying to be kind and courteous to a stranger in line. But although he never heard from me, I really do hope he was able to keep that light in his eyes and confidence that I saw develop in those few fleeting moments.

**The Lesson:** It's the oldest archetype known to man. The Hero. The dragon-slaying princess-saving man of admiration and honor. The man little boys dream of becoming. In 2018, that little boy grows up to be told by women everywhere that his masculinity is toxic, that his strength is oppressive, that his accomplishments are the result of privilege, that his efforts are futile, that his nature is predatory, that fatherhood is meaningless, that husbands are useless...

...that he won't be able to find his way without pulling over and asking for directions.

In five minutes, a few words of encouragement, genuine interest, and admiration from a stranger completely changed this man's attitude about his work. It's quite possible that for the first time since he was a young boy, he felt like he could be a hero. A woman made him feel better about himself, instead of tearing him down. Imagine the impact you could have on a man in a lifetime. I take it back - the oldest archetype isn't the hero. It's the Woman. The Woman Worth Fighting For. The Woman that civilized man, the Beauty to the Beast. Feminism has decided that it's not fair that the hero archetype belongs to men - we want to be heroes too, right? But when you compete with a man instead of supporting him and loving him, you take away his pride and motivation, and become an adversary instead of his princess and number one fan.

Yes, ladies, we have a masculinity crisis in this country. But who's responsible, and what will it take to reverse the damage done? Whether you're entering the dating market, or have been married for 30+ years, take a second to remind yourself to look up at a man, instead of looking down on him. See the hero in them they desperately want to be, even if he does just work an office job. Be a woman who inspires him. Admire his efforts, thank him for his sacrifices, let him be your hero. And as he begins to see himself through your eyes, *magic happens*. I've even seen this happen over the course of the past several months with my own man, and can't wait to see where he'll go from here.

92zu21,A letter to young women,"A letter to the younger women of RPW,

I write to you as a young woman myself, as a recent college graduate, as someone who has found a man in whom I have the utmost confidence to lead and build a wonderful life and family with me. I know he will make a wonderful husband and father, and he has made clear his devotion and commitment to me. I couldn’t be happier. 

I know that many of you are still searching. My heart breaks for the young women in 2018 who are looking for traditional love and marriage in a sea of feminism, boys who never seem to grow up, or serial players and plate spinners. I read your stories. The real men out there seem few and far between, and many of you have reluctantly chosen a less-than-ideal man you think might have potential with the right encouragement, which often ends in disappointment. It’s easy to become discouraged and many women settle. 

But one of the beautiful aims of this subreddit is to encourage women to abandon the typical female dating narrative of: how can I get a good man to commit to me? In favor of a superior question: what type of woman is worth committing to, and how can I become one? 

The value of the man I’m with is clear to women who know him well, who either pursue him to no avail, ex girlfriends who still say they lost the best thing they’ve ever had, friends who tell me they want to find what I have, or cynically pretend he must be too good to be true. But these women have many things in common, expressing habits encouraged on college campuses and by feminism, habits that I myself had years ago, and habits that will be difficult to unlearn. I don’t have all the answers, but I hope someone out there can find this advice helpful. 

Be beautiful, not “hot”
Men have two evolutionary mating strategies built into their biology (edit: see link to Weinstein podcast below). Women need to know this. The first is to get as much seed as possible into as many women as possible, and hope some children are born and turn out okay. This is the older, more animalistic strategy, but has worked for some. The second is more “evolved.” You find one woman, with the best genes possible, and have children with her, but stick around to ensure their safety, competence, and survival. Monogamy has been around for millennia. These two strategies remain in men today, indicated by men unanimously answering two questions in the affirmative (try it): can you imagine a woman who is hot, but not beautiful? Can you imagine a woman who is beautiful, but not hot? These terms differentiate which mating strategy will be used. Hot women are the women in porn, strippers, or in clubs. The women men know they could sleep with, but would never bring home to their mother. Beautiful women are still sexually attractive, but their attraction expands beyond the physical to grace, kindness, intelligence, and feminine charm. The key difference: beautiful women are still beautiful as they age, even past an age where they might not be fertile. All men can identify a beautiful older woman, but would never find them “hot.” Men don’t commit to hot women, because sex is their only value, and will be useless over 35. 

College campuses encourage women to be hot. My friends would dress in the tightest clothes, drink in excess, and be very sexually forward with the men they wanted attention from. Then, the next morning, wonder what they did wrong and why he isn’t texting them back. Stop talking about sex. Women in college will talk about sex in front of men, about blow jobs, about funny stories from one night stands. It drives men crazy, and successfully gets those women all the attention in the room. But if you want marriage someday, being wanted isn’t good enough. It feels good to be looked at and lusted after by men, and it can be intoxicating. I know, trust me. But you’re appealing to the wrong dating strategy. Delete tinder. Stop snap chatting your body. Be beautiful, and someday you’ll be wanted in a different way, for a lifetime not just a good time. And that is... extraordinary. 

I’m realizing how long this post has become. I have many more things to say, and if you’d like I can make a part 2, 3, etc. 

I hope you all have a lovely day.

911iht,Malleability and You,"Women are resilient. [Evolution has shaped us](https://therationalmale.com/2011/10/03/war-brides/) to endure life's harsh realities and continue on.

You may be asking yourself: *How does this relate to sexual strategy?*

Understanding the elements of masculinity and femininity is important in the relationship context because a relationship *flourishes* when the masculine and feminine elements are *complementary* rather than competing.

You *combine* with your partner to amplify each other's qualities whereas [opposites cancel each other out](http://archive.is/SoNYA). It is women's *malleability* that allows this combination to occur. 

[Masculinity is an active, creative force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrxQ4M3EOo) with femininity it's nurturing receptive complement. While RP men are encouraged to create a vision for their life, RP women are encouraged to create themselves in a manner that supports their men. 

A man who has fully embraced his masculinity would only consider a woman relationship-worthy if she's able to complement his goals. This can mean she must be willing to transform herself in a manner that allows her to enter into his life seamlessly, joining him on his path. 

Feminine energy is fluid — like water: a ""soft landing"", yielding, receptive, graceful, **adaptable**, restorative, and life-giving. Feminine traits men say they love:

* Submissive, pleasant

* Sexually enthusiastic

* Childlike qualities (vulnerable, trusting, innocence, wonder)

**All these traits are considered desirable because of implied malleability**. A woman with these traits can follow her man's lead, adapting her focus towards him and his goals. Women who demonstrate feminine traits without adaptability (ie: holding back, refusing to change), are only appealing in the short term, or not at all.

The more masculine the man, the more he will feel an innate *need* to shape his woman, guiding her and raising her up to walk his path with him. A woman's willingness to transform gives her the power to calm his volatile nature and allow them as a couple to create the stable foundation for a thriving relationship.

Let’s get started.

***

Tl;dr: It’s impossible for him to not look and hard to forget what he’s seen.  

&amp;nbsp;

When we say that men are visual, this means that men are instinctively pulled towards live and recollected images of women.  As a woman it might be hard to understand this. **Regardless of whether or not they want it, the wiring of the male brain creates a instinctive pull to visually consume the image of an attractive woman. These images can be live or recollections and are just as alluring either way.** 

This comes up for men in two ways. The first is when a woman who is dressed to show off a great body. This woman is an eye magnet and it is difficult for a man to avoid noticing her. Even when he he doesn’t look, he is *acutely aware of her presence*. The second is through mental image files that every man keeps. Even when an eye magnet woman is not *present* every man has a mental file of images that can intrude without warning *or* be called up at will. 



&amp;nbsp;


###What every woman should know about the visual wiring of men. 

Both looking and remembering are related to a type of brain wiring that is almost universal among men (*some women may have it too, but not most*). 

**A man’s brain structure and chemical mix wire him to be visually oriented**. This makes him more likely to perceive attractive images as sexual. **It triggers an initial reaction that is instinctive and automatic**. From there he can chose to apply willpower on how he will behave. 

The response comes from the part of the brain that controls unconscious processes such as digestion and breathing. It is the part that lights up when you are hungry and see a buffet. In this scenario, you will notice and be drawn towards the food on a gut level *then* your conscious thoughts and will power kick in *from a different part of the brain*. Clinical studies show these same processes at work when a man sees a woman dressed in an attractive manner. **He will be automatically drawn to her before having the conscious thought to pull away.** 

This is hard to understand because women do not activate the same part of the brain at the sight of an attractive man. When *we* see an attractive man, our *thinking* centers light up. And we *think* “he’s an attractive man”. From the onset, ours is a *thinking* response. This makes it difficult for women to understand the automatic and reflexive nature of a man’s response to sexy stimuli.

&amp;nbsp;

###Compulsion One: A man can’t *not* notice

&gt; From the surveys: Imagine you are sitting alone in a train station and a woman with a great body walks in and stands in line. What is your reaction?

98% of men respond that they cannot **not** notice. While only 4% say that they will openly stare and drool, 76% are drawn to sneak a peak and 18% are acutely aware that the woman is there and struggle not to look. Only 2% of men have no reaction. 

These results are the same across demographics. **Nearly all men describe having difficult not looking when they are exposed to a sexy woman**.  

&amp;nbsp;

###Compulsion Two: A man has a mental photo file of sensual images

We know from chapter 6 that men think about sex a lot. What we might not realize is that they aren’t thinking about this in words (“I’d like to have sex tonight”) rather they have a sensual picture in their head. 

These pictures can be of us, their loving wives and girlfriends but not always. Sometimes, these can be images that are burned into their brains from what they’ve seen out in the world. 

At times these mental pictures can be memories of you. Other times they are memories of a woman he saw walking down the street three weeks ago. Still other times it can be a Playboy magazine he read three months back. *One man claimed to have an unending supply of pictures in his head stretching back to his teens.* 

&gt; From the surveys: Many men have a set of sensual images that rise up or can be conjured up in their minds, does this apply to you?”  

Only 25% of men say that they do not have a set of mental images. The remainder claim that they do have those pictures in their head and they can either be recent or from years gone by. **A full 87% of men say that these images regularly pop up in their minds**.  

This is so different from how women experience the world that the author’s husband didn’t believe her when she told him this doesn’t happen to her. He thought she was embarrassed to admit the truth, and couldn’t believe her until a group of women shared her denial. *We truly are wired differently!*

&amp;nbsp;

###Why these pictures pop up

There is a shortcut for certain types of memories that bypasses the thinking centers of the brain. It is traced to the amygdala which is the part that acts as a repository for the memories that are tied to gut level responses.  The instinctive reaction to a provocatively dressed woman is exactly the sort of gut level memory that is stored away in the amygdala. **These visceral images are able to bypass thinking and simply pop back up in his mind.** 

We, women, might experience something similar with emotions which is what our brains are wired to process. If you’ve had emotional memories pop up unexpectedly (or unwantedly) then you understand what these picture-memories are for men 

Now, imagine what the sex saturated culture must be like. The act of living today can be a minefield for a man who doesn’t want these images in his brain or a smorgasbord for a man who does. Husband listened to this chapter with me and jumped in at this point: 

&gt; Yes! It’s all over. I mean, YOGA PANTS! And at the gym, some women don’t even wear underwear!!

Men told the author that these sexual thoughts or images barge into their brain *all the time*. Of course, we want to know what ""all the time"" means and one man describes it like this: 

&gt;If you are talking about a teenage boy all the time means **all. the. time**. It can be every few hours and last for a half hour before the thought passes. For a 20 something man it is still pretty frequent. Once men reach their 30s an onward  it is less frequent and more often triggered by something. Once those thoughts are triggered, the man has to make a great effort to tear them down if he wants to. The longer he entertains the image, the harder it is to get rid of. 

**These thoughts are both normal and have no bearing on a man’s devotion to his relationship**. 

&amp;nbsp;

###How it works

**Step 1**: *For every man sensual images &amp; thoughts arise involuntarily.* Men have the thoughts whether they want them or not. If the stimulus is there so is the response. It might not even register to the man that he had the thought until a second or two after it occurs. 

  *Try this thought experiment to understand how it works*.

 &gt;Imagine walking into a classroom and seeing these words on the board: *Don’t Read This*  

 &gt; I tell you, “no really, don’t read it, just look at the letters”. Did you not read it? 

 &gt; That is what it’s like for a guy. His brain reads “Nice Body” just like you read “don’t read this”.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 2**: *Every man’s involuntary physical impulse is to enjoy the feelings associated with the thoughts and images*. Because men are hardwired to be sexual hunters, every thought &amp; image associated with that pursuit comes with powerful feelings. 

 **When a sensual image enters a man’s mind, it brings a rush of temporary pleasure. This initial physical sensation is involuntary.** 

 The author relays a story. When her son was 4 years old, he stopped in front of the Victoria Secret store and he stared in awe. When his parents asked him what he was doing, he pointed and said *“I like those ladies, their bare tummies make my tummy feel good”*. At four, he was *obviously* too young to understand sex, but he still had a male brain and thus the same reaction as all men. 

 A married man describes the physical sensation to the author: 

 &gt;When an image plays on a man’s brian or he gazes at an attractive woman, it’s not just pure lust. There is a thrill there. A man can go back to that adrenaline rush by entertaining those images. 

 **The feeling is both enticing and difficult to resist.** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 3:** *Every man can make a choice to dwell on the images and thoughts or dismiss them*. Many men make the decisions to strike down these unwanted mental pictures. The biggest factor in whether a man made this choice was whether or not he regularly attended religious services. Because religion’s demand mental purity, those men disciplined themselves to stop looking. 

&amp;nbsp;

###Reassurances for the wives and girlfriends

* **ONE** He probably wishes he could reserve his visual nature just for you. Most men said they enjoy being visual but would reserve it entirely for their partners if they could. They don’t love the distraction that today’s images regularly throw at him. 

* **TWO** He can see a beautiful woman without *sexual* temptation. The temptation to look often isn’t sexual. A lot of it is about admiring beauty. 

* **THREE** Every man is different and discipline makes a difference. Each man experiences a different level of temptation. For some it’s a small nuisance and for some it’s a stumbling block. Have you ever struggled to not eat a piece of cake?  Some women will have an easier time turning away while others will have an internal struggle.

* **FOUR** It’s not because of you. Some of us may wonder, *What is wrong with me? Am I not attractive enough?* This truly is something that every man experiences and has little to do with you. Love your husband as a man. This is a part of what makes him a man. Even if you were a model, your husband would still experience these images. 

* **FIVE**. This doesn't impact his feelings for you. The biological temptation has no impact on a man’s feelings for his SO. There is no competition between his wife and the woman who catches his eye. It is truly just an observation of the other woman. 

&amp;nbsp;

###What’s a woman to do? 

**In short, nothing. Do not be alarmed and try to change your man**. Do not hound or punish your man for his wiring. Just as we expect our men to not dwell on these thoughts, he should be able to expect us to not dwell on our insecurities. If you feel worry rising up remember that this is one of element of male-ness. **You will not find a man who isn’t wired this way**. 


&gt; A churchgoing man speaks: “I wish my wife would accept the struggle I have with lust and encourage me rather than freak out and conclude the worst about me. The more I can reveal my weakness without being judged or accused or without a major crisis in our relationship resulting from my transparency the more I know I am loved for who I am and not for who she wants me to be”. 

*Do we love the men in our lives for who they are or for who we want them to be? Do we want to support our men or change them?* 

The only person you can change is yourself. If you find your man noticing other women, handle it with maturity and grace *even if it makes you uncomfortable*. **It is destructive to become hurt and suspicious when it’s not warranted. Be a support and a soft place to land.** If you aren’t safe to talk to, he won’t talk to you. 

Notice and appreciate his efforts to not look. If you pay attention, you’ll see how often he is exposed to attractive women and sexy images. Love him for the effort he makes not to look. Sometimes, commenting on the woman (*”Hey, she was pretty*”) will relieve his stress at the effort not to notice. 

&amp;nbsp;

The author, coming from a Christian background, recommends that now that you understand how men view the world, you consider respecting *men* by dressing in a  modest manner. Men find it hard to believe that women don’t realize what they are doing when they dress in a provocative manner. Because our brains are not wired in the same way, *many women do not realize*. The imagines in men’s heads come from somewhere and we can help not provide those images to men who do not want them. We may think we look cute but he’s instinctively picturing us naked. Religious men in particular struggle to keep their thoughts pure and you in a short skirt isn’t helping. 

While *I* don’t personally ascribe to her beliefs, I *do* believe that if you are going to dress in a sexy and attention grabbing manner (and ladies this includes anything from downright trashy to the pencil skirt that hugs your butt at work), then you *cannot* get upset with your man for taking a peak at another girl on the street. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Love and understand your man rather than letting your own insecurities punish him for something he cannot control**

90ehqv,It works...! Just got engaged to the perfect man for me.,"Hello! I wanted to share some happy news with the community, because I feel the information espoused here has contributed so much to my life. My amazing boyfriend has proposed! This was not altogether a surprise, although the precise timing and circumstances and ring were wonderful surprises! The experience so far has been everything I've dreamed.

In every relationship prior to this one, I had been a sullen, chronically dissatisfied, disrespectful and frankly at times mean lil' brat. I would oscillate between craving my boyfriends' love --turning into a needy, pouty, clingy sex kitten-- and considering myself somehow ""too special"" for them --ignoring their thoughts, needs, lives.

My fiance, though, inspired a new deep respect in me that led to a lot of changes - one of which was finding this forum and taking its advice to heart! Change, to my happy surprise, is possible. It's hard, but it's possible, and the rewards are so sweet.

I'm so excited to continue working on my humility, my patience, my devotion and my respect.

8zvaif,I love him but...,"A common RPW post goes like this: 

&gt; I’ve been with this guy for X amount of time. These are all the things that are going wrong in the relationship. He’s doing x, y and z and I want to change that. I love him very much how do I change myself so he’s better. 

I commend the women who look to themselves first for the root of the problem but I cringe every time I see “I love him very much”. It’s a line that gets put into so many posts and I have a secret for you.

Love isn’t enough.

Men have two things that they require like air: [respect]( https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cnh7l/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2/) and [sex]( https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8o2dtb/for_women_only_sex_chapter_6/). 

Don’t misunderstand, love is important and everyone wants to be loved. However, your love must be demonstrated through the lens of respect. Furthermore, respect is often necessary for *us* to feel attraction to a man. After all, who wants to let someone into her bed who she doesn’t respect? Who wants to care for a manchild for the rest of her life? Who here wants to *lead* the relationship? 

Love changes over time. In the beginning, infatuation is a fire and it’s all consuming. These feelings fade as a relationship becomes comfortable. Love deepens and is a shared bond that can sustain you for life. That love requires you to think highly of the man you love. It goes beyond hormones and passion. 

That love is also easily confused with habit and attachment when a relationship is on the line. 

Often I see “I love him very much” along with a list of his faults. What that really means is: “I’m very comfortable in this relationship and I don’t want to start over”. 

You can care deeply about someone and not respect them. If you do not respect a man the relationship isn’t sustainable. So instead of attempting to identify “love” for a man, ask yourself if you respect him. Does your gut tell you that you would follow him into a fire? Forgo your path to join him on his? Will you proudly show off your relationship to friends and family without omission? Do you think he knows where he’s going in life and will you stay by his side through thick and thin? 

Love isn’t enough. There *must* also be respect for the relationship to survive.

8ww90e,"The Cult of ""Self-Esteem""","A while back, some revolutionary thinker in the field of psychology noticed that *some people think that they are pretty cool, and others don't*. This astonishing revelation was heralded by trumpet fanfare and a new fad sweeping the psychological community (which should tell you something about the average intellectual calibre of that profession). 

Today, while the professionals have largely moved on to other, even stupider, things, this concept has lingered on in the popular concept of what psychology is, largely because it is easy to grasp, easy to explain things with, and impossible to predict anything with and thereby be proven wrong. This allows otherwise useless people to feed themselves by writing articles for Cosmo, and people who know nothing about anything to sound smarter than they are during casual conversation. 

And where you encounter the words ""self-esteem"", you almost invariably encounter the word ""women"". 

In fact, aliens reading random samples of earth's modern printed material could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking that ""women's self-esteem"" was our most precious resource, which we use to catalyze working nuclear fusion reactors, or distill to cure cancer, or something. 

In fact, a lot of humans, who live on earth and should know better, seem to believe this as well. It always makes me smile when I am accused by some outraged feminist or tradcon, of ""trying to lower women's self-esteem"", often with the codicil ""so they will be easy prey for men"". (*At which point she glances backwards to find a soft spot, faints dramatically , smelling salts are fetched, and a good time is had by all.*)

Technically, of course, they are absolutely right. What they, and pretty much anyone else, have never thought about, however, is a simple question: **What makes everyone so sure that having the highest possible self-esteem is good for you?**

No one ever explained that to you, did they? They just took it as their starting point. *Obviously* a high self-esteem is good, and a higher self-esteem is better, so here's how you go about convincing yourself that you are best thing evaaar. 

Well, yes, this *is* obvious, and like about 50% of obvious things, it's also dead wrong. 

If you look at successful and happy people, you'll find they all have high self-esteem. That's why people are tempted to conclude that high self-esteem makes you successful and happy. This, of course, is backwards. Being happy and successful gives you high self-esteem, and it doesn't work the other way at all. 

When you start to think about it this way, it becomes clear. [This](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/df/5e/9d/df5e9dd6aab05b5e31961000bbf5c10f--gorgeous-redhead-beautiful-women.jpg) girl obviously thinks she's beautiful, because she has access to a mirror, and her eyes work. But if [this](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/amy-schumer.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=563&amp;crop=1) ... whatever that is... believes the same thing, will she be happy? 

She will persistently wonder why nothing ever seems to work out like she expects. 

**In practice, self-esteem is not like wealth (more is better), but like insulin: Too little will hurt you, but so will too much.**

We live in a society and era where the male ego is systematically starved (and then called ""fragile"" when it exhibits signs of that starvation), while the female ego is fed, and fed, and then force-fed some more with a tube down its throat as if we were trying to produce *foie gras*. This means that, while both too much *or* too little self-worth is bad for both men and women, **the most common self-esteem problem that women face is ""having too much of it""**.

This leads women to chronic disappointment, envy of others, and most importantly, to making really bad moves in their efforts to get and keep the best relationship they can. 

In my next article here, we'll discuss how to detect low and high self-esteem problems.

8w5sfx,A Field Guide to Retarded Bullshit,"&gt; Theres so much of information out there, so many gurus telling you to do 'X' so 'Y' will definitely happen. So many websites teaching you the behaviour of a High Value Woman... there is this one thing almost all the Gurus teach. ""By not caring for the relationship, you hold the most power""... ""Do not care, be busy, be high value"" mantra is blatantly taught by all the big names ( Brian Nox, even Sherry Argov... in their bestselling books. 

Well, congratulations, lady, you just answered your own question. 

In. Their. Bestselling. Books. 

When you go to Brian Nox's website, [here](https://imgur.com/a/55dhdp2) is the first thing you see. Scroll down a bit and you get to read this:

&gt;&gt; Some men are silly to say the least. They don’t treat women with the respect they deserve in relationships, at work and even in their family lives. Sure, not all men are like this, but you might have noticed life is not always easy, as a woman.

&gt;&gt;I’m on a personal mission to change that. Being a man I get why men do what they do. Consider me your “insider” who is not afraid to share the truth about men and their ‘interesting’ behaviors. I share important strategies with women that will help them get what they deserve, in their love life, in their career, wherever they need it.

Yeah, right. Mr. Brian Nox, your personal white knight, is going to *treat you with the respect you deserve*, by giving you inside information on how *men are silly* and what you should do to get *everything you deserve* from them. 

*Just click here to buy his book.*

I swear, if I ever get sick enough of working for a living to be willing to sacrifice my self-respect, I will take a fifty milligram dose of ondansetron hydrochloride, and start penning *""Coughing Up The Red Pill: How I Rejected Misogyny and Discovered Women are Wonderful""*, full of every platitude I can think of about how women are perfect, how anything they do wrong is men's fault, how they deserve a Nobel Prize and a Congressional Medal of Honor just for breathing, and how it is morally imperative that every man they encounter should devote his entire existence to satisfying their every whim, but never dare to speak in their presence unless given permission. 

Then I will buy a small Caribbean island, have a palace built on it, and never do any work again, unless flinging the ice from my martini glass off the balcony counts as ""watering the lawn"". 

Because hordes of women will buy enough copies to kill a small forest, then read the first three chapters and collapse on the sofa in a drugged-out stupor of ego-gratification, oblivious to the babble of daytime television or the fact that their bag of potato chips has spilled into their unwashed hair. 

In case my real point isn't totally fucking obvious, **anyone who makes money giving women relationship advice is really being paid to tell women what they want to hear**. 

It must be quite tough to be a woman sometimes (and here I am no longer being sarcastic), because women are constantly surrounded by a perfect storm of misinformation, blowing from overprotective busybodies, and dudes who will say anything if they think they'll get laid. 

Let's face it: **If good relationship advice for women affirmed what they already wanted to hear, they wouldn't need any. They'd already know it.** 

All growth, by definition, happens outside your comfort zone. This is common sense. If you want better results than you have ever had, you are going to have to learn things you have never known, think things you have never thought, and try things you have never done. 

**If advice tastes good on your tongue, spit it out. It's full of sugar and it will make you fat.** Anyone can make long lists of what they they deserve, and seek out people they can pay to agree with them. But if you think you deserve something, and the world isn't offering it to you, then it has a different opinion of what you deserve. 

And you can work hard to change yourself, or you can pay people to tell you the world is mistaken. Guess which one of these will get you what you want?

8vxrw8,"Thank you, Ladies! From a very long time lurker.","My whole young life I was a pretty shitty woman. In retrospect, every relationship I ever had was based soley on my need for an emotional conquest over others. Or for personal validation. I didn't want a man, I wanted a heart receptacle. Many a night was spent anguishing over my failed attempts to secure one rather than examining all the toxic stuff I was doing.


Then I found Redpill. Your posts forced me to begrudgingly take a look at myself, and my lifestyle. 




Over the last few years and with your ideology in mind I cut the crap and started exploring who I was alone. I focused on school, got my looks together, and started a business that I believe in instead of chasing yet another self serving ""relationship."" That was a hugely rewarding challenge. 



I didn't date for a long time as I delved into the roots of my bad habits. I forced myself to read old cringey messages, dripping with ugly need, that I'd sent to ex's. It opened my eyes to how shortsighted, selfish and unfair I'd been to EVERY single man in my life. I never wanted to be like that again. 



I also realized that my deeply submissive ""bedroom"" self was just the woman inside me trying to seek light. I began cooking both for the joy of it and for my family, started taking actual pleasure in cleaning, and found a feminine love of presentation and decor that I didn't know existed. 3 years ago I lived in a dumpster. Now people audibly wonder how I pulled my home together. All it took was having pride in womanhood rather than shame over the possibility of domestic contentment. 



All these efforts culminated into a self that I was ready to share, and about 9 months ago I met a fellow entrepreneur with whom I hit it off with. We're in a relationship now!


I focus only on facts, or on him, his efforts, and his work. Never feelings. He takes genuine interest in me and my interests, surprises me with silly gifts or treats that make me smile (which I would have declined in the past due to bullshit principals), and tells me nearly every day that he appreciates the few free moments we can spend together. Probably because they aren't filled with me saying ""why can't we hang out more, I'm sad, blah blah."" He isn't preparing for an emotional battle every day when he gets home, and that has allowed us to connect on a much more intimate and personal level than I've ever experienced. 


So basically I've never had such a wonderful life or relationship and it's all because I stopped whining and started listening to you folks. So thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, all of you, for going against the grain and encouraging me through your existence to take this journey on. It's paid off in spades.

8v87iu,How do you know if you’re boring?,"I feel a little silly asking this, but quite a few posts say that a boring personality can really turn a guy off. So how do you know if you’re boring or not?  

I live a slightly dull life, but I enjoy the simple things: reading, cooking healthy (but I eat the same thing a lot) going to the gym, etc. I’m naturally introverted and a little shy when first meeting people because I enjoy one-on-one conversations on deep subjects. I’m very open minded to trying new things, but otherwise I stick to a pretty repetitive and low key routine focused on self improvement. People could perceive this as boring. 

So what’s a good indicator to measure boring-ness? Not having plans every weekend? Not having wild and colorful experiences? Being forgettable?

8q38q8,RP truths vs Feminism -- I need some encouragement!,"Hi everyone, I just need to go on a little rant if that's alright with you. Please let me know if you've ever felt the same and how you come to terms with this.

So, like a lot of us here:

Literally EVERYONE around me has always been supportive of feminism. I am  in academia and anything that doesn't automatically spew out feminist ideals is INTENSELY frowned upon. I grew up thinking I should focus on my career and that I should be powerful and competitive and never EVER trust any man and never EVER let go.

I've been in a LTR with the same wonderful man for over 11 years now and am 28 so I didn't mess things up in terms of what RPW teaches. I love him so much and feel privileged and lucky to have met him so young and stayed with him. Ever since I found TRP and RPW (3 years ago) I have always 'accepted' RP truths and became obsessed with these sub reddits and the relevant blogs. 

However, I kind of saw it as a sideline thing. Almost like a... I know it is not purely sexual but almost like a 'kink'... Something that you have a great attraction towards but it doesn't mean you want to completely change your life and relationship in that direction. It just felt like a delicious rebellion against feminism, which always felt oppressive to me. So reading these things were a relief.  


But I obviously I ended up changing things in my life bit by bit: started acting and feeling more feminine, stopped competing with men.... never wanted children and am now seriously considering it.... I have lost weight... I am working out daily.... I STFU... I am trying to make my partner's life better in every way I can...I have been cooking for him and cleaning more.... I am much more comfortable with sex now that I understand the dynamics a bit better.    


I feel like I am finally figuring out what it means to be a woman... and damn it.. IT FEELS GOOD! It feels right. It is liberating to not be angry and being told I am an oppressed victim all the time. It feels amazing not to have to compete and be tense 24/7. Also, my relationship is much better. My SO is so happy and my changes are causing amazing changes in him too and I'm so excited for the future!  


But the fact that RP truths feels so right is disturbing to me, right now. I am just scared that maybe it is all true. Maybe we are in fact different from each other, men and women. Maybe women do really crave leadership. Maybe we do love feeling beautiful. 

I'm just worried as I let go into this that there is in fact a patriarchy and that I am being internally misogynistic by acting in RP relevant ways. Has anyone here ever felt the same fears? How did you deal with them?  

You know, ironically, feminism teaches us that femininity (or feminine characteristics) in its traditional sense is inferior and laughable. And as I accept my femininity more and more. I can't  help but to feel like now I am inferior. Less relevant.   


It's just amazing that it takes a community labeled as misogynistic to make me accept my femininity and womanhood.   


I'm just scared that I am missing something  at some point here. Do the feminists see something I'm not seeing? Do they have it right?  


I appreciate this might not be the right place to discuss feminism but I am sure people here must have had some inner conflict too. Please let me know how you worked it out! Thanks :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8q38q8/rp_truths_vs_feminism_i_need_some_encouragement/,1528659368.0,64,0.91,57,RedPillWomen,BlueberrySea
8puhqx,Clarifying strength - alpha vs empty confidence,"I’m in a very serious relationship with the most wonderful man, we have talked about long term plans, and he has communicated that he knows I’m the “one.” 

I had a conversation with him last night that helped me clarify to both myself and him a few things about strong men. I think it might help some of you too. 

He earned a bachelors degree in economics but felt like he wasn’t being challenged, so decided to get a second degree in computer science. He’s in the hardest classes at the university, taking a heavy course load to graduate in one year, and for the first time in his life, he’s feeling like he’s not the smartest guy in the room. He’s working long long nights, competing with people who have been coding for ten years longer than him, and he’s beginning to worry he’s out of his league.

He’s had a hard few months, and yesterday was especially rough. We talked for a while, and by the end, he was apologizing to me for “complaining” and mentioned it probably wasn’t very attractive or masculine to tell me he’s feeling like a failure. He said he probably shouldn’t come talk to me at all, that he doesn’t like to feel weak in front of me. 

I stopped him right there. I know we are driven by evolution to seek a successful strong man, and men are driven to provide. But I was witnessing in front of my eyes my man’s growth, he was figuring out what he’s capable of, pushing his limits, and discovering who he is and what he wants in life. And ladies, that is a gift. I told him that I admire endlessly the strength it takes for him to pursue something so difficult, with the intention of making a better life for us and our family. And to me, there’s nothing more masculine and alpha than being able to admit your fears, insecurities, and limitations to the woman you love, and to bear the challenge anyway. 

There is nothing weak about it. Weakness hides within the empty confidence of many of these self proclaimed alpha men we’ve all encountered at the bars and elsewhere. The men who are all talk, all game, and no substance to back it up. 

Be a woman your man can come to on days like this. Be a woman who believes in him, encourages him, and trusts him with your future, even when he’s lost or unsure. Hold on to him, reassure him, and be there for him, in whatever way he needs. 

Find a man with the character, not the salary, of a successful man. He’s only 22, and I have the utmost confidence in his ability to achieve whatever he wants in life. He has ambition, a powerful work ethic, humility, integrity, and a high capacity for sacrifice and ability to lead. He is my captain, and I couldn’t be more proud of him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8puhqx/clarifying_strength_alpha_vs_empty_confidence/,1528566444.0,74,0.92,11,RedPillWomen,kittxxn

Let’s get started.

***

Tl;dr: Your sexual desire for your man profoundly affects his sense of wellbeing and confidence in all areas of his life. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all know that men want more sex. Unless you and your SO have *incredibly* mismatched libidos, it’s a safe bet that your man wants more sex. What we don’t often realize, is how strongly a man feels this need or why. This chapter explores just how important sex is to men and more importantly **what sex means for men and why it is so important**. 

The author was unsurprised to find an *urgent theme* that arose from her surveys: men want more sex. What she discovered when men opened up more is that men believe that women don’t understand that this need is a crisis for both the man and the relationship. 

Women who understand that men need sex, tend to view it as a physical need. It is not hard to come to terms with that idea. What we miss is how much emotion men attach to sex. **Though there is certainly a physical component, sex fills a powerful emotional need**. And, because men don’t describe sexual needs in emotional terms, we often don’t realize it. **The lack of sex is as emotionally serious to him as his sudden silence would be to us. It is just as wounding and just as much a legitimate grievance.** 

Remember all the previous chapters where we talked about men’s insecurity, feelings of inadequacy, the burden they feel? A man can feel isolated and burdened by these feelings that he never discusses. Sex assures him that he is desirable. It eases the loneliness and allows him to face the world with confidence. He cannot feel completely loved without it.

&amp;nbsp;

*In his heart, he wants to be wanted.*

&amp;nbsp;

To explore this idea further, the author asks the following survey question

&gt; Q: Regarding sex: with some men it is sufficient to be sexually gratified whenever he wants, for others it is also important to feel sexually wanted and desired by your wife. *How important to you is it to feel wanted by your wife?* 

&amp;nbsp;

The question gets to the nature of sex. If it is the act itself, then men should be happy as long as they are receiving as much sex as they want. However, less than 1% claimed that feeling wanted was irrelevant as long as he got enough sex and only 2% said that it wasn’t very important to feel wanted. A full 66% said it was very important and an additional 31% said that it was somewhat important. **For most men, the sex act alone is insufficient**.

It’s unlikely that we women are intentionally withholding something that we know is critical to our partner’s well being. What is more likely is that women don’t realize the emotional consequences of our responses, or lack of them. We perceive the desire for sex as a physical desire or if we’re being cranky and unkind, an insensitive demand. For the sake of our relationships, it’s important to understand the truth behind our men’s advances.

&amp;nbsp;

###Why is sex so important?

In the surveys two trends emerge. The first considers the benefits of fulfilling sex and the second the hindrance that rejection creates. 

Across the board, men reported that having regular mutually enjoyed sex life was critical to their feeling of being loved and desired. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I wish that my wife understood that making a priority of meeting my intimacy needs is the loudest and clearest way she can say *“you are more important to me than anything else in the world”*. It is a form of communication that speaks more forcefully with less room for misinterpretation than any other.

&amp;nbsp;

Many men, even those with close friendships, seem to live with a deep sense of loneliness that is foreign to us women. Making love is a balm for that loneliness. It means there is one other person in this world he can be completely vulnerable with and not judged. 

Fulfilling sex gives him confidence. As we touched on in ‘imposter’ chapter, most men ask themselves “do I measure up”. Our support and affirmations help our men to feel confident of their place in the world. Sex is just an extension of this idea. Your desire is a bedrock form of support that helps him face his daily life with confidence and wellbeing. Men are more confident and alive when their sex life is active and rewarding. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Q: imagine your wife was an interested and motivated sexual partner and you therefore had an active love life, how would having sex with her as often as you wanted, affect your emotional state? 

&amp;nbsp;

About a quarter of the men surveyed (23%) said that sex is unrelated to emotions or how he felt about the rest of his life. For these men sex on demand would have little to no impact on his life. However, the remainder, a full 77% said that it would have a positive effect and that he’d have a greater sense of well being and satisfaction with life. Ask yourself, what is the likelihood that my man is in the minority? 

Men tell us this all the time, but again, because they don’t speak in emotional terms, we *hear* the man code for this fact but we don’t understand what he’s actually saying. When he says he feels better when he has more sex, it’s easy to assume that he means it in a purely physical way. This is wrong, men repeatedly tell the author. They feel better and life feels better when they are getting enough active and mutually appealing sex. Put simply, it helps release life’s pressures and makes everything *feel* better.

&amp;nbsp;

###What happens when he doesn’t get it?

&gt; If she doesn't want to, I feel incredible rejection. 

&amp;nbsp;

Most men would rather do onerous tasks than have sex with a woman who is responding out of duty. The guy isn’t going to be rejected by his chores whereas duty sex feels like a rejection. 

If you are responding because you have to, he knows it, and feels the sting of rejection. Remember that what he wants most is to be desired. If you agree to roll around in bed, but once you get there, you aren't engaged, he isn’t going to view it as something you do out of love.  He hears *“You are incapable of turning me on even if you try and what is most important to you, isn’t important to me”.* If you flat out reject him with say, the standard: *I’m tired honey*,  he hears *“You re so undesirable, you can’t even compete with my pillow, and I don’t care about what matters deeply to you”.* 

**None of us *mean* this of course. It doesn’t always matter what we mean, what he hears and feels are the pill that must be swallowed here**.  We may just be saying *I don’t want sex at this moment”*, but he hears that you don’t want him and that is painful. 

&amp;nbsp;

###Men Speak: 

&gt; She doesn’t understand that I feel loved by sexual caressing and if she doesn’t want to, I feel incredible rejection.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; “No” is not no to sex, as she may feel, it is no to me as I am and I am vulnerable as I ask or initiate. It’s plain and simple rejection.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; She doesn’t understand that even her occasional dismissals make me feel less desirable. I can’t resist her. I wish that I too were irresistible. She says I am but her ability to say no so easily makes it’s hard to believe.

&amp;nbsp;

The feeling of rejection and the feeling that his wife doesn’t really desire him can lead a man to dark places. One only needs to visit the other RP subreddits to see the impact these rejections have on men. 

**Your lack of desire can send him into depression**. If your desire gives him a sense of well being and confidence, then you can understand how the opposite holds true as well. The ongoing perception of a lack of desire will translate to a nagging lack of confidence, withdrawal and depression. 

Men scoffed at the author’s push back. *A string of rejections doesn't necessarily mean she is rejecting you as a man* say women, *We are tired, we work too and care for the house and the kids. Just because we don’t want sex, doesn’t mean we don’t want you.* Men warn us back: *Any woman sending those signals will undermine the loving environment she most wants because she’ll have one depressed man on her hands*. 

If you still can’t wrap your head around it, the author compares men’s need for sex to women’s need for talking and communication. Men can’t turn off the physical and emotional importance of sex. Regularly turning him down feels the same to him as his sudden silence would feel to you. Imagine how you’d feel if your husband didn’t talk to you anymore, or acted as though connecting with you through conversation was something he did out of duty. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; We’ve been married for along time, I deeply regret and resent the lack of intimacy of nearly any kind for the duration of our marriage. I feel rejected, ineligible, insignificant, lonely, isolated and abandoned as a result. Not having the interaction that I anticipated prior to marriage is like a treasure, lost and irretrievable it causes deep resentment and hurt within me. This in turn fosters anger and feelings alienation. 

&amp;nbsp;

###How can we overcome the sex gap? 

We must choose to love him in the way he needs. If you are viewing his need as physical, that is, important, but perhaps options, then you must stop and wrap your head around this chapter right away! When viewed this way, it’s too easy to make the argument that your need for sleep is just as important as his need for sex. 

If you realize that he’s actually saying *“this is essential to my feeling of being loved and desired and to counteract my feelings of stress and loneliness”* your response should be very different. It is always ideal to respond to his invitation with your full emotional and physical involvement, knowing that you are touching his heart. 

However, there are going to be times when you realistically *cannot* manage sexual intimacy with your partner. If you must say no, say with with words from the heart. Make sure that you are being reassuring, reaffirming and adoring. Leave him in no doubt that you love to love him. Through in the fact that you desire him for good measure. Promise to show him later if you can.  

And if you say no in a way that reassures him, it can be better than saying yes and then engaging in emotionally detached starfish sex. If you respond physically but without meeting his need to be engaged and desired, STOP! If you are having sex with him, be engaged, you aren’t meeting his needs otherwise. 

**You must take an active role in sex**. Many men want a wife who is sexually motivated. TRP and the Christian men that the author interviewed agree. Men want their women to be *his slut*. The religious men are *slightly* more circumspect. They say they want: * a girl next door in the living room but a wildcat in the bedroom*. This means you should make the first move from time to time and bring all you attention and passion for you man into bed with you. 

**Make sex a priority**. Ask yourself, are the needs you are meeting the needs he wants met? Does he care about the dishes getting done or does he care about sex? Don’t focus as much on what you want to get done at the expense of your intimate relationship with your SO. Reevaluate your priorities, you can even do this with his help!

*You can be a great wife in every other way, but not doing this one thing that is important to him, and he won’t feel loved.*

8mibxp,A STFU win - and share your own!,"I was so happy with how I handled a really difficult STFU situation, I wanted to share and ask you guys to share your own recent STFU wins. 

STFU can be especially hard (for me) when I'm feeling insecure, jealous, or I just **know** I'm ""right."" I think other women struggle with the same thing maybe? So I was really thankful for my RPW training handling this one...

My fiance is having some drama with his family, including his ex. (They have kids together, and they are from an Eastern culture in which the families remain pretty interlinked, even after divorce.) His ex and their kids have been facing a lot of negative pressure from his family lately, who aren't really treating them well. Because he's a really decent guy, he felt bad for her situation and was encouraging her to take a holiday to visit her brother. He offered to pay for the kids to go along with her, knowing they needed to get away from the negativity. 

Though I was happy to see him getting along with her overall (they have not always been so congenial), it seemed as if she was texting more and more. I started to worry that it was too much, that she was leaning on his support too often - but I fought **hard** against my urge to warn him. I just *knew* that if I let out the negative feelings I was having, I'd come across as jealous, threatened, catty, and selfish - which, honestly, I was feeling. A lot of his time was being consumed with dealing with her, and it was bugging me - even though I kept reminding myself it involved the kids. 

Instead of an argument triggering off, my STFU resulted in him thanking me for being so patient and understanding. And - the kicker?

She finally came on to him via text, told him she still had feelings for him, and wanted to sleep with him (!!!!!). He abruptly told her absolutely no, and that he was not speaking to her again until she got herself under control. **If I had told him it was bound to happen, he wouldn't have believed me, and he would've thought I was overreacting and jealous.** Without a word, I gave her the space to make it clear to him herself, and he learned a valuable lesson without any issues between us.

If anything, he's doubly thankful that I was so supportive and patient throughout the drama. (I didn't even show a dramatic reaction when he told me what she texted him, even though he was a little nervous to tell me - and now I hope he knows he can continue to be honest if her behaviour is shady in the future.

8lvk7q,Back to the basics - SMV,"**Please note - this post is only about SMV. RMV will be covered in another post**

**What is SMV**

SMV stands for sexual market value. There are three components to this phrase, each expressing a different premise. The combination of these three concepts is SMV.

*Sexual* - what matters here is sexual in nature. Other forms of value (such as RMV) may or may not affect your SMV. 

*Market* - sex is a transaction of sorts between a man and a woman. Of course, it's most enjoyable when the transaction element is tucked away and remains unseen, but it's a transaction nonetheless. Just like the foundation of your home is best when it's unseen, but the whole house relies on it, so too is the transaction element of sex. It works best when other elements such as love, desire and passion are what's visible. However, both men and women will become disinterested from sex if it's a one way street where their needs are not being met. This is because sex is a transaction of sorts. **A market is a place where many transactions occur**. (This idea really requires its own post)

*Value* - the topic of value has already been covered [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8chfer/back_to_the_basic_value/)

The sum total of these three concepts is - **you have sexual value to the opposite sex, value which can increase or decrease**. Even people who are in lifelong committed relationships have eyes and can see other people. Therefore, even though they're ""off the market"", sexual value is still valuable and can seriously impact the health of the relationship for good and otherwise. 

**What is sexually valuable**  

What makes something sexually valuable is determined **solely** by what adds sexual value to the opposite sex, causing sexual arousal in members of the opposite sex. If it causes sexual arousal for more people, it has higher sexual value. If it causes a stronger sexual arousal, it has higher sexual value. It makes no difference whatsoever whether you think it's sexy or not, all that matters is whether the opposite sex finds it sexy. 

Female example - there are many women who say - he should desire me for me, as I am. At any size, with any length of hair, with any hair color, with any type of clothing etc. While it sounds idealistic to be desired for the inner you, the physical eyes can't see the inner you and the physical penis goes limp from such displays of the outer you. 

Male example - there are many men who say - I should be able to be soft, emotional and indecisive and I should be sexually desired anyway. While this is idealistic thinking (and has certain manifestations that are good for marriage!), such traits will cause the physical vagina to dry up like the Sahara Desert. 

It doesn't matter what you think is sexually attractive in you, it doesn't even matter if this is good, ideal or moral (TRP being amoral will be covered in another post). All that matters in the world of SMV is - does it have value in the sexual market place? Does this sell and who wants to buy?

**Sexual market fluctuations**

Like any market, value goes up and down based on many factors. Your dollar today isn't worth the same as it was yesterday and it won't remain the same tomorrow. Sometimes it rises, other times it falls. Just like with any product produced by any company - success depends on the value you bring to the table. Sexual success is no different.  

If you generally look good, feel good and smell good, you'll have higher SMV. If one day you're dressed frumpy or you're having a bad hair day, your SMV will be lower that day. If your skin becomes rough, your SMV will be lower, if you apply cream and soften it again, it'll rise up again. After you shower, your SMV will be higher than before the shower. Just like the market fluctuations, your SMV fluctuates as well. The key is that it remain within the realm of normal fluctuation and not enter the realm of volatility. 

When your SMV fluctuates too much it becomes a risky investment. For example - a woman who is a 6 can still attract quite a few men. If she applies a bit of makeup and dresses in the right clothing etc and elevates herself just a bit to a 6 and a half, the man's sexual attraction to her will rise accordingly. It's a win win. However, if she goes through one of those 7 hour long makeup and dress makeovers to the point where she's a different person - sure, she'll get more male attention in the moment, but the moment the clothing and makeup come off, that extra attention will quickly turn to disgust. She may have been able to score the guy if she presented herself genuinely, but the volatility caused by such big highs and lows will cause the value to drop through the floor. (Same is true with any other example for men or women. Imagine a guy who smells really good but that scent is really masking a strong body odor. Your attraction will turn to disgust when the good scent wears off).

**Conclusion** 

SMV is a market filled with fluctuating value. Normal fluctuation is to be expected, drastic fluctuation turns you into a volatile investment that's just too risky to buy. All that matters is what's valuable to the customer. **It's wise to give your partner ample reason to buy into your brand every single day!**

Cheers!

8lf7zl,"A Rule Update - ""Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself""","Ladies and Gentlemen,

I’d like to take some time to discuss one of the [Axioms of RPW](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4g4tf3/axioms_of_rpw/) in light of recent posts. 

&gt; The belief that if you want to have a good partner, you have to be a good partner. This means having some understanding of what men want in a partner, and in particular, what your man wants in a partner, and then using that information to become the best version of yourself you can be. For this reason, self-improvement and self-awareness are fundamental components of RPW.

This is the first axiom on the list and that is because at its heart, all of RP is about self-awareness and self-improvement. An unstated corollary is this: 

**You can only change yourself**

This has been an idea that has been missing in some recent posts. 

First and foremost, you cannot ask for advice on behalf of others. We cannot advise you how to convert your sister, mother, best friend, girlfriend, aunt, niece or second cousin twice-removed to an RPW mindset. No matter how close you are to a woman, you cannot know what is going on in her mind or her relationship. It is a waste of time to try to change someone who is unwilling. We are an open forum, you can send these women to us and we will welcome and advise them, but we will no longer allow posts on someone else’s behalf. 

The second area that this concept needs to be applied is from women asking advice on how to fix their SO. 

There are strategies that *you* can employ to change your own behavior with the intention of altering the dynamics in a relationship. We can offer advice on how to communicate with your SO better, to encourage him to accomplish his goals, to get out of the way so that he can lead or to be the best partner you can be. 

What we cannot do is tell you how to change him. Remember, you can only change yourself. 

If you are approaching a question with the attitude of changing him, we will try to advise you on changing yourself. If we think a situation is hopeless, we will advise you on how to best move on. If you don’t understand his behavior, we can explain men to you.  If you argue that you’ve done no wrong, there is no advice we can give. If you ask: *why isn’t he different*, we will tell you why, but we cannot tell you how to make him be different. 

The mod team will take more care with these sort of posts. We encourage the community to help women reflect on the fact that change originates with her. However, if it becomes clear that a woman is intent on fixing her man, we will shut down the discussion so we aren’t wasting everyone’s time and energy. 

Just as we cannot advise someone on behalf of his sister, we cannot tell you how to tell your SO how to change. 

You are here to make yourself a better woman so that it will spread through your relationship and your life.

“Be the change you want to see in the world” 

Happy Posting!

8l0e48,Modern women choosing traditional masculinity,"Discussion topic. 

Women marry up, men marry down. In modern times, it becomes increasingly difficult for women to settle because women nowadays want a man who has higher level education, higher salary, higher social status. 

I have noticed a trend in a handful of my girlfriends. They are attractive women who have postgraduate degrees, working in white collar jobs with middle to upper middle class salaries, and they have chosen to marry/date a man with traditionally masculine qualities.

By traditionally masculine qualities I mean that these men may not have as high of a salary or even the same level of education, but he has physical strength, street smarts, hands-on skills, social skills, athletic ability, a sense of protection. Typically these men can be found in jobs of law enforcement, military, emergency services, aviation, vocational trades or sports/fitness, essentially jobs that are not so academic but require a different set of skills. They tend to be more ""rough and tumble"" types of men. They have jobs that utilize their testosterone - jobs that require physical strength, aggression, stoicism, or adrenaline. 

I have also noticed with these more traditionally masculine men, they could care less about women's intelligence and appreciate her femininity, domesticity and companionship. For certain modern women, this can be a relief in a world of feminized, neutral gender roles - she can utilize her womanhood and not feel like she has to compete with a man, because **he doesn't care and he is not with her because he expects her to keep up. He treats her like a woman and only expects her softness and feminine qualities.**

*And for some women who feel the pressure to be masculine because of ""equality,"" this is a relief.*

Has anyone noticed this trend? It could be among more conservative cultures, but I find there are some liberal career women who DO choose a man with more traditional values, because she actually wishes for this gender dynamic.

8i2n5c,“Whatever you think is best” really works,"Just wanted to share a little win I had today.

 Currently on my honeymoon and my husband and I were scheduled to have dinner with another couple (friends of ours)  in a Hawaiian town about an hour from where we are staying.

He didn’t really feel like going and it was also an hour away (super inconvenient for us to Uber there) and, although I was worried it would be rude of us to cancel last minute, I remembered what I had read in Surrendered Wife and just said, “Whatever you think is best.”

He decided to cancel it and then we find out that the other couple is having an insanely busy day themselves and secretly didn’t want to host us either.

Can you imagine if I had insisted we go because I was worried about being rude? Not only would it have caused a mild disagreement between us (and loss of intimacy) the other couple would have equally not wanted us there, resulting in four unhappy people.

Now, we get to surf late tonight, get drinks and dinner whenever we feel like it and enjoy a carefree night.

8hfn3c,The nature of support and being supportive,"We often talk about how important it is for a woman to be supportive to the man in her life. But what exactly is the nature of support? Is it just being ""a cheerleader""? Until recently, I assumed the brunt of being supportive fell upon this idea -- of a woman reassuring and encouraging, mainly through her words. 

Recently I have realized this idea I had is *wrong*. 

My boyfriend and I have been repainting, slightly remodelling, and redecorating the kitchen over the past few days. Yesterday evening, we finally got everything done, and while I was making dinner, he cleaned up all the mess we'd made over the past few days. (He had enough time to clean everything because what I was making was quite time-consuming. :P) 

Once dinner was ready and we sat down to eat, he turned to me and thanked me ""for being so supportive. Without you I would have never gotten everything finished today. But seeing you keep working and not give up inspired me to keep going. Otherwise I would have just spend the afternoon playing video games and not finishing anything.""

Not only was this a really sweet moment, it also led me to rethink my idea of what it really means to be supportive. It isn't just giving encouragement (although that is definitely part of it), it's working just as hard alongside him; sharing the work; picking things up where he starts to lag; and making long, boring, annoying tasks more pleasant.

8grzna,Back to the basics - the creation of TRP,"**Important note** \- before I begin, it needs to be acknowledged that a post like this should really be ten miles long and riddled with links to the many studies, news articles and anecdotes that corroborate what's said here. However, this isn't possible for several reasons. Therefore, this post will be a summary of a summary of a summary of what can really be written on this topic, feel free to add whatever important points you feel are missing in the comment section. I also will not be adding any links. All the evidence has been covered extensively by others and can be easily found in the various RP, MGTOW  and MRA subs, blogs and YouTube channels.

**The olden days**

Go back to before the industrial revolution and life was brutal and short. Poverty, starvation and serfdom were a way of life for most people. No one had rights, everyone had responsibility. Responsibility to your parents, your spouse, your children, your community and God. War and disease were real, ever present dangers that could strike at any moment.

In this context, the man was in charge of his family. He had to be, his wife needed him to be, his children needed him to be and his elderly parents needed him to be in charge of the household. As the strongest member of the family whose hormones don't yo-yo, it made most sense for him to be the undisputed leader. This was so out of necessity of life, not because men are tyrants nor because women are pushovers. There simply wasn't any other way to survive and raise the future generation.

**Modernization**

Massive, unprecedented changes swept over the world with the industrial revolution. The brute force of male muscle was being replaced by machines in factories. Sure, men still needed muscle to operate many of those old machines, but that was a step away from the back\-breaking labor that preceded the invention of industry. Thus, men were slightly less needed in their traditional roles. The first seeds of feminism and rights for women soon followed. (Many other changes came to the world as a result, we will only focus on what's pertinent to this very specific discussion).

As society developed, the need for the husbands protection diminished due to communities being better protected against marauding bandits and the like. The need for the husbands provision was diminished because women can also operate many of the machines which required less and less brute muscle power. The idea of equality for women became more and more of a debate in its many manifestations. This was never a viable thought before the industrial revolution because there was no way a woman could survive in the world without a man in her life.

**The birth control pill**

The one thing that drastically changed the debate and was perhaps the main contributing factor to ushering in second wave feminism and the sexual revolution of the 60""s was the birth control pill. With the pill, a woman could have sex without the risk of pregnancy! This is when marriage took the bullet of death, the institution has been bleeding out ever since.

In the past, if a woman got pregnant out of wedlock, she was royally screwed. In the distant past, she had little chance of survival in the harsh elements even if she wasn't pregnant, nursing or raising a child. Since the industrial revolution, she could work in a factory, but that wasn't possible while pregnant and nursing etc. Getting pregnant had **serious life altering consequences** and that's why women were extremely selective about whom they had sex with. For this reason, women **needed** marriage as a form of security before you were allowed to even think about sex.

All this changed with the pill. Women were now free to have consequence free sex, **and that's exactly what they did!** Women ""threw off"" the old shackles of ""sexual oppression"" and were now ""liberated"". Men went along with it because what man wants to turn down free sex? Please see - [Women are the gatekeepers of sex\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8dgnhj/back\_to\_the\_basics\_women\_are\_the\_gatekeepers\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8dgnhj/back_to_the_basics_women_are_the_gatekeepers_of/))

**The Red Pill**

As you can see, feminism evolved as a natural result of modernization. Various mini evolution processes within feminism can be traced to specific developments in modern invention that raised the standard of life and thus diminished the absolute need for a husband to a need that was less absolute and then less of a need. To discuss each specific step along the way is way too long and has been covered extensively by others. The point here is to observe **that** these changes coincide with ever shifting changes in the standard of living and the family dynamic.

All this led to greater and greater freedoms for women and unleashed female sexuality in a way the world has never seen. Never before was female sexuality unrestrained like it is today. At first, remnants of old values still existed and so it wasn't that bad for men. However, as time progressed and society continued to shift, the individual man became less and less needed to the individual woman while the collective man (via the government) became more and more the replacement husband. Women began demanding things from the government and the government husband began to fulfill those demands because women are the majority of the voters. Divorce laws, child custody laws, laws pertaining to domestic and sexual violence all began shifting in a manner that favors women and mistreats men.

Additionally, female sexuality is \[hypergamous\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8fujkz/back\_to\_the\_basics\_hypergamy/] (https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8fujkz/back_to_the_basics_hypergamy/)) This resulted in more and more men being deemed undesirable and excluded from the sexual market place. Most of these men aren't objectively undesirable, they would have made wonderful husbands in the past. They have **become** undesirable due to unrestrained hypergamy.

Furthermore, men began to notice how much the game was rigged against them. Free love is only free if you're on top of the attractiveness scale, otherwise you have to pay. Even if you do take on a wife and happily pay for her, she can leave you at any time for any reason and take away most of what you worked for through alimony and child support. She can claim domestic abuse and she'll be believed, she can claim rape and she'll be believed. As a man, your life can be over if any of these things happen to you, how much more so is your life over if all of them happen.

**A bitter, bitter pill**

Thus, The Red Pill was born. Men began forming online communities and  trading notes with each other. Some men were burned through divorce and/or false allegations. Some were burned through harsher trials and longer prison sentences for the same crimes. Some were excluded from the sexual market place. **Some weren't burned at all**, they simply watched others get burned from touching the hot stove and decided not to do the same.

The logical conclusion is to walk away from all women until the pendulum swings back to a normal, fair and sustainable place. However, this is **not easy at all!** Men have a **tremendous** sexual drive that is insanely massive and ever present. Forgoing women and sex altogether is nearly impossible for most men. So what's a man to do? How does one engage with the positive sides of women without being burned by the ever increasing negative side? This inner struggle is why taking TRP is so bitter for men. This is why most men don't take TRP, **TRP is forced down the throat of men by women** in most cases. Women instinctively know this, that's why the first question often is \- who hurt you?

The answer to this question (how to engage without being burned) is a topic of great debate in TRP communities. The first thing many men try is the MRA route. This seems the most sensible way to restore equilibrium. However, the MRA has been around for quite some time with no real results. This is because feminism is the natural outgrowth of societal changes that released biological tendencies (as explained above). Therefore, while every RP man believes in the MRA, most aren't willing to engage in a futile battle. Instead, some will enjoy the decline through learning game and pumping and dumping. Some will incorporate RP ideas within their marriages. Some will go MGTOW. There's no objectively true answer as all the options are disgustingly bitter pills to swallow.

**Conclusion**

Feminism was a natural result of hidden/squashed biological traits of female sexuality being released due to modernization. TRP is male self preservation being unleashed as a direct progression from feminism. TRP is contrary to the core of male sexual desire and is therefore an extremely bitter pill to swallow, albeit extremely necessary.

8f6upu,'For Women Only' - Insecurity &amp; Affirmation - Chapter 3,"First, check out the introduction post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cndeb/for_women_only_i_read_books_so_you_dont_have_to/) before you get started. Also, if you haven’t read the summary for [Chapter 2 on Respect](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cnh7l/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2/) you *may* want to do that as well. This post will assume you’ve read it.

*Disclaimer: this is a summary of Chapter 3 in the book [For Women Only](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-About/dp/1601424442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523799560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=for+women+only) not my own thoughts, feelings or research.*

Let’s get started.

***

The fearful question that a woman quietly asks herself is “Am I loveable”. We have a deep and innate desire to be loved and cared for.  In the last chapter we discussed our men’s correspondingly deep desire for respect. **The question for men is not then “am I lovable” it is instead “Do I measure up?”** And a man will look to those who know him best to answer that question. 


We think of our men as strong and confident with no self doubt. But in truth men have an inner vulnerability that stems from two competing drives. Men wants to tackle great challenges, try difficult things and conquer the world. Competing with this is the very real possibility of failure which is excruciating for men to consider and cope with. As we learned from Chapter 2, one of men’s greatest emotional needs is to feel competent at what they do. The problem is that men overwhelmingly feel that what they do is constantly being watched and judged. Though they have the drive to succeed they *feel* that they are one mess up from being found out as impostors.

The author’s studies found that about three quarters of men feel insecure and doubt their ability to ‘hack it’. This comes up in nearly all areas of their lives. This means work, home and play. The word she, and the men in her surveys, use to describe these feelings is “impostor”.  

The men in our lives are hiding a deep sense of self doubt. The inner uncertainty leaves even the most confident man dreading that he will be exposed for the imposter he feels himself to be. Even the most confident and in control men will often feel like like sometimes they are faking it and fear that their inadequacies will be discovered. 



Every man wants to do well and appear competent at whatever it is he sets out to do but 76% claimed that they are *“not always as confident as I look.”* A man worries that if anyone, like his boss or his loving wife, knew him for who he really is, they would realize the truth. This truth, of course, is that at least some of the time he’s not who he appears to be. He’s not the confident, self assured, competent man who he projects to the world. And the idea that someone knows he can’t cut it is humiliating.

&amp;nbsp;

### What is he thinking? 

It probably doesn’t cross your mind that your man is lacking in confidence. After all, you chose him and you have the utmost confidence in him. And when expressed properly, our confidence in him *can* translate into confidence in himself. But many men express these fears of inadequacy or being found out.

The surveys show that men think: 

* “**I’m always being judged** - Men are hard enough on themselves without any external pressure. But there *is* external pressure. And whether it is true or not, they feel that the eyes of the world are trained on them. Though it is us women who receive the blame for caving to social pressures; men also think about how others perceive them. They are being judged and so are their abilities. **Jokes about men’s inadequacies hurt most because they confirm men’s fear that they are being judged and are falling short.** 

* “**I have no earthly idea how to do this**” - Men can feel like they are impostors at what they do and often feel that they are running to stay one step ahead of others. This especially occurs when they have to do something new and unfamiliar. One man told the author that when given a new task or challenge he thinks, *“I have no idea how to do this and I hope I learn it before someone finds out”*. She originally thought that this was an attitude that affects only the young and inexperienced but through her research she heard the same sentiment from highly accomplished men as well. 

* “**But I want to do this**” In the face of self doubt, men still want to try something new and possibly fantastic. There is a fear that if they try they will be publicly outed as an ‘impostor’ but the only way for a man to move forward in the world is to try new things. **The times when men are attempting something new are the times when they will feel the shakiest and need the most encouragement**

&amp;nbsp;

### They can feel like impostors at work

There has always been uncertainty for a man regarding his adequacy at his job. This has only gotten worse for our men as companies act with less loyalty and fewer people stay in one firm for their entire careers. Men can feel incredible anxiety and uncertainty about how they are performing at work. There is usually an underlying fear of being found out and of course the subsequent consequences of being deemed an impostor by your boss. 

If you aren’t sure whether your man falls into this category, well, he probably does. But think about his behavior with work. Does he he works long hours to prove that he can provide for you? Does he come home drained because of the constant need to appear competent and on the ball? 

Professional sports and corporate America share the same “What have you done for me lately” attitude. Everyone is on the replacement list and you have to stay off the top. Insecurity seems logical when you look at it that way! This is often why men work such long hours. It is insurance in his mind that he won’t fall behind.

And the fear of failure isn’t entirely negative. It can drive him to get out of bed in the morning, to get to the gym, to accomplish his goals.  

&amp;nbsp;

### They can feel like impostors at home

A man’s performance anxiety doesn’t end at the front door. Many men reported feeling as concerned about inadequacy at home as in the office. Men want to be good husbands and fathers but they worry that they may not know how to succeed at everything required of them. And unlike the office, where success can be attached to numbers and performance reviews, the measure of success is *much* harder to pin down at home. 

**Many men judge their success as husbands based on the happiness and respect of their wives.** If a man is trying to bluff his way through being a husband, he will feel relieved when his wife feels loved and happy or publically honors how well he does at husbanding. If he gets the cold shoulder, a wife who challenges him or expresses displeasure or lack of respect it’s a sign to him that he’s an imposter and not doing well at his “good husband” goal. 

No man thinks he has all the answers. He’ll often look to his father as a role model. If he has a good father, he will mine those experiences for guidance. If, however, he had a bad father he’ll feel like he’s making it up as he goes along. 

Sometimes, if a man has the sense that he’s an impostor as a husband and father he will  withdraw from taking an active role with his wife and kids. He pulls away to protect himself if he doesn’t think he can do it well or be affirmed in what he’s doing.

Fair, probably not, but emotions aren’t fair. 

&amp;nbsp;

### What should we do for our men? 

It is often said that you cannot change a man. This is particularly the case when we are talking about the way he is wired. We can, however, impact how he feels about his ability to make his way in the world. 

Because men have these private doubts about how they measure up, our respect can be immeasurably important. Once we understand that these fears underly how he moves through the world we can see that our words and actions can make a huge impact.

The key is to soothing a man’s worries is affirmations and a bit of plain old flattery. If the person who knows him best believes in him, he is empowered to do well in every area of his life.  If he isn’t receiving affirmation from us, he’ll seek out places that he can receive affirmation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Never tear your man down. If a wife reinforces her husband’s fears of inadequacy it can become a self fulfilling prophecy**. In the survey’s the author found that *only* 1 man in 4 felt appreciated by their families. She suggests that it is unlikely that 3 out of 4 families did not appreciate their men but perhaps were not expressing their appreciation enough.

So even if we do truly appreciate our men, *and of course we do!*, are we showing it enough?

Your husband has to be convinced that his wife thinks he’s the greatest. If he doesn’t feel this way, he’ll seek out validation elsewhere. There are many place men will seek solace from an unappreciative family: 

* Maybe he’ll spend more time at work where he feels alive and on top of his game, 

* He might spend too much time watching sports for the competitive thrill 

* Some men will retreat to a workshop or office where they are in control of their environment or tasks 

* Another will seek out the intern who admires him.

* Some participate in sports where there is built in admiration and accomplishment 

None of these (well maybe the intern) are negative indulgences for your man. If he finds something that makes him feel alive and encouraged, great! However, other pursuits should not be a retreat for an unsatisfying home life.

&amp;nbsp;

**Our goal is to make him feel alive and encouraged at home first and to act as a cheerleader for his other endeavors. This means admiring him for his accomplishments, bragging about him to friends, expressing what a wonderful father and husband he is. And of course sex.**

Sex **is** affirmation!!!! It plays a huge role in a man’s self confidence. A man can be having a horrible time in every other area of his life but if his woman wants him physically he’ll feel capable of handling it all. On the other hand, if he gets the *don’t touch me* message at home then it will be more devastating than failures in the other areas and he’ll feel an impostor in every area. 

Home should be a comfortable safe zone for a man. If work is a place of judgement, then home should be a place where he can relax and open up. It should not be a place where a man feels one misstep away from being exposed. 

And this can be hard. If we don’t pay attention, it’s easy to only notice our men’s mistakes. If we find ourselves in a pattern of noticing mistakes too often (and not praising accomplishments large and small) we create a situation where our men cannot relax and open up at home. It is up to us to create the intimate and safe environment to make it possible for him to let down his guard. 

**Home should be a retreat from the pressure of having to perform.** 

&amp;nbsp;

### The gift of confidence. 


Men put a lot of pressure on themselves. One man told the author, “I want my wife to understand my weakness and shortcomings and still want me. I want her encouragement to become the man I can be.”  And ladies, I’m sure you already feel confident that he can be everything he believes he can be. The only additional step is to express those feelings!

By staunchly supporting them and their goals, by constantly showing and telling them that we believe in them, and by providing a safe environment for them to come home to, we can give our men the confidence to dive into the work fray. 

Jack Welsh explains (*emphasis mine*): 

&gt; Perhaps the greatest single gift she gave me was self confidence. It is what I looked for and tried to build in every executive who has ever worked with me. *Confidence gives you courage and extends your reach. It lets you take greater risks and achieve far more than you ever thought possible.* Building self confidence in others is a huge part of leadership. It comes from providing opportunities and challenges for people to do things they never imagined they could do; rewarding them after they reach success in every way possible.

A wife can give her husband that confidence. You must realize that in spite of the veneer of confidence our men still crave our affirmation that they’ve done good. Tell him, often, that you are proud of him and believe in him, brag about him and his accomplishments loudly to the world and show him how much you desire him as a man.

**Life is a battle and if he can return home to someone who supports him unconditionally, he can slay dragons.**

8epbgq,Back to the basics - men are the gatekeepers of commitment.,"[Back to the basics - women are the gatekeepers of sex](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8dgnhj/back_to_the_basics_women_are_the_gatekeepers_of/)

**The natural state of women** 

At her core, a woman is a someone. A person of worth who deserves to be cherished, loved, sustained and taken care of. This isn't objectively true. However, it is the way women view themselves and the way men view women. Women deserve to be treated well just for existing. Thus, women are human **beings**. 

Women value emotional reality over objective reality, feelz over realz. Your feelings are 100% valid even if you're objectively wrong. Whereas men tend to evaluate the objective reality and tell you to stop feeling the way you do because you're being ridiculous, women tend to validate your feelings first even if you're being ridiculous from an objective standpoint. The premise behind that is - I exist, therefore my feelings are just as real as the reality of the world around me. 

When mommy is happy, everyone is happy and when a woman is in distress, everyone comes to her aid. Both men and women reinforce her sense of existence. 

**Female bonding desire** 

If a woman is a full on something, what more can she need? The answer is - some of the male's nothingness. A core need of women is to pair and bond with a man. 

Men begin from a position of nothingness and need to achieve to become a something, women begin from a position of being a something and need a man to imbue them with a sense of nothingness. Female sexual desire includes being dominated by a strong male (hello fifty shades of gray, a best seller book!). Female relationship needs include men who are decisive and who can lead. Women date up, marry up and have sex up. One way to look at the common thread in all of this is - women need to feel smaller in the presence of their man. They need to feel more nothingness. 

This feeling of nothingness before her man does not contradict the feeling that's at the core of her being - that of being a something. She will always see herself as an inherently valid something who wants to lose herself in the strong arms of the best man available. Thus, she wants a man who will cause her knees to turn to jelly, not a man who will actually turn her into an actual nothing through abuse and the like. Therefore, women are extremely picky with regards to men. Only the best men are up for consideration. 


**Gatekeepers of commitment**

It's therefore no wonder why men hold all the cards when it comes to commitment. If a man's worst fear is being a nobody, a woman's worst fear is being all alone. OTOH, unlike men whose default is to be sexually attracted to all women with the exception of those who turn him off, a women's default is to reject all men except for the ones who make the cut. This means that most men aren't even in the running, but if you're from the few who are, you decide on the degree of commitment. 

This is as true once the relationship is well underway as it is true during that first day of commitment. While the man may feel like he committed to her forever, she certainly doesn't feel that way (just like he doesn't feel sexually desired forever). His commitment to her is something for which she needs constant reassurance. A woman will be plagued with self doubt that boils down to - am I still lovable today? And therefore - **will he still commit to me today?** When a man expresses his love and desire or makes her feel special, he signals his commitment to her. Just as he needs constant reaffirmation of his sexual desirability, so too does she need constant reaffirmation of her worthiness for commitment. 

The problem is when expressing his love for her and commitment to her decrease her sexual attraction to him. This is like a self destructive autoimmune disease and will be discussed in a future post. 

**Conclusion** 

The natural state of the woman is to be a deserving someone, her fear is to be alone. What she craves is for some male nothingness to be instilled in her heart by the strong arms of a powerful man. She feels secure when her knees turn to jelly in his presence. She needs constant reassurance of his commitment.  

Unfortunately, most men don't measure up. This part of female nature is cruel to men. Those who do measure up hold the keys to commitment. 

Cheers!

8cynb3,“Men are intimidates by intelligence in women”,"(*Intimidated, sorry I’m on mobile.)

Ever hear that phrase?  It’s very common in the mainstream view these days. 

We’ve debunked it here before, but thought it could do with more discussion. 

I don’t believe this statement to be true, that men are intimidated by smart women. 

I do believe that men in general are not turned on by contrarian, argumentative, prideful women.  Which is all too common these days among women who proclaim themselves smart.   

I know I always had good grades, but I had to unlearn this “points for speaking up, even if you have nothing good to say” lesson.   I was always critiqued in school for only talking in class when I had something to say. 

The idea of intelligence these days is often linked with cutthroat competition, corporate climbing, debating and shutting down the opposition, mic drop, etc.  

Being that competitive isn’t conducive to love or friendships. 

Intelligence as valued by mainstream culture also is divorced from life wisdom, street smarts so to speak. 

I’m certain men are very much interested in women who are practical and can handle life well, making wise choices that make things easier for the family.  

So far cry from sitting in an ivory tower insulting people’s intellect.  Imagine having a PhD but no idea how to be frugal, negotiate, or judge character.   

As you can see, the modern idea of intelligence is divorced from femininity.   

Think of a stereotype like a sexy nurse, librarian, or secretary.   Men are clearly aroused by these roles that all require being very smart.  But what they share in common is feminine demeanor.  Nurses nurture, librarians assist, secretaries are helping a superior, traditionally male in the stereotype. 

So I think men are not in fact turned off by smarts.   They are turned off by aggressive competitive arguing, or intellectual pride showing off but detached from being a woman.   Would you want to be friends with anyone like that?  You might read their blog, but hang out with them?  In fact several studies say that men admire that intellectual quality from a distance, but not up close and personal. 

Men also don’t require intelligence as a top priority the way women require in men. 

So, being smart is no excuse for trouble with men. 

The good news also is that if you have areas where you aren’t as smart, (I know I do,) it’s not a dealbreaker for most guys.   And if you’re smart, you don’t have to hide it, just don’t make that your main personality trait; be agreeable, and don’t assume your intellect is going to impress him the way respect and femininity would.  


Edits for typos.  

Edit: I fully support competition in fun things like arcades or board game dates.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cynb3/men_are_intimidates_by_intelligence_in_women/,1523988422.0,105,0.92,77,RedPillWomen,Rivkariver
8cnh7l,'For Women Only' - Respect and Love - Chapter 2,"First, check out the introduction post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cndeb/for_women_only_i_read_books_so_you_dont_have_to/) before you get started. 

*Disclaimer: this is a summary of Chapter 2 in the book [For Women Only](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-About/dp/1601424442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523799560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=for+women+only) not my own thoughts, feelings or research.*

Let’s get started.

***
If you take away one thing from this post, let it be this:  **To Men, respect means more than love. In fact, when given the choice, men would rather feel unloved than inadequate and disrespected**. 

The Author begins by describing a relationship retreat that she attended as a young adult. To demonstrate men and women’s relationship needs, they did a quick “experiment”. After putting all the men on one side of the room and all the women on the other the following question was asked: “If you **had** to choose, would you rather feel **alone and unloved** or **inadequate and disrespected**?” 

If you’ve spent some time on RPW you can probably see where this is going. 

The majority of women said they would never want to feel alone and unloved (to the surprise of the men). **The men, on the other than, overwhelmingly preferred to be alone and unloved as long as they did not feel inadequate or disrespected**. The women in the group were just as surprised by this information and rightly so. Without being told otherwise, we all innately expect the opposite sex to share our perceptions of the relationship. 


Respect for men is so critical that 3 out of 4 would prefer to go their entire lives feeling unloved than disrespected.

**The Author’s lightbulb moment comes when she realizes that a man equates the respect and love. With this in mind, we can see that for a man feeling disrespected is no different than feeling unloved.**

&amp;nbsp;
 
If we want to love our guys in a way that *matters to them*  we need to respect them. 

&amp;nbsp;

In just the way that we want to be loved unconditionally, even when we are miserable, sick, pmsing, cranky, you name it; men need respect to be unconditional. This might mean respecting him and trusting him even if you don’t feel like he’s meeting your expectations. It is very common for us (as a culture) to believe that love is supposed to be unconditional but respect is something you must earn. For your man, love **is** respect. If you love him unconditionally, then you must respect him just as unconditionally or he won’t feel it. 

Remember, we give what we receive. **A man who is unconditionally respected by his SO will in turn, show her unconditional love**.

&amp;nbsp;

### Disrespect and your Man

Women cry when they feel unloved and alone. This is our natural reaction. How many fights have you had with a man where you felt terrible and cried? Now, how many fights have you had with a man where he gets angry and blows up? 

Men express the pain of disrespect through anger. In the heat of the moment, none of us are good at articulating our feelings. A man is unlikely to say “you disrespected me and I do not appreciate that”. Instead, he feels the pain and humiliation of your disrespect and it expresses itself as anger. 

*Think about that the next time he gets angry. That anger is the same thing as your tears. It is a likely a response to something you did or said that made him feel disrespected (and remember, respect is male for love).*

&amp;nbsp;

### How are we messing up? 

No matter how many times we say: “I love you” as long as we continuing trying to control things men **will** interpret it as disrespect and mistrust. 

If we keep the mentality that ‘respect is earned’ then we are putting the onus on him to be amazing. Remember, we chose our men because we vet well and start out thinking they are amazing. Hold on to the respect that you felt early in your relationship. Do this because **choosing to trust, appreciate, admire and believe in him is choosing respect and respect is a choice we make.** 

But if you don’t respect him? 

It’s possible that you are you caught in *The Crazy Cycle*. This happens when the man doesn’t give enough love, so the woman doesn’t feel love and treats him with distrust and as undeserving of respect, he in turn feels slighted and then doesn’t give love. If you choose respect and *behave as though your respect him* him it breaks the cycle. 

But how can I respect him if I don’t feel respect?  

We do this by understanding that feelings follow words and actions rather than the other way around. If you disaparage him all the time, then you will begin to feel contemptuous of him. This is simply the way our brains are wired.  The decision to show respect can easily turn to actual feeling of respect. And you must demonstrate it. It’s not real to a man unless you show it. 

&amp;nbsp;

###In practice

&amp;nbsp;

Saying to him: “I respect you” doesn’t have the same impact as him saying to you “I love you”. Instead, te needs to hear things like:  “honey I’m so proud of you”, “I trust you”, and “thank you for what you did”. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are six areas where men need to be shown respect. 

**Respect his judgement** This means respecting his knowledge, opinions, and decisions. You show this by not questioning his knowledge or argueing with his decisions. Defer to him. Many men expressed that their coworkers trust their judgement more than their wives do. Men wish they could tell their wives to show more trust in their decision making abilities

&amp;nbsp;

**Respect his abilities** Men need to figure things out for themselves. They have a drive to conquer the world in big and small ways. This might be as simple as conquering the handyman fixes around the house. If a man sets a task for himself and we try to help, he will most likely  interpret it as a sign of our distrust in him. You must have confidence that he can learn and do these things. 

The age old example of asking for directions explains this problem. Telling him to ask for directions is interpreted as telling him you don't trust him to figure it out himself. Maybe you don’t but let him figure it out. 
**Forcing ourselves to trust him in little things is a big deal to a man. The little demonstrations of respect are signs of our overall trust in him**. 

And when it comes to giving advice, we must remember that he is the one up to bat and it is his competency on the line. Giving advice can get *very* close to telling him how to do it and *that* sends the message that we don’t believe in him or his abilities. When you want to give advice, try instead to tell him simply: “I know you can do it!”

&amp;nbsp;

**Respect what he accomplishes** It is important for a man that he does something, does it well, and **someone notices**. In a survey conducted by the author, she realized that while girls ask themselves “Am I special, am I loveable?” boys ask themselves “Do I measure up? Am I any good at what I do?” 

**Men needed to feel noticed, able, and appreciated for what they do externally.** This means saying things like:  “You did well at that meeting” or  “you are such a great dad” Both of these sentiments can be better than “I love you”. 

An important side note here is the issue of “Thank you ...but”. This is painful for a man to hear. You may not intend it this way but to him it sounds like ‘you failed’ If your man has expressed that “nothing I do is ever good enough for you” Then you’ve been sending the message “you tried and failed”). 

**Always tell him you are proud of him.**
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Respect in communication** As women we have the power to build our men up or tear them down. Some things we do will push buttons or be very painful even if that isn’t our intent. What we say matters but so does how and where we say things. 

You may say: “I want to fix this thing in the house, but you aren’t a fix it guy, we should hire someone” He will hear: “You can’t do it, you are inadequate”. 

Sometimes men will hear disappointment in the things we say. They will read negativity into reminders about chores and tasks, or worse they will hear accusations of laziness and mistrust. Inherent in the reminder is a statement of disappointment, it’s the implication that they failed. 
Other times they will hearing attacks. The author crafted a  survey question:  “Do you know how to put together a romantic event that your SO would enjoy” This comes across as attack mode because it starts off by suggesting the man is inept. Instead she rephrases the question as “Suppose you had to plan an anniversary event for your partner, do you know how”. This is better because it doesn’t question his adequacy and abilities.


**Remember, It doesn’t matter what we’re saying, it matters what he hears. Most men are highly sensitive to disrespect including seeing it where we never intend We need to adjust to their sensitivities just as we’d expect them to adjust to ours. It is important to love your partner in the way they need to be loved.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Respect in public**  Never criticize, put down or question your man’s judgement in front of others. Often what we women consider light teasing is actually torment to men. Women sometimes feel that they need to take their man’s ego down a notch. This couldn’t be further from the truth. We do not have to take down their egos because their egos are incredibly fragile. What is at stake in these situations is not his overabundance of pride but rather his secret feelings of inadequacy. Public disrespect is painful and men will avoid it at any cost. **Some single men told the author that public disrespect is a sufficient red flag to cause a break up**. No man wants to live with public disrespect, teasing or criticism for the rest of his life. What we think of as good natured teasing isn't good natured from his perspective. 

The author relays a discussion with her father. Here is what he told her: : “a man might take wrong any sort of teasing that shows that he is not in control or doesn’t have the respect of his wife. Men wouldn’t take this from another man at all, so it is not appropriate for his wife to tease him in this way either. The man is the provider and protector and a woman’s teasing tells others that she believes that her husband doesn’t know how to take care of everything.” He also tells her that “It depends on if a guy is already feeling inadequate in a particular area.” What one man mind brush off, another will find painful *if he’s already questioning himself in that arena*. “It is far worse to be teased in front of other men. Guys are in competition and your wife knows you better than anyone. If your wife, who knows you best, doesn’t respect you then why should other men. It’s a sign of weakness if you don’t know the other man well. It’s also humiliating because the other man will feel sorry for you that your wife doesn’t respect you”. They point out that belittling your husband in front of other men can even derail his career because other men will see him as weak and not worthy of respect. 

In addition to how this negative talk makes them men feel when they are present, it causes problems for us even when our men are not in the room. Talking negatively behind you man’s r back is both public (even though he’s not there) and impacts our own feelings. Because, once again, feelings follow speech and action,  if you talk poorly about your man, you can start to feel dissatisfied with the relationship. 

**If you publicly build your man up, he’ll think you are amazing. Do this with honest praise and soliciting help in front of others.** Tell stories that show him in a good light. From what the men say, this is equivalent to a dozen roses and a surprise night out without kids. He will feel adored.

&amp;nbsp;

**Respect in our assumptions** Take some time and listen to your own assumptions. You may not realize how often your assumptions come from a place of negativity or distrust.: Some examples: a. We assume that ge needs to be reminded (Honey, have you done X yet?). When we do this we are assuming he’s forgetful or he *needs* to be prodded(nagging anyone?). Instead assume the best of him: “*I asked him to do it and he hasn’t done it, but I trust him so there must be a reason he hasn’t done it.* Just because  his reason is different from yours doesn’t make it less legitimate, his priorities may be different and that’s ok. b.  We assume that he’s *choosing* not to help. Instead start with the assumption that he doesn't’ see that help is needed, rather than that he sees and ignores it. Give your SO the benefit of the doubt, he likely has good intentions. c. We assign unloving motives to him. This is a problem because we know now that our words and action impact his well being and feelings of love towards us. Consider first that perhaps, it is something you did or said that pushed him into the issue. A woman who is always nagging may push her husband to withdraw and become unloving (which is really reaction to disrespect). 

&amp;nbsp;
***
We hold power and responsibility and opportunity to build up or tear down our men. We can strengthen or hobble them. Respect at home affects every area of his life. If he feels competent at home he’ll be powerful in the world. 

You can always **choose** to be respectful. Don’t ignore problems, but find things to appreciate and applaud regardless. Focus on what is good and worthy of praise. 

Men are forgiving once wives and girlfriends suddenly ‘get it’. Apologize if you’ve been disrespectful. And most importantly, when you apologize: don’t say  *I’m sorry I made you feel this way*. Instead say:  *I’m really sorry I said that, it was disrespectful and I know I can trust you.*

**Remember, behind every man is a good woman - if a man’s wife supports and believes in him, he can conquer the world.**

8cndeb,'For Women Only' - I read books so you don't have to - Intro,"We’ve been circling around discussions of “Alpha” and “Beta” men recently and I think it’s time to get back to understanding the similarities among all men. Your mix of alpha/beta may be completely different from my mix of alpha/beta but there are certain aspects of masculinity and male thinking that are going to be close to universal, AMALT if you will. 

These foundations of masculine thinking are of the utmost importance for women to understand if we hope to create happy fulfilling relationships for both ourselves and our partners. 

[For Women Only](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-About/dp/B00DGYRKGE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523544395&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=for+women+only) had a huge impact on the way that I understood my Husband and helped me to start making tweaks to my behavior that lead us to a happier more harmonious relationship. 

The author surveyed (American) men from all walks of life and reported her findings in this book. She takes a (mostly) amoral approach to the way that men think and feel. She dives into their inner lives through anecdotes and the results of her questionnaires, finding some key commonalities that most men share. 

Some of the book leans on a Christian worldview. I will be glossing over the parts that I do not believe are applicable across the board, but I will touch on them if it makes sense. The information is solid regardless of your background. I’m not a churchgoer myself, so I’m asking for a bit of trust on this. 

There is *also* “For Men Only” that deals with the inner workings of women. One idea (not mine) is to read both books together with your partner and discuss the differences in how men and women approach the world. The author mentions that many churches have begun to use this for their pre-marriage classes. 

I **highly** recommend that everyone picks up this book. The Audible version is read by the author and is about a 4 hour listen while you are going about your day. You won’t regret the time. 

That said, I know my personal backlog of reading is enormous. So for everyone who doesn’t have the time, energy or Audible account to go through this herself, I’ll be writing summaries of each chapter. For the sake of brevity (something I’m not good at as you may have noticed) I’m going to stick to the authors words, advice and opinions in each post. The posts will be long enough doing just that. If you have questions or need something expanded upon, I’ll happily get into that in the comments with you. 

Finally, of note, the author uses surveys and interviews. In no case does she say that ALL men feel a particular way. Her research shows that *most* men behave or think as described. [Let’s generalize about men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu3FE7BswYI) rather than discuss why “my guy isn’t like that” or “I’m a girl and I do that too”.

Enjoy!!

8chfer,Back to the basic - value,"Today I'll be starting a series of posts called back to the basics. Each post will focus on a concept of RP theory. If it goes well, more posts will be added more frequently. Today's post will be about value. 

**What is value?** 

The basic meaning of value is when someone or something is meaningful in some way. Everything that exists has value to someone, not everything has value to you. 

The biblical idea that ""man is created in the image of God"" means that every human being has intrinsic value and we therefore may not murder them (or cause unnecessary harm to them). Not all societies placed intrinsic value on every human life but that's a separate discussion. 

Even if you agree that every human life has intrinsic value in the eyes of God, it's still true that not every person is valuable to you. Even among those who are valuable to you, you value some more than others. 

**Sexual and relationship value** 

In the search for a suitable mate, one must ask themselves - does this person bring value to my life? How much value? What kind of value? What value do I add to their life? The answer will depend on what you're looking for. 

Generally speaking, men and women value different things. Thus, men need sex, love, intimacy and a soft supportive landing from women. Women need sustenance, stability, commitment, leadership and bug squashing from men. (Partial lists here). Men and women each offer to the other, what the other needs. Thus, we complete each other. That's how it works when things are balanced and therefore working well. 

There are some things that have value sexually but have no value or are detrimental to a relationship and vice versa. Therefore, when looking to start a LTR, attention must be given to balance your own conflicting needs with each other to find a happy medium. 

**Some examples of sexual value**

Men are generally attracted to young, slim (but not stick thin) women who have curves (but aren't fat), who smell nice and are pleasant to be around. Who are receptive, open to their advances and less complicated. Of course there are exceptions, but this is generally the case. 

Women are generally attracted to men who are better than themselves. Taller, stronger, smarter and wealthier are just some examples. Men who are fun, spontaneous and witty. Dangerous but protective of her. Women tend to be more picky and particular about what they sexually desire in a man. 

Having more qualities that are valuable to the opposite sex, makes you a higher value potential sexual partner. You'll therefore be considered sexy by a greater number of members of the opposite sex. 

**Examples of relationship value** 

Men generally want a woman who's respectful and yielding, supportive and uplifting, and pleasant to be around. A woman who can create a soft landing spot for him, a cozy home to dwell in. A woman who can cook and keep house and not need his guidance on every detail. A woman who's frugal and appreciates what he does for her. A woman who will be a good mother if children are desired. A woman who's honest, kindhearted and pleasant to be around. 

Women generally want a man who has stability of income, who can support them financially and emotionally, who will accept their emotional turbulence and who will be their rock. A man who will take on challenges that face the family whether big or small. A man who will lead and who is decisive. A man who will give her children and help her raise them (if children are wanted). 

**Conflicting values**

This is really worthy of its own post and perhaps another post will be written on the matter. But in short - some values conflict with others. For example the female sexual desire for a fun, spontaneous and witty man might be in direct conflict with her relationship desire for a stable, steady and responsible man. Finding the perfect balance in the same man is almost impossible and a highly unrealistic goal to set. These conflicting desires need reconciliation and a degree of compromise is absolutely necessary to have a sustainable marriage. 

**Conclusion**

Everything has some sort of value, but only some things have value to you. The question is - what's valuable to you and how will you compromise to reconcile between conflicting internal values.

8bnlbm,The problem with being a housewife -spoiler: it's other people (rant),"I got married last August, we decided (I've been thinking about it for a long time) that I would stay at home with the kids. I've gotten some  strange feminist-ish push back. I thought they were all about ""choice"", but when I mentioned that it was my job to do the laundry and take care if the house, etc. to his sister he became the bad guy, within a conversation where I and her husband were siding together over things we have in common vs. our spouses (a brother and sister who have a lot in common, including their choice in their mates personalities). I don't mean that to sound adversarial, it was an overall pleasant conversation up until the moment that she completely switched sides. I am in full on housewife mode now and I feel some look down on that choice, I don't understand and feel like it is so much better than working $10/hr. restaurant jobs for the rest of my life. This is my job now and I wish people would lay off about it, and automatically assume he pushed me into doing everything at home while he gets to go off and work. Saying ""gets to"" like there's some sort of fun involved, is an awfully strange way of pointing out that he works hard at a back breaking job to provide support for our family. Yes, I work hard at home too, but he deserves to be doted on for his contribution, and I'm happy to do it. 


Sorry for the rant, just found this sub and glad there's more people like me to have these sorts of (hopefully) rational conversations about this type of stuff.

8aqzf5,The default male setting is beta.,"Strong men are made, not born. 

An alpha male is a strong masculine man. Strong either physically, emotionally, mentally, intellectually and/or in any other way. Independence, achievement and adventurous fun are part of what make men masculine. Masculine traits in men give women tingles. 

A beta male is a male who has more feminine traits. Traits such as caring, nurturing, consistency and steadiness are some of the traits that are beta in nature. They're the more feminine elements of being male, although they aren't quite the same as the feminine of females. It's sort of like feminine within masculine. 

Beta traits are important to women because to build a family and raise children you need the steadiness, nurturing and soft side to emerge. Dangerous fun might be titillating and arousing, but it's destructive to raising a family. 

This creates a big problem. You need the steady commitment and nurturing of the beta in order to have a stable, long lasting marriage. However, women naturally find such men boring and that means diminishing desire for sex. This can lead to frustration and resentment from the husband and boredom and unhappiness from the wife. Both can lead to adultery, a miserable marriage and/or divorce. 

OTOH, choosing an alpha male isn't simple either. Alpha men have a lot of options and aren't necessarily inclined to settle down with any one woman. They're able to have many flings along with all their other adventures. 

**The default setting**

Anyone who is a parent to boys and girls will probably know that they are very different even from a very young age. Boys are much more rambunctious, wild and destructive as toddlers. When they grow older, they may not like girls because girl germs. They keep developing their masculine self if they're allowed to and aren't shamed or discouraged by their parents and teachers. 

All this changes the minute they hit puberty. All the macho independence flies out the window and the boys become the biggest simps, melting into soft butter in the presence of an eligible female! This is because it's hardwired into men to desire women with this insane level of desire, to be soft and kind to women, to be giving and caring to women and to bend over backwards to fulfill her every wish and desire. These traits make him a beta male and are not good for the female sex drive. This is the default setting. 

Men can learn to be more masculine, but this does not come naturally. There's no such thing as a natural alpha. You may think he's a natural because you met him once he's been in this world for 2-3 decades or more, once he's been through many rejections in life, once he's had time to hone his masculine side. All this comes with hard work, none of it is natural. Naturally, he's programmed to be smitten with immense sexual desire for the female and to do whatever she wants in the hopes of the actualization of this desire. 

**Who ought to change?** 

This question really deserves it's own post, but the short answer is - both of you need to change. He needs to go against his nature of bending over backwards to pleas you to start standing up to you and to stop being a pushover to your every whim. You need to go against your nature of making demands on him to fulfill said whims, of criticizing him when he doesn't get it right or of nagging him when he doesn't move fast enough to do what you think he needs to do. 

He needs to go against his nature of repressing all emotions and to be a little vulnerable and establish emotional intimacy with you. You in turn need to find sexual appeal in the things he does for you by viewing them as acts of strength. You need to be appreciative of his steady support, caring and nurturing and never take it for granted. 

**Conclusion** 

Marriage requires a fine balance of many opposing traits. Harmony is when such balance is achieved. Both men and women need to recalibrate towards the middle in order to achieve such balance. This is something our great grandparents knew, but this wisdom has been somewhat forgotten in an age where we all expect the other person to make all the accommodations. 

So if you're ever thinking to yourself - my husband is so beta (or any other trait that you find undesirable), can I get him to change? You need to do two things right away. 1. Look in the mirror and see what **you** can change. 2. Learn to view his trait from a different angle, an angle that might make the same trait look appealing and attractive.

88ggc1,Femininity isn't superficial,"How many times have you heard some variation of these things? *Feminine women don't drink! Feminine women don't swear! Feminine women only wear dresses and skirts!*

These things are all well and good, but these things are not, in themselves, feminine. Taking this kind of advice -- eliminating drinking, refusing to swear, and only wearing dresses -- and expecting to become truly feminine is the equivalent of putting on a white coat and expecting to become a doctor. Sure, most doctors wear white coats; but while that is a *marker* of their status, it isn't what makes them a doctor. And neither do these superficial things make a woman feminine. Perhaps even more importantly, just as a doctor is still a doctor without a white coat, a feminine woman is still a feminine woman in pants with a glass in her hand. 

Then what is femininity? 

Femininity is a mode of being. It is more action than presentation. Does that mean you should ignore advice to not drink, not swear, and to wear dresses? That's up to you. The wonderful thing about femininity is that it doesn't require faithful observance to specific personality traits. Maybe you're a beer connoisseur, maybe you think dresses aren't practical, maybe you don't want to censor yourself when it isn't necessary. You don't have to, in order to be feminine, as long as you are able to fulfill the most important parts -- the things that are not superficial. Be positive, empathetic, kind, supportive, submissive, open, and loving.

84gaz2,Advice please: BF [31] has high SMV that will only get higher. What can I [30F] do to grow with him?,"Some background: my boyfriend and I just bought a house, picked out rings, the whole nine yards. I love him to bits and I want to be the best possible partner I can for him.

He has recently (in the last two and a half years) lost weight, started working out, fixed his skin issues and got a very good job. He is handsome, hardworking, intelligent and incredibly kind (if a little socially awkward). He has had relatively little experience with women and most of it was pretty lame, from what he has told me.

I am not exactly a swamp hag, but I know he's just going to keep getting ""hotter"" and I'm never going to be 25 again, sadly. There are already a number of attractive young women circling him and he's starting to (slowly) realize that people might find him attractive, although he still kind of doubts this. I am not insecure, but I am also not blind; there aren't a lot of great guys like him around. 

My question is: he's just going to keep getting ""better"", so what can I do to keep him/keep up with him? I don't mean manipulating him or doing anything gross/abusive, but what kinds of things can I do to keep demonstrating my value and stay ""competitive""? I already make it a rule to get involved enthusiastically in the bedroom, make food he likes, NOT NAG, work out, etc... anyone else here have a spouse/partner with a very high SMV? How do you handle it?

83rg32,The Art of Getting Things... Without Demanding Them,"When I saw [this picture](https://i.redd.it/n2v2ulbixeg01.jpg) of men lining up to get their girlfriends flowers on Valentine's Day, it made me sad. This is what obligation looks like. 

How many of these men are getting flowers because it's Valentine's Day, and that's the thing you do on Valentine's Day?  How many of these men are getting flowers to avoid a fight, or to avoid making her cry? How many of these men are getting flowers so that they can get laid? If they're doing it for any of these reasons, then this is an obligation to them and they have no desire to do it. 

Now how many of these men and are looking forward to seeing her face light up with glee when he surprises her with flowers? I'd be willing to bet that number is ""0"". When a man is not doing it for this reason, he is a beaten down man with the life drained out of him. But when he is doing it for this reason he is excited and full of life.

Should you care *why* your man gets you flowers, as long as he gets them for you? Here are some reasons why:

1. If your man is not happy, then your relationship is not good. Go back to RPW school until you learn this.

2. If your man is happy he is more likely to get you gifts that you don't expect. He might get you flowers on Valentine's Day, or he might get you a ""I was just thinking about"" gift on a random Tuesday.

3. If a man gets you flowers, and you know he didn't have to, it makes the gift *so* much better. If he did it because you told him to, it makes it more fuzzy... did he get them because you told him to, or did he really want to?

The trick to getting men to do nice things for you, without demanding them, is to make him *want* to do nice things for you. Here are the steps for showing and developing an ""attitude of gratitude"". 

1. Be a person that he has emotional investment in. This is your basic relationship building tactics, so go back to RPW school if you don't know how to do this.

2. *Never* expect anything. I don't care if it's your birthday, Valentine's Day, Christmas or Leif Erikson day, don't expect that he gives you anything, and don't be or mad/sad if you didn't get a present. Also, never tie sex to presents, he should be getting sex either way, on a very regular basis.

3. Remember *anything* he gives you is a gift that he didn't have to give to you, and act accordingly. If he's not giving you tangible gifts, think about the intangible ones he's giving you. Spending time with you, fixing the leaky faucet, paying the mortgage, whatever. Any gift he gives you should be met with childlike delight, like you're opening your presents on Christmas morning. Smile with glee, jump up and down, kiss him, and thank him. 

4. Let him know if there's something you want, but don't make any sort of obligation or demand out of it. You're just giving him information, he will use it if he is so inclined.

If you're already in an obligation-based relationship, it's not too late to change it. Drop the obligatory behavior, and even directly apologize for it, and start to develop an ""attitude of gratitude"". In general, to feel entirely grateful for something, you must truly believe that it was an non-obligatory gift. If you don't have this internal gratitude belief system at first, that's okay, you can act like it. Slowly your beliefs will start to follow your behavior.

*Examples*

*Anecdote 1*

My SO and his best bud were planning a trip to Yosemite, and they had planned it without me. Upon finding out their plans, I let him know that I would like to come too. I was told this was just for the boys, and I let it go. After he came back from his trip, my SO admitted to me that he didn't take me along because he didn't want to feel like he ""had to"" just because I happened to be the girl that he was dating. But, when he got there he realized he missed me, and he wanted me there. So that day we began making plans to go back, just so that he could have the experience with my company. I wrote a [field report](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/29hx63/fr_i_want_to_go/?st=jenkemce&amp;sh=bb7c8aa7) about the event.

*Anecdote 2*

I don't get a present from my SO every Christmas. He has gotten things for me some years, but not every year. I always am appreciative and excited when I get something, and always have fun seeing him open the presents I got him. This year was different. This year there was *so* many presents under the tree with my name on it. Then there was... the big present, which he carefully wrapped cunningly so that I wouldn't have a notion of what it was. When I opened this present I was truly stunned and in awe. We like to go shooting together, and I have been trying (and failing) to get expert level scores for many months. My present was a rifle, that was custom designed for me and put together all by him. He bought all the pieces on the internet, and put it together while I was sleeping. He made sure that every part was picked for me. Light weight (because I'm small), small barrel (for my tiny hands), a compensator that would reduce recoil, my favorite trigger, he even drove for hours to get it all done in purple, and then bought me a matching rifle case. He told me later that he did all this because I treat him so well, and never expect anything from him.

7za0r6,"The Talk is Socially Retarded, Don't Do It.","Imagine yourself on a date with a man. It's going fairly well so far... he's confident, handsome, smart, and he has a sort of dry humor that makes you laugh. Then, about halfway through, he drops the banter, gives you a serious look, and says:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*""We need to talk. You're a nice girl, and I like you, but my goal for tonight is to have sex. So we need to talk about whether you're ready for sex, and about what kind of sexual acts you're ready for. Because I deserve sex, and if you're not a sex-minded kind of girl, then I need to not be wasting my time here.""*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About now, most of you probably feel like you need to go and take a shower just from reading that. 

That's okay, I feel like that from writing it. 

Certainly in this scenario, sex would *not* be happening, that night or any other. 

Why? Well, because it's creepy, but let's be more specific: 

* He attempted to negotiate desire, which is involuntary and cannot be negotiated. 
* He showed poor, indeed borderline autistic, social skills by not knowing this.
* He acted entitled and demanded what it was his job to inspire. 
* He treated you as a means to his own goals, rather than a person. 

**The ""Commitment Talk"" is the female version of this social blunder, and men react to it with just as much distaste, for the same reasons.**

* Negotiating Desire

Remember that commitment is not a man promising to stay, calling you his SO in public, letting you move into his house, or even marrying you. All of these are expressions of commitment. Commitment itself is his desire to keep you in his life. This is not a conscious act. **A man can neither deliberately give you commitment, nor deliberately withhold it.** You simply inspire it, or fail to. 

* Poor Social Skills

These are even more repellent in a woman than in a man, since gracefully dealing with thorny social issues where conflict may arise is a feminine art. A man wants to be with a woman who smooths over potential arguments, rather than creating them. 

* Entitled

Since you either inspire commitment or fail to, getting to commitment is your job, not his. If you attempt to dump this responsibility on him, he is certainly going to wonder what else you will just demand that you should have earned. 

* Treating him as a means to an end. 

This hardly requires explanation. He already knows what you want. If you simply demand it from him because you want it, then he will know you think that he was put on this planet to [fulfill your desires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tRdBsnX4N4).

**The art of girl game is the art of getting what you want without conflict or ultimatums, by making him want to give it to you.** Do not attempt to shortcut this process.

7x9r58,Try to lose the weight no matter what he says,"TRP say that women often say something and mean something else. However, men seem to do this too. Or, at least, my husband does.

We have been together 10 years. I have always been a little bit on the curvier side. Never too overweight. But definitely curvier. He has always said that he loves curvy women, he loves my curves etc. He likes grabbing my thighs and things like that. Whenever he sees someone who is super skinny he always says ""I don't know what men see in that kind of body type"".

Needless to say, I work out to stay toned but never bothered to lose the extra weight.

Recently, however, I've been really appreciating the RPW community and have been trying to improve myself in every single way. I'm improving how I eat and am working out more often. This has naturally resulted in my losing quite a bit of weight in the past year (10kg). 

And since then he has been obsessed with my body. I don't think I've ever seen him this turned on about my body before. He keeps saying all the other men are going to be jealous of him because his wife is so hot and he keeps talking about how toned everything is and his libido has gone through the roof. I am so happy about this!!

It could just be the fact that its a change. And men like change and diversity. It could also be that I'm more confident and he is picking up on that. Not entirely sure.

But, I don't know... It seems to me like losing weight and working on your body is always a good idea. I just thought I would put this out there if any of you also have a man who says the things mine used to say.

7tavxy,Why hobbies are so important,"RPW, I just realized something over the weekend. Perhaps it's me being slow, but this concept really hit me right on the head lately.

The reason why hobbies are so important is not only does it make you interesting long-term, but it means that **you are able to put your energy into developing a skill/passion instead of constantly seeking male attention.**

Too many women essentially use male validation as a hobby - the consequence is that even if she does secure marriage, she still is a risk at infidelity because she seeks her fun and interests in men *instead of herself and her own life*.

Even if you are technically loyal to him, he wants to see that **you are able to be happy regardless of any male attention/validation.** THIS is true security in oneself.

This is why it's so important to have your own girlfriends, to have your own hobbies, to have good relationships with your family/siblings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/7tavxy/why_hobbies_are_so_important/,1517032606.0,132,1.0,11,RedPillWomen,vanBeethovenLudwig

7pmphj,"Telling my boyfriend he's ""the captain""","Yesterday was a rough day for my boyfriend. He got home late from work after a meeting that put him in a bad mood, and he quite clearly wanted nothing to do with me or the rest of the world for a while. So I let him be for a few hours, made dinner (it was amazing, by the way -- braised chicken with mustard cream sauce, yum ;) ), and let him decide when any interaction would take place. He came into the kitchen as I was washing some dishes, and the first thing he did was apologise for having been so cold when he got home. I firmly believe that if I had not just let him be, and had instead bothered him to pay attention to me, to help with something or other, he would have never given such a tender and sincere apology.

Anyway -- a bit later, after dinner, we decided to just lay in bed and talk for a while. And it was at that time that I decided to do something I had been thinking of for a while, but that, truthfully, I was a little nervous to actually say out loud. 

""You know, I kind of get the feeling that you're the one in charge, between the two of us.""

I think that at first he took it as a reproach, because he started trying to explain it away, but I stopped him and said that no, actually, I really appreciated it. That I trust him completely and that I love being able to follow and submit to him when circumstance allows. He laughed a bit and said that I must not be a feminist -- but actually, I am. And *this* is my choice, *not* my obligation. 

It was really wonderful to see him cheer up considerably, and (very!) reassuring that he told me he wouldn't take advantage of my devotion. 

It was a heartwarming moment and felt like a small victory, but not one that I could really share with people outside this sub, so here I am giving a giddy ""morning after"" field report.

7j5g00,"For Single Ladies “Late to the Red Pill” Part II: Nun Mode, Realism vs. Settling, Vetting Mistakes","This post a follow-up to [For Single Ladies “Late to the Red Pill” Part I.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/7gqsmu/for_single_ladies_late_to_the_red_pill_part_i/0) As previously stated, it is intended to offer hope and guidance for any lady who wants to implement the RPW philosophy in her life but feels she may have arrived too late.  This is the second of a series of posts, and will be **most applicable to ladies ages 25 and up.**  Future posts will be dedicated to women who are married or in LTRs.

***

**First, I must sing the praises of “Nun Mode,”** which is a period of time (minimum 6 months) dedicated to self-improvement during which a woman completely foregoes dating. As with TRP’s [“Monk Mode,”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2qfw0e/guide_to_monk_mode/) the purpose is to obtain self-awareness and self-sufficiency.
If you’re pushing up against The Wall, you might think that you can’t afford the time spent in Nun Mode. I say that you can’t afford not to go into Nun Mode. In particular, there are two problems that Nun Mode can help overcome:
  
* If you have a history of serial monogamy (or what TRP would call “monkey-branching”), each man you choose may simply be a reaction to his predecessor. For example, if your last boyfriend was an unemployed party boy, a guy who is a teetotaler workaholic might at first be attractive and refreshing, until you get frustrated with the fact that on the rare occasions he takes you out on a date, he glares at you for ordering a glass of wine. 
* After a constant stream of heartbreak and disappointment, dating will start to feel like a desperate and tedious chore, akin to going on job interviews when your rent is already a month past due. You start to wonder [“where have all the good men gone”](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen/) when the reality is that you wouldn’t know them if you saw them.

The space, self-care, and learning experiences provided by Nun Mode are essential to fixing a broken “people picker.” You will be able to consciously choose a partner based on his individual merits, love him for who he is (not the gap you’re trying to fill), and spare him the trouble of repenting for another man’s sins. Moreover, time spent out of the dating market can help recapture the sense of joy and excitement that you used feel as a young girl at the prospect of meeting new people and falling in love.

**Second, one area that seems to be troublesome for RPWs (and those late to RPW in particular) is understanding the difference between being realistic about the type of man with whom you can be in a relationship and “settling” for a subpar mate.**

Being realistic is about being able to clearly and objectively assess both value and liabilities you bring to a relationship, and being able to manage your expectations accordingly. For example, if you’re 37 years old, you shouldn’t severely limit your dating pool by disqualifying men who have been married before or have children. If you like cookies more than the gym (and your waistline reflects this), you shouldn’t hold your breath waiting for shirtless Adonis who jogs by you every morning to ask you out and instead consider a coffee date from the cute but paunchy dude who chats you up in line at the bakery.

Settling, on the other hand, is done completely from a place of fear and is often based on low self-esteem rather than an objective assessment of your value or circumstances; it almost always just another exercise in poor judgment. One example of settling would be staying with a guy who habitually cheats on you because you’re a single mother and you’re simply grateful to have a man who is willing to be with you, despite the fact that you’re modeling an unhealthy relationship to your children, and you can’t effectively parent while in a constant state of anger and anxiety.  Another example of settling is dating a man with a string of baby mamas because you feel like your biological clock is ticking and you’re desperate to have a child, regardless of whether he is an optimal choice of co-parent.

*I will even go so far as to say that even if you’re a spectacular train wreck by any reasonable measure*— for example, you’re a unemployed crack addict with four kids by four different men, are host to a variety of STDs, and have an unmanaged personality disorder to boot—*then you still shouldn’t settle for any guy who would settle for you.* If you’re *that* far gone, do yourself and humanity a favor by being alone and focusing on becoming a safe and productive member of society.
 
The distinction between realism and settling tends to get the muddiest when dealing with one particular area of a relationship: sex. What do you do when you find a guy who is “good on paper” (i.e. great job, kind, loved by your friends and family, conventionally handsome), but for whom you feel no passion?

You might see it as a sign of maturity that you’re prioritizing other qualities (like hard-working, family-oriented, gets along with all your friends) over sexual attraction, but you’re actually being selfish and demeaning when you settle for a man that you don’t desire.  To reiterate a statement from my first post, **the most challenging thing about becoming an RPW is changing your focus from what you can get out of men to what you can offer them.** Do you really think that a man you don’t lust for or with whom you don’t enjoy sex is going to get the best you have to offer in a relationship?

Now, I’m not saying that you should follow the tingles in your vagina and nothing else. In fact, if your tingles have consistently led you toward douchebags, you need to sort that out while in Nun Mode. Instant, fiery attraction often burns out the quickest, which is why it’s worth taking some time with someone new and promising to see if an enduring passion might ignite.
 
But it’s safe to say that if you’ve been on several dates with a guy and his kiss doesn’t excite you or you’re not actively fighting the urge to eat the buttons off his shirt, do him and yourself a favor and move on. While it’s possible to reinvigorate passion that’s been lost in a relationship, you can’t bring back what was never there.

For further reading on this point, I must recommend [""Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough"" by Lori Gottlieb](https://www.amazon.com/Marry-Him-Case-Settling-Enough/dp/045123216X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513027359&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=marry+him+the+case+for+settling+for+mr.+good+enough). Yes, the title mentions the word ""settling,"" but what she's actually describing is how to set realistic expectations for what to expect in a mate, and not demanding that your spouse fulfill your every mental and emotional desire. Like, so what if your husband doesn't share your passion for crocheting. Don't you have friends for that?

**Lastly, I will address two common mistakes that women make when they’re vetting.** There are hundreds of possible mistakes, of course, but these seem to be the most common to “older” women:

* They put things in their dating profiles like “I don’t want a liar or a cheater,” “I don’t play games,” “Players need not apply,” “Abusers not wanted,” or “I’m just looking for a good man.” Even if they’re not online, they will say this stuff to a guy on a first date. 

They think that by saying this, they’re scaring away the bad men. The effect is actually the opposite… they’re advertising the fact that they’re damaged women with consistently bad judgment, which will attract precisely the type of men they’re hoping to repel. They spill blood in the water and then are bewildered when they’re attacked by sharks.

At the same time, decent men will read/hear statements such as the above, and (rightfully) conclude that the woman is bitter and has a ton of baggage with which they would rather not deal. Why date her when he can find a woman with a positive outlook who won’t immediately think the worst of him? Alternately, he might think that *she* is the one who is actually a drama queen, cheater, or abuser, and is projecting her own flaws on to the men she dates.

* Other women develop an increasingly long and arbitrary list of disqualifying factors that are completely unrelated to the fundamental of compatibility, such as shared values and a shared vision for the future. These are things like, “I can’t date a guy who makes less than six figures,” or “I can’t stand how he sings in the shower!”

In my personal opinion, women who do this are actually deeply insecure with themselves or have suffered from repeated rejection, so they invent flaws with every guy they meet and try to convince themselves (and others) that they are just “too picky.” It’s also a tactic to avoid any kind of painful but necessary circumspection. 

Of course, more often than not, all these “requirements” for a mate go out the window the minute they are lovestruck by Chad. Months later, when they’re back online, they write “I don’t want a liar or a cheater!” in their dating profile.

So how can you recognize a good man when you see him? The first thing to keep in mind is that people who are scumbags aren’t just scumbags in one area of their life; their duplicity and/or propensity for cruelty shows up in areas completely unrelated to romantic relationships. Here are some things to consider, though this list is by no means exhaustive:

* Does he follow through on his promises and obligations to others?
* Does he have integrity in his business and financial dealings? Or does he use illegal, unethical, or deceptive tactics to advance himself?
* Have you ever caught him lying?
* Does he talk down to people he regards as beneath him, such as employees or waitstaff? Or is he courteous to everyone regardless of their station?
* Does he omit things to avoid arguments? Or is he honest with you even when he knows you might get upset?
* Is he constantly overcompensating in order to impress people? Or does he seem comfortable in his own skin?
* Does he rush to the aid of a stranger or acquaintance in need at the expense of people close to him? Alternately, does he seem completely selfless and generous with people he doesn’t know well, but less so with people close to him? Or does he reserve his time and resources for those closest to him?
* Does he give off a “single vibe” with other women, or is he good at asserting boundaries?
* Does he [“love bomb” ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing) you or push to take the relationship to a serious level too early in the relationship? Or does he behave as if his commitment has value, and wants to get to know you well?
* Do his friends cheat on or otherwise mistreat their partners? Or does he surround himself with men who are in strong relationships and cherish their lady loves?
* Does he harp on the fact that all his exes were ""crazy"" or betrayed him? Or is he restrained in how he talks about his exes on the very rare occasions he mentions them at all?

The takeaway here is that men of good character demonstrate this to everyone, not just the women they’re trying to date. They don’t engage in virtue-signaling; being kind and respectful is just a natural part of their character, so they never even think to advertise it. Just as “I don’t want an abuser!” is a red flag to men, “I’m a nice guy” and “I want to treat a woman right” should be a red flag to women.

7gqsmu,"For Single Ladies “Late to the Red Pill” Part I: Motivations for being RPW, Facing the Wall, Dealing with N-Count","In a perfect world, all ladies would discover the Red Pill as fresh and dewy teenagers, ideally guided by the loving hand of traditionalist mothers. They would have dedicated their formative years to self-improvement and self-sufficiency, becoming proficient in the domestic arts, cultivating their feminine wiles, developing a unique and exquisite personal style, and saving themselves for the exceptional men who would become their husbands.

Alas, we do not live in this perfect world. Many stumble upon the Red Pill after the prime bloom of youth has been wasted on FWBs and focused purely on material success at the expense of personal happiness. Just as TRP newbies experience an “anger phase,” new RPWs often experience a “guilt and shame” phase when finally awakened to the reality of male and female relationship and sexual dynamics.

This post is intended to offer hope and guidance for any lady who wants to implement the RPW philosophy in her life but feels she may have arrived too late.  This is the **first of a series of posts,** and will be most applicable to ladies **ages 25 and up.** The first few posts will focus on single ladies; future posts will be dedicated to women who are married or in LTRs.

***

**First, what are your motivations for wanting to be an RPW?** If it’s because being on your own is too difficult and exhausting, and you just want someone to take care of you, then you’re in the wrong place. *The most challenging thing about becoming an RPW is changing your focus from what you can get out of men to what you can offer them.*


**Second, let’s take hard look at “the Wall.”** TRP defines the Wall as the point in a woman’s life (22-24 years old, if you ask Rollo Tomassi) when her SMV begins to decline.
 
In reality, most women do not wake up as undesirable hags on the morning of their 25th birthday. When and how quickly your SMV declines depends largely on factors within your control. Do you live a clean lifestyle and are mindful of your health and physical appearance, like [Rachel McAdams](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Rachel_McAdams_3.jpg/220px-Rachel_McAdams_3.jpg)? Or did you burn yourself out with smoking, hard drugs, binge drinking, and reckless behavior, like [Lindsay Lohan](http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/blogs/the-juice/lindsay-lohan-face-1.jpg)? 

From the RPW perspective, what the Wall actually represents *is a fundamental shift in power dynamics between men and women whereby the value of a man’s ability to provide commitment begins to exceed the value of a woman’s ability to provide access to sex.* This is why the guys you met in college were willing to transition from FWB to boyfriend, but the mature and established men you’re meeting now are unwilling to commit to you just to secure sex on tap.

*It’s imperative to adjust your dating strategy to emphasize your RMV.* What qualities do you have that are truly unique and remarkable? How will being in a relationship with you make his life better? In what areas are you fundamentally compatible?

The one advantage that you have over the younger bodies you may be competing with in the dating marketplace is that, at this point in your life, you should be secure and self-aware enough to be able to answer these questions and use your knowledge to hold a man's interest beyond the initial attraction phase.


**Third, how do you deal with your n-count?** Other than the Wall, there is perhaps no subject discussed in this forum that gets us ladies riled up more than n-count. If any talk of the “cock carousel” makes you feel defensive or doomed, know that *just because you can’t re-write your past doesn’t mean you can’t or shouldn’t control your present and future.* This means learning how to vet properly, controlling your impulses, and enjoying the rewards of delayed gratification.
 
If a man considers your n-count a deal-breaker, move on and don’t hold it against him. You’re not the right woman for him. If, on the other hand, a man expects no-strings-attached sex because you’ve done it in the past, you’re under no obligation to acquiesce. He’s not the right man for the woman that you are trying to become.

On the plus side, the older you are, the less likely you are to meet men who will outright ask you how many men you’ve slept with in the past. But that doesn’t mean that men won’t judge your sexual history in other ways. Have you cheated on your past partners? Were you ever a sidepiece? Were you ever pregnant? Do you have any children out of wedlock? Do you have or have ever had any STDs? Did you ever have sex with someone to advance yourself at school or work?

If confronted with these questions (either directly or in a roundabout way), you need to be upfront and honest—both with yourself and your prospective partners—about what you did, what led you to make such poor choices in the past, what you’ve learned, and most importantly, what you’re doing to prevent making such choices in the future. 

Yes, this means some guys might “next” you. But a willingness to be vulnerable and selfless, and not try to manipulate and control your partner’s feelings and reactions by lying or withholding information, is a necessary part of becoming the type of woman a man can love and trust. 

Besides, women who actually take responsibility for their mistakes instead of blaming men and society are in such short supply these days that some men might find such frankness and self-reflection to be rather refreshing.

6rsuh5,Appreciating random acts of male kindness,"I was at the gym today and was having some trouble setting up the equipment - the pins on some of the benches/racks have been slightly bent out of shape from use and so it takes a fair amount of banging around on them to get them to move sometimes. Both times two guys emerged out of nowhere to help me. The first guy didn't say a single word or make any eye contact and just walked away after (presumably because he didn't want to be ""that guy"" haha) and the other one was friendly and then just went back to his business. I was very grateful for their help and was thinking about how nice it is that we live in a world where men actually *want* to help us since it makes them feel good. It makes me feel like no matter what there will most likely be someone out there who will want to assist me if I'm in need and that's an amazing privilege to have. For a long time, I was annoyed by the guys around me for being so sex-driven - I hated having random guys stare at me, make creepy comments, or attempt to touch me. But today I am very grateful for the male species and appreciate that they feel this instinctual urge to protect or help a woman in need.

6qjgqm,Why he might consider marrying you.,"In days bygone, you had to marry to have sex. Therefore, a man who was interested in sex needed to try to impress a woman, court her and finally propose marriage. This has changed in all of the west except for certain religious communities. Today, premarital sex is the norm. If so, why would a man consider marriage? 

Additionally, marriage has become a huge liability for men. Alimony, child support, custody and rape allegations are all stacked against men. Men are still expected to fulfill all the traditional male obligations but are not to expect the same from their wives. Thus, marriage has become a raw deal for the average western man. 

It therefore stands to reason that if you want your man to marry you, he needs to have a very good reason for doing so. There needs to be something big in it for him. The benefits of marriage has to outweigh the potential risks. 

Men generally love to analyze things by a cost/benefit measure. If the benefits outweigh the costs, we're in. If the costs outweigh the benefits, we're out. The reason why so many men today are shunning marriage is because - in western society - the cost of marriage far outweighs the benefit for men. 

If you don't plan on having children, there's no reason to get married other than religious reasons. Just live together, love each other and commit to one another without the legal entanglement called marriage. If you do plan on having children, here are some things to consider. 

**Courtship** 

During this time, you vet one another to determine whether you're ready to live the rest of your lives together. It's wise to bring up all the big things early on. Be honest and straightforward. This is when you want every potential deal-breaker to emerge so you can go your separate ways if you aren't for each other. 

Your SMV will be quite apparent early on, it's your RMV that's now under scrutiny. This is what will take him some time to vet. 

It's my firm opinion that you should have no sex or sexual contact during this period of time. It's wiser and healthier to build a relationship that isn't blinded by pre/post sex hormones. Have sex when you reach the next stage. 

**Commitment** 

In my books, this is when you're married. Once you commit to each other. This is when you should engage in sexual activity. Go at it, don't hold back. The word appropriate means in the right place, at the right time, with the right person. Now that you're commuted to him, he fits the bill as an appropriate person to have sex with. 

Men are expected to bring home the bulk of the finances. Show him that you care about his money at every opportunity you have. When he's getting ready to commit, **insist** that you don't need a ring or any other fancy/expensive item. This will send him a message that you value his money. If he buys you a ring or any other expensive item, reiterate that it's truly unnecessary, be **very** grateful and extra loving as a sign of your appreciation. 

Yes, a ring is a traditional sign of your commitment. However, with today's different dynamics of marriage, a ring to a man is a financial cost that has little to no benefit to him. He may not readily admit to this (Especially if he fears your retaliation for telling the truth), but this is part of the reason for MGTOW. More and more men feel that things like a ring and big wedding are **expected** whereas things like sex are not to be expected. (Once again, the point of this post is to enumerate some of the things that make marriage more attractive or less attractive to men). 

**Marriage** 

You should be together for several years by now and only getting legally married because you're ready to have children. Full trust should be a given by now, but it shouldn't be assumed and expected indefinitely. Remember, marriage is still a raw deal for western men no matter how much he trusts you. If you want him to take the plunge, you ought to address his potential concerns by making it less of a potential raw deal. 

The first way to do this is to always keep him happy. You keep a man happy by keeping his balls empty, his stomach full and your mouth shut. That's it. Three simple things. Active, varied and passionate sex. Hearty, healthy and filling home cooked meals. And a woman who is pleasant to be around, who doesn't nag, whine, complain, cajole, threaten, bitch, ctiticize or offer ultimata. 

Next is to write up and sign a prenuptial agreement. You should each have your own legal representation and you should have the whole thing recorded by a professional videographer. You buy insurance for your house and car even though you plan on never using it, a prenuptial agreement is insurance for your marriage. Don't wait for him to raise the issue, you bringing it up will demonstrate your concern for his wellbeing. 

**Conclusion** 

Marriage is a raw deal for western men. Take steps to make it a better deal for your man if you want to make this decision more appealing to him. 

Cheers!

For ex. my bf and I have been talking about what type of homes we like, what types of decor, etc. he mentioned he really likes how pristine and put together hotels look, esp. their bathrooms. So I went into his bathroom and arranged his towels perfectly, not even a centimeter off (yes I'm a perfectionist haha).
Later we were brushing our teeth and when he went to dry his hands he just stopped for a moment and stared with his hand outstretched towards the towels. 

He was so happy! I was still brushing my teeth so I had to kick him out because he was ready to kiss me just like that. When I came out he was all kisses. :)

6o8i63,A man's honesty is a gift,"Hi everyone,

Today I want to talk about honesty. In this era of political correctness, being truly honest about how you feel and giving your opinions on topics that matter to you have been severely impeded because we're all afraid of offending someone. There is always *someone* who could take things the wrong way. Men *especially* need to keep their opinions to themselves. 

Society has always catered to women's sensibilities (which feminists don't want to acknowledge), but now, more and more topics are becoming off limits. *If* a conversation does arise, blue pillers try to steer it in a way that aligns with the feminist agenda, and incorporate things like ""misogyny,"" ""victim blaming,"" ""fat acceptance,"" you get the picture.

I gained 70+ lbs in 6 months from one of my medications (antipsychotic med). At 5'7, I used to be a healthy 145. I got up to 216 at my highest weight. This devastated me. Not only did I now have a pudgy stomach when previously it used to be flat and toned, my legs were like ham hocks, and I was covered in red, angry stretch marks. I looked in the mirror every morning and burst into tears. I felt so awful about myself that my hatred of my body combined with my self harm tendencies, and I tried to burn/cut off my fat. That's how bad it got. 

That's just on the subject of how I felt about myself. As far as physical impediments go, I now get asthma and vertigo when I try to exercise. I went to my doctor and I did prediabetic screening, and was told I needed to watch my blood pressure. I can't do even a fraction of the things I used to do anymore. 

I also noticed that men were looking at and approaching me less and less. It went from multiple times a day to zero within a few months. Maybe I'll get a smile here and there because I still have a pleasant face (no double chin, thank god), but still, the idea that my face is the only thing men want to look at is pretty depressing. 

I would try to express how I felt to my friends and immediately be shut down. It's so funny, feminists complain all the time about others invalidating their experiences, but it's something they are guilty of doing **all the time**. My friends would tell me ""You're not overweight! You're so beautiful! You don't need to change! You can be healthy at a bigger size! Men are stupid for not wanting to be with you! Don't listen to society's standards! Women don't need to look a certain way to be beautiful!""

...Yeah, I know. I know that they meant well, but all they did was invalidate my experience of being an overweight 21 year old woman who used to be healthy and attractive. They tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong when *everything* was wrong. I knew what they were saying wasn't true, but at the same time, I wanted *oh so badly* for someone to tell me I was okay. Guess what happened? None of the weight came off.

Enter the man I was dating recently. We met on a dating app (not Tinder, one that's actually meant for relationships). The one full-body picture I put on my profile was from two years ago. I told myself I uploaded it because it was a nice picture (me in a cute apron holding a pie I baked), but at least part of it was because I wasn't comfortable with anyone seeing what my body looked like now. 

He messages me, we hit it off, so we make plans for a date. We meet up, things seem to be fine, until we sit down to eat dinner. He says, ""you look a bit different than you did on your profile."" I ask him what he meant. He says, ""it looks like you've gained weight."" I get a sinking feeling in my stomach, but I tell him the truth, that I have gained a lot of weight since that one picture. He says, ""you're big, but you're pretty.""

My mouth flew open. I had **never** had someone be so blunt with me about my weight before. (He is not American, and where he's from, it's completely okay to comment on a person's weight. I didn't know this at the time, though.)

Anyway, I burst into tears in the middle of the restaurant and started packing up my things to leave. He stopped me and was very apologetic. He said that he didn't mean to hurt me, and if I'm going to be completely honest with myself, ***did he say anything that wasn't true?*** 

He then sat me down and told me that he believed I had tremendous potential. He was willing to help me lose the weight. He told me he wants me to go to the gym every day, no excuses. 

He is the only person who has motivated me to lose this weight, and has believed in my ability to do so. Everyone else just said that I was fine the way I was. He pushed me to improve, and he made me want to be the best version of myself. I had never met a man who has done that for me, until I met him. 

I dragged my feet a bit at first, but I made up my mind that I would lose a significant amount of weight when I went on vacation. 

**I LOST 7 POUNDS IN TWO WEEKS!** I didn't even feel like I was denying myself anything! I just cut down on carbs, loaded up on veggies, and got more active. Pretty simple, but man did it make a difference. 

I told my friends about how this guy was motivating me to lose weight, and you know what they said? ""Oh my god, he's an asshole, why would he ever say anything about your weight?! That's NOT okay. He should accept you for who you are."" When I told them I lost 7 pounds, they were soooo happy for me, but of course, they didn't give him any credit for his role in my losing the weight. 

The thing is, we ***don't*** want people to accept us for who we are. What if who we are is fat, lazy, unmotivated, etc.? People have the ability to change and improve, and you and your partner should always be striving to be better for yourselves and each other. 

When a man is truly honest with you and isn't trying to sugarcoat what he says, ***thank him***. It's a sign of respect. Unlike 90% of other women, he thinks you can handle it. The truth hurts, but you can turn that pain into motivation. That's what I did, and I'm not going to let anyone who thinks that he shouldn't have said anything about my weight stop me. If he hadn't, I would still be complacent and miserable. 

He and I needed to go our separate ways, but his honesty changed my life, and that's no exaggeration.

6nvade,I don't understand how Western men work,"I'm a Russian immigrant who grew up in Germany. My family raised me to be ""feminine"" but apparently Western feminism has destroyed the value of that. 

I was raised to believe that men and women are equal in the sense that both have to work hard, pursue higher education and get a good job. Soviet ideals, you know. But when it comes to relationships gender roles are essential: Girls have to look the best they can, it'll make them feel more confident and make her man proud to be with her. Guys have to demonstrate that they have what it takes to protect their families. Behavior that is gender-conforming isn't bad and no part is disadvantage. It's all about the psychology for women and tbh this approach is so much more powerful than the empowered feminist approach that assumes discrimination and oppression behind every word. In Russia the man's job is to protect but at home the woman makes the decisions.

But now I live in Germany where girls ask me if it's true that all Russian girls want is money because I don't dress like a lesbian. I wait for guys to approach me but the only ones who do are sleazy immigrants (No offense, it's just the truth.) Meanwhile, all the good guys get taken away by girls who put no effort into their looks and watch soccer with them. They tell them what to do and they obey. It's a disgusting sight. They don't commit and think that this compensates that they behave like henpecked douchebags. I don't want to just go up to guys and basically tell them to be with me but it seems like this is the only way things work here. Also I hate how things are about sex here while commitment scares them away like it's AIDS or something.

Phew, finally found a place where I can vent! I often feel like I'm the worst racist or whatever because I'm not celebrating this system where men aren't men anymore and everyone sleeps around. I just feel so lost and don't know how I can find a guy that can make me feel like a woman and support me like a real man without fear of things getting serious (because that's what I want).",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/6nvade/i_dont_understand_how_western_men_work/,1500318705.0,91,0.94,91,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
6n4csz,Promiscuity and pair bonding,"Hi everyone,

I posted here for the first time last week, and I just wanted to thank everyone who commented for their insightful and constructive advice. I loved how honest you ladies were with me.

Anyway, I was prompted to write this post after watching Lauren Southern's ""What Every Girl Needs to Hear"" video (go watch it if you haven't already). She discusses how promiscuity has a detrimental effect on a woman's ability to pair bond with a partner.

To all of my fellow college RPW out there, *please*, don't let **anyone** convince you that you're missing out by not riding the CC. Maybe you're like one of my best friends, who has been in a committed relationship with a great guy for a few years, but you see your friends going out and meeting new guys every weekend and wonder if you should be doing that too, because that's what modern society dictates college-age women should be doing. It bothered her so much that she considered asking her boyfriend to open up the relationship, even though they've talked about marriage. **That's how brainwashed our generation has become.**

As someone whose n-count is in the 20s, I told her, point blank: **it's not worth it**. 

I mentioned in my last post that I have bipolar, and that I am hypersexual when I'm manic. This resulted in my count going from 1 to 20+ in a matter of 6 months. All of these were hookups.

**9 times out of 10, guys who want to hook up with you DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. AT ALL.**

You're just a plate to them, no matter how nice they seem to be. That's the *best case scenario*. There are also men out there who can seriously hurt you. I was raped by one last year. That just goes to show the kind of people you can come across when you venture into the world of meaningless sex. They have no regard for your feelings, or, in some cases, your personal safety.

Given my high n-count, I feel that sex isn't as special to me anymore. I have to actively try to feel the connection with my partner, when previously it came naturally and effortlessly. I can still feel it, but it doesn't feel as strong as it did before. 

Also, I can't help comparing my current partner to all of the partners I've had in the past. It keeps me from truly enjoying everything he has to offer.

Don't sabotage your ability to pair bond just so you can fit in with your blue pill friends. Sex is very important to men (and women, too). For most men, it's how they feel most connected with their partner. Like men, I also primarily prefer giving and receiving love through physical intimacy, and now I feel like my ability to receive has been compromised. Trust me, you *don't* want to be in my shoes.

I know it's highly unlikely for a woman in this day and age to save herself until marriage or have a count of 1 unless it is in the context of a religious upbringing, but at least try to limit your sexual encounters to men you are in committed relationships with. It's not just because of retaining your ability to pair bond, or keeping your RMV high, but simply put, **sex is better with someone you love and who loves you**. 

My fellow young RPW, don't sell yourself short.

6lwkfg,An almost hilarious transformation,"Hello, my name is Goddess_of_Light, and I'm a recovering riot grrrrrrl SJW Feminazi.

I say that with all sincerity. I was the girl with the buzz cut, nose ring, boy clothes, nasty attitude, 2 divorces, no college degree working in the restaurant industry, single 1/2 time mom, and not awesome personal hygiene. So, what happened? Jeez.

I met a man. Like, THE man. He is a man's man. He's a therapist, woodworker, fisherman, strong absurdly attractive fit American-Italian, ruthless honesty, integrity, leadership, a house, a boat, ALL of it. Like, the total package. He's 30 and never been married, no kids. And in spite of all the things above he picked me. The way he recounts it, he said he saw something special when I played music in front of him (the one place I had allowed my true feminine power to actually come out).

I've been lurking this site for months. I've read The Surrendered Wife. I listen to Alison Armstrong like my life depends on it. I think the craziest thing is, by being with a man like him, I started naturally gravitating into becoming the woman I am today.

 It's like, I intuitively wanted to please and support him even though it went against EVERYTHING I grew up believing and had bought into. I slowly allowed him to be the Man (because he's the kind of man who essentially just commands that with his presence) and I naturally fell into becoming a woman. I'm completely sexually available, not from a place of obligation, but from pure joy. I dress and act feminine, even dyed my hair blond and lost 15 pounds. Took out the nose ring. Got a job at a law firm. I keep the home spotless. I support him at every turn without being critical. I am receptive to all of his gifts (even when they don't look the way I ""think"" they should) And the fucking insane part is how much I enjoy it. Like, I'm so happy. 

There is still, however, this internal conflict that pops up. I suppose it's natural after living with rigid feminist ideologies for as long as I did. I started looking for answers and stumbled across Alison Armstrong, who explains the biologies of the sexes and how to work within that framework - and I was so ANGRY because she was so RIGHT! But, the evidence is clear. In my relationship. I didn't know LTR bliss like this existed. I didn't know just how much I was craving to be taken care of and to embrace the power within my femininity. These things may have become intuitive at some level, but I'm hungry for more.

I'm starting to really grasp how much of a fluke it was that I landed the package deal, and I am determined to rise to the occasion. There is still that small SJW voice (He's not trying to be helpful, he's trying to insult you!) that tries to derail me, so I come here with an open-mind and mild apprehension.

I've read these posts and you are some of the most caring, dedicated, supportive, considerate AND accountable, non-victim, courageous women I've ever seen. I am so inspired, and I'm committed to becoming the best version of myself and fully embracing all of these things that still seem amazing, but so foreign to me. I would be honored to be a part of this community and to learn and grow with you wonderful women.

That was a super round-a-bout way of introducing myself, but I want all of you to know just how excited I am that I have found my people!

6k7y4y,Childlike vs. Childish,"My boyfriend has a friend, who is in his 50's. He married a woman much younger than him, she's 29. While she's gorgeous and youthful, they fight. A LOT. Predominantly because the age difference is too big, and she hasn't caught on to what her responsibilities should be.

For example, yesterday they had to take a flight in the evening to France. The husband was working in the morning and began packing in the afternoon.

Wife is out hanging with her girlfriend and returns home 1.5 hours before departure. She hasn't packed. Ensue big argument between the couple since she's acting like an irresponsible child when she's almost 30. Apparently she needed him to tell her what time to come home and what she needed to do, she couldn't think for herself and think like an adult.

While this example might be extreme (since there's a 25 year age gap), it's still proves true that even when a man wants a submissive, youthful wife, you will still irritate him by being childish and irresponsible.

*Childlike* is different than *childish.* *Childlike* is when you are open to life's opportunities, are fearless, excited, optimistic. *Childish* is being irresponsible, unmanageable, stubborn, immature.

Wives need to be feminine, radiant but also functional. The key is not to let your functionality overrun the relationship (bossy, naggy). How can RPW maintain your childlike optimism while still being functional?

1) **Childlike affection.** Ever seen a little girl hug a puppy, or kiss her parents? Or beg her daddy for a piggy back ride? Giggle when someone harmlessly teases her? She's open with her emotions, she's not afraid to show her love. She gives her affection to those that are dear to her.

2) **Childlike enjoyment.** Think about a little girl eating ice cream, enjoying her favorite lasagna, putting on a pair of beautiful earrings, painting her nails, singing along to her favorite song. She's happy about the simple things in life. She's uninhibited with the pleasures of the world.
Any good woman knows how to control her emotions - to switch from being functional to being childlike, and a talented RPW knows how to assess which situation requires which quality.

6flwyx,One man's reply to my post about living together before marriage.,"I posted in an FB group on what people thought about cohabitation before marriage.

'Everyone is different, so I would never tell someone ""No,"" but I will elaborate on why I loved living apart.
1.) It built the anticipation and excitement like you wouldn't believe.
2.) It literally made the marriage a life changing event. So many people get married and say it's ""same old, same old."" That was not our case.
3.) ""I do"" set in motion a new chapter of our relationship. My girlfriend became my wife, and we embarked on exploring each other on newer and more romantic depths than ever before.
4.) I was burning my escape bridge. If we found us to be incompatible, we would have to adapt to one another and grow together-for each other.

6b6u7e,confessions of a liberal RPW aka why I enjoy RPW,"**DISCLAIMER**: I'm quite new to RPW and do not claim to speak for any other member of this community. I barely qualify as a member of the community ;p I merely want to offer up my thinking and my perspective so that other people who are trying to make up their mind about RPW can hear from someone who maybe isn't who they'd expect to find. 



**ABOUT ME (the political stuff)**: I'm as blue state as they come. I campaign passionately for progressive causes, especially those that pertain to equal access to opportunity for women. I truly do not mean to break community rules and say anything negative about TRP so suffice to say I agree with very, very little of that subreddit's content. 

I have an intense career about which I am very passionate. I hope to change the world for the better in a big way. I never planned to live a life characterized by ""traditional 50's gender roles"". I live what I hope is an independent, adventurous, big, worldly life. 


**SO WHY RPW? **


**1)** RPW is not as prescriptive as I thought. 

I don't want to dive into the entomological debate around ""what a community"" is defined by. But there are plenty of women who contribute to RPW who are not SAHM, who don't live ""super traditional"" lives. To me, RPW is not an ideology that seeks to dictate its members' choices. Or at least, I've never felt any pushback because I live the way I do. 

**2)** I want an all-female space where I can celebrate the feminine.


RPW is a place where I can celebrate my femininity and fully relax and be my girl-iest self. There aren't a lot of other communities for me where that's the case. Girlishness is usually seen as ditziness, shallowness. I love my feminist spaces too but it's hard to gush about your BF without being seen as boring, lame, unintellectual. I brood a lot on the phrase ""a servant's heart."" That's an ideal that transcends femininity and masculinity but has a particular relationship with the feminine, and it's one I consciously want to cultivate. I seek to be nurturing, un-egotistical, supportive, to want to **serve** my darling life partner. Not all men, not men in general, not ""men"" the political idea...my man.

**3)** I want a space where I can celebrate the domestic.


Similarly, I love being in a space where we can celebrate and honor the little things - a well-cooked meal shared with the people you love, decorating a house to make it a home, choosing some gentle words carefully to soothe a spouse. Workaholic or not these little domestic moments make up **so much of our lives**... and so much of the time we share with our families. I love that this community takes them seriously, honors this kind of work properly, acknowledges its importance. 

When you think of cleaning as a chore you hope your boyfriend does for you...that's what it is. An opportunity to fight, to complain, to be exhausted. When you think of cleaning as a political moment....that's what it is. A chance to stand on a soapbox (don't get me wrong, I love soapboxes haha). 

But being part of RPW makes me think of these little things --tidying up our closet, doing the dishes--as a chance to embody love, devotion, a chance to enact higher principles. That kind of thinking makes those moments beautiful. And that makes my whole life more beautiful. 



**4)** I want a space where we can acknowledge painfully realistic things without being accused of being sexist or offensive.



I think people hear terms like ""the wall"" or ""dread game"" they assume they're *moral* statements or *instructions*. I see them as observations. To me, RPW isn't about *instructing* people to not date older women who are ""past the wall"", it isn't about *instructing* women or men to employ ""dread game."" FOR ME, TRP is about merely recognizing that it is harder to date past a certain age, that psychologically that adjustment can be dangerous (for instance). TRP is about recognizing that ""dread game"" works often, is employed, etc etc.


I believe that underneath the civility and euphemisms of polite society, people are actually driven by the considerations TRP describes. And it's fun for me to acknowledge these harsh considerations and dynamics without being met with a horrified gasp.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/6b6u7e/confessions_of_a_liberal_rpw_aka_why_i_enjoy_rpw/,1494802718.0,75,0.91,41,RedPillWomen,tempintheeastbay
6aumug,FR: My Husband F***ed Up Today...,"Ok so the title is a little click-baity but I could't help myself. :-) So let me give y'all a little background first so you understand the eff up...


 I've been trying to strike a good balance between my work and home life. I need to work part time to help make ends meet and provide breathing room in our budget. I work in healthcare and I'm per diem which means I set the hours I want to work, when, how many, what day, etc. Its a sweet deal, I work at a skilled nursing facility so there's always tons of hours available and I just get to pick and choose what I want. My husband works regular office hours and I'm second shift so I can stay home with the baby (9 months old today!!) and that way he isn't in daycare. However if I work 3 nights a week, I see less of my husband. Its a trade off. This week, I decided to try and work two ""doubles (aka 16 hour shifts) to get all my hours into 2 days. So I worked from 3p Monday afternoon until 7am Tuesday morning and Thursday night to Friday morning. I nap when the baby naps and its definitely tolerable. 


 LB (Little Boy) Dunham is on a feeding schedule like most babies his age. He's getting pretty good at sleeping through the night. Before I left for work on Monday I explained the schedule and went to work. Well they slept through a feeding and got it three hours late so LB woke me up after only an hour of sleep. I talked to Mr. Dunham again, told him what happened and explained the importance of the schedule. Well the same thing happened again this morning. This time I was pissed. 
*Why is it that I can keep the schedule and he can't? I feed the baby every single night, he can't do it while I'm at work?! I have to work AND take care of the house! Doesn't he get how tired I am?!*
 And I could have yelled all these things at him. I'd definitely have a right to. I think every woman here that has a child completely understands my anger. I had worked *sixteen* hours and then had to come home, barely fall asleep only to be woken up by a hungry baby who was very happy to see me. 


 
 Instead, I erased the nasty text message I was planning on sending him and instead said, ""LB tells me you didn't feed him this morning."" To which he apologized and said he totally forgot, he had set an alarm but it didn't go off for whatever reason. I didn't feel I could say anything nice, so I didn't say anything else about it. Tonight when he got home he apologized again and promised he'd get it right for next week. 

 The whole point of this FR is that there is no grand closure to this story. I don't work again until next Monday. The point is that even though it should have been a simple task and he screwed up twice and really inconvenienced me is that I still love him and he's still my husband. We all make mistakes, we all screw up. I had an expectation that he would do something and he failed, twice. But that doesn't make him a failure and it doesn't make him incompetent. Just because my husband makes mistakes doesn't mean he isn't trustworthy. I could have raked him over the coals and I'm pretty sure he expected it, but I value the harmony in our marriage more than being right and making sure he knows it. Consequently, he told me the fact that I didn't yell made him feel worse, especially when he walked in the door tonight and saw how exhausted I looked. 

 There isn't always a happy, rosy ending. Sometimes our husbands fail and just suck at doing things. Be RPW anyway. Its not always easy or always fair or always rewarding but that's life my dears. I'll make up the sleep tonight, but the damage my harsh words could have done to our relationship and his confidence as my captain could have lasted for far longer than that. 

Treasure your husband, treasure your marriage.

684d4l,This sub has changed my life,"Long time lurker but I have been having so much success and understanding of my life and relationships the past few years that I wanted to share.

I used to run with a moderately liberal crowd (no land whales or crazy hair or piercings, but mainly attractive single girls who were career oriented) and I was always so confused as to what I wanted in life and in relationships. Late-20's now.

My girlfriends and I tended to be ambitious and also let our ambitions define us first and foremost. One of my girlfriends is the founder and CEO of a nonprofit and she will let you know all about her successes when you meet her. I was also one of those ""charity oriented free spirit"" girls in my mid-20's that wanted to do good for the world to create my self worth. However I was socially awkward because all I could talk about were my projects and I wasn't really a fun girl to be around. Little did I realize that guys flocked to the girls who were able to have a good time and be a good companion, not shove their moral stance on the world down your throat (my girlfriends did this too).

I've better understood my role the past few years, I work full-time and I still do a kickass job at the office but the difference is outside the office, I can be a real person and enjoyable company. And now I have an amazing boyfriend who has been discussing marriage! Also I keep in touch with my girlfriends (who are still single) and now I really understand why they're single. Even if they're fun to be around with, they have an inflated sense of self worth because of their jobs. My nonprofit friend will sigh, look at her watch, and say she has to do ""CEO things"" when she's bored of other people. My other friend thinks she's waaaaay smarter than everyone she knows, she's really aggressive and condescending, says everyone is stupid, gets impatient, doesn't let guys do things for her because they always do things ""wrong."" Her 5 year LTR just suddenly ended and the guy has not tried to reconcile with her at all.

I feel like I can pinpoint exactly why women are single nowadays! It's just so fascinating to see what the actual reasons are and most of them are due to entitlement and overly inflated sense if worth. Also things like not being soft and fun to be around. My friend always complains after she goes on dates that she didn't have any enjoyment because she was criticizing the guy in her head. And funny enough, ever since I've changed, I've gotten asked out SO much and by really high quality guys, ones who are intelligent, attractive, and successful (before my current boyfriend).

66gxsa,In Which I Refute The Vice Article,"Article in question: http://archive.is/oybLW


&gt; RedPillWomen is the ""feminised"" version of the infamous RedPill—a men's rights subreddit whose members claim to have ""taken the red pill"" and finally realised the truth about feminism. Namely that it shouldn't exist.


*Dun dun dun!* I can just hear the scary music the reader is supposed to hear after being confronted with such a controversial statement. *There are people on Earth who don't identify as feminists? The horror!*


I think this would be a good time to point out that RPW is in many ways and by definition an extremely feminist space, we just don't subscribe to the particular ""brand"" of feminism that is culturally popular now. [Pic Related.](http://i.imgur.com/C2eZrgK.jpg)


&gt; every Red Pill Woman I reached out was careful and reluctant to talk with me. ""In general, the only interest we see from writers is in gathering material for a hit piece,"" one said.


Upon locating and befriending some members of a teeny-tiny online community of women that feel vulnerable to journalists writing hit pieces about them, our feminist author *proceeds to write a hit piece.*


&gt;  ...there's a pink background and cursive font...a online home for thousands of defeated women...They didn't see themselves as the hot girl...*chamber of bigoted secrets!*


This is [so transparent](http://i.quoteaddicts.com/media/q2/1176371.png), but we must be doing [something right](http://emilysquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/A-boy-makes-his-girl-jealous-of-other-women.-A-gentleman-makes-other-women-jealous-of-his-girl..jpg).


&gt; I called myself electricwoman9.


Come on PluggedInPollyanna, if you're going to infiltrate a den of internet misogyny at least come up with a good handle.


&gt; Lauren ... She had made a conscious decision to ""embrace being nice… as a woman"", as she believed she was then ""more likely to get a positive reaction than by being aggressive.""


I have to point out that the ellipsis means we have no idea what exactly Lauren said.


But who knew that being nice got you a more positive reaction than being aggressive! That's not manners or common sense, that's internalized misogyny!


Then there's a discussion of LMR. As we all know, RPW is filled with posts in which we advise our fellow women on how to overcome their LMR. Oh wait it's not, and the only person from here nice enough to talk to the author refutes this claim for us.


&gt; ""These terms are not really used on RedPillWoman. It is assumed that those who are reading it are aiming to find long term relationships with men.""


Which is really the point, isn't it--the author has pretty much misconstrued what RPW is. This is a forum for relationship advice without a feminist bent. It's not *that* scary.


&gt; Perhaps there is some comfort in convincing oneself that you aren't an oppressed person.


There is. There is also some comfort in convincing yourself that you *are* an oppressed person, but only one of these puts you in an empowered position.


RPW is a tiny sub, our main focus is helping people find and keep a man they're attracted to, not apologizing for rape or any of the other nonsense you wrote here.

643kak,Relationship market value vs Sexual market value: some traits to consider,"Hey RPW. There have been a couple of posts lately about specific traits that make a woman commitment-worthy (ie that contribute to your Relationship Market Value, or RMV), not just date-worthy or sex-worthy (Sexual Market Value, SMV), in the eyes of a quality man. 

I think lots of new RPW get caught up in the surface trappings that improve their SMV (like longer hair, wearing more dresses, and baking more). But what are the things men consider important when looking for a commitment-worthy partner? 

This post is adapted from a long reply I wrote in a locked thread. I'd love to hear further suggestions. 


*  Being polite and non-argumentative in public and in private. No one wants to feel like they're being argued at. This is especially important for RMV because you need to be a strong team if you're considering having children.

*  Attitude towards children/skills appropriate for motherhood. Many men, even the ones who don't want children now, watch women for signs that a woman would be a good mother. That means kindness, honesty, consideration of other people's needs, as well as actually being interested in having kids (if relevant).

*  Ability to maintain close relationships with friends and family. This doesn't mean having 15 acquaintances you see each week for drinks, it means having a couple of close friends that you can turn to when you need tough love (for example, when you're having trouble dating) and who you're there for in their time of need. Family is obviously more tricky (you only get one, and sometimes they're not worth having a relationship with), but most men will understand if you don't have a relationship with your family (if it's for a good reason) as long as you've demonstrated the ability to maintain close friendships. Being able to maintain long-term close relationships is a sign of loyalty, a key trait in romantic relationships.


*  Being considerate of other people's needs. This means their ACTUAL needs, not what you *think* their needs are. Sometimes a man needs quiet, alone time. Sometimes he needs to feel like a king in his own home. Sometimes (often) he needs a steak and a BJ. Sometimes he needs home baking! 

*  Being aware in social situations. This means 'reading the room', noticing when people are getting stressed/reactive, and smoothing things over where possible. An example of this: I had to go to a family function last weekend, and I was upset/frustrated for a couple of reasons (I tried to keep it hidden but I wasn't doing the best at it). My aunt, at the event, noticed I was upset and gave me a cup of tea and distracted me by asking about my latest home improvement activity. She 'read' my emotional state and helped improve it, a great skill. 

*  Being respectful and socially appropriate in public. A man doesn't get shamed when his FWB is obnoxious at a party, but a husband will absolutely be ashamed if his wife is playing up (getting drunk, or long-winded) and making people bored/uncomfortable. For an example, consider the Bennet sisters from Pride and Prejudice (a classic, and relatively easy to read if you haven't already). At a social situation, Kitty and Lydia were giddily flirting and acting like sexed-up teenagers. Mary was at the opposite end of the spectrum, being boring and stuffy and making everyone listen to her singing. In contrast, Jane and Elizabeth were making polite conversation, listening to the people around them, and participating in the dance. Who ended up pumped-and-dumped by an officer? Who ended up the last daughter left at home and single? And who ended up married to good men? 

* Flexibility to listen and change your view when new information appears.  By being open to change and learning, you show that you're a good partner and team-mate. Example: my husband wanted a particular breed of dog. I was worried because everything I read on the internet indicated that this breed of dog is high exercise - and we don't exercise that much, especially not in dog-friendly ways (ie not the gym). BUT: I was open to learning and changing my view, and after talking to a huge number of dog owners of this breed, going to dog shows, etc, I came to agree with him, and we're getting the dog :)

* Ability to self-analyse and self-improve. This doesn't just mean the surface stuff, like 'lose two points of BMI' or 'be better at baking', this means honestly reflecting on your life (including work, relationships, and other endeavours) and identifying your flaws, and then working to resolve them. Whether this means journalling, therapy or simply talking to a good friend about how you can improve, being open to change and growth is important over the life of a relationship. 


*  Being interested in HIM, not just wanting a relationship. Men can tell when you're just trying to find someone to marry, rather than being interested in them as a human. Are you interested in HIS opinions, HIS activities, HIS life? It's not about you wanting a relationship, it's about you wanting HIM, and he can damn well tell if you're just playing the field. Most men would prefer a 6-7 who thought he was a god to a 9-10 who thought he was okay. 

I'm most definitely not perfect, and struggle with some of these even now! I'd love to hear what other traits you think are important to RMV, compared to SMV.

63bhbz,Entitlement,"Once upon a time, society had rules. Among those rules were rules surrounding marriage. Looking back into history from our perspective, these marriages of old seem more like business deals than like the love and romance we like to dream about. Problem is, we haven't fully moved to a world where marriage is defined by love and romance (and we never will). Thus, we now have a really messed up idea of marriage where we are appalled at the idea of obligation while still feeling entitled. 

**Marriage of old**

Men and women get married for different reasons. We each have needs and desires which we seek to fulfill by getting married. Some of the actual desires are the same but their rank within the hierarchy of desires is not the same. 

(Obviously, your personal millage may vary because both men and women have masculine and feminine character traits, it's just that men are generally more masculine and women are generally more feminine. There are masculine women and feminine men out there. This post will speak in general terms. By ""men"" I mean most men or the more masculine version of humanity and likewise with regards to ""women"".)

In the days of old, it was not socially acceptable to have sex outside of wedlock. Did it happen? Of course it happened, but it was unacceptable and therefore happened much less and more hidden. Because of this, if you wanted to have a regular sex life, you had to get married. This was true for most people. Since sex is higher up on the list of needs for men, this practically meant that men had to accept marriage in order to have regular sex. There were parts of marriage which he may not have been particularly interested in or perhaps he was indifferent to these parts or even opposed to them, but this was the trade off, he committed to these elements in exchange for regular sex. 

Same was true in the reverse. Maybe sex wasn't as important to the woman as it was for her husband. Maybe she would have been okay with half the amount of sex as what he wanted. Maybe she didn't need it altogether. But his happiness, his ongoing commitment and support were extremely important to her and so, in exchange for that, she had more sex than what she would have had if it all went according to her desires. 

It's true that there were miserable men and women back then, there always are. However, to a very large degree, this worked. Men had to prioritize what was important to their wives and women had to prioritize what was important to their husbands. It was a trade-off and everyone knew it and was open about it being a trade-off. But once the terms and conditions were agreed upon, it was **expected** of both parties to keep their end of the deal. Not upholding your end was grounds for divorce while getting the lower hand in the process. 

**New age marriage**

According to modern thought, nobody owes anything to anyone (except when they do). This is especially true with regards to the obligations of a wife towards her husband. ""It's my body and I don't owe him sex"" is heard quite often. Similar sentiments are sounded with regards to many other issues. (**I'm not here to debate the issues themselves so if you're here to troll, you can leave now**). 

OTOH, certain entitlements remain, especially when the marriage doesn't work out and the couple divorces. This is destructive to marriage. As much as we'd like to believe in love and romance, reality is that people want to give and receive within a marriage. When one party feels like they're only giving and not receiving anything in return, they feel taken advantage of and the marriage breaks down from there. 

Masculinity and femininity are meant to balance each other to create a harmonized marriage, family, community and world. When we each play to our strengths and work in tandem, our marriages, families, communities and the world at large will be a much more wonderful place to live in. When we work against each other, we experience a breakdown in marriages, families, communities and the world. This us vs them mentality helps no one. It's destructive to everyone. 

**Taking responsibility**

We can't change the world, but we can change ourselves. We can treat our own spouses in a manner where we work together, our positives balance out the negatives of our spouses. We encourage and support one another and live a great life. The key to this in a world gone haywire on marriage is to do the exact opposite as what caused the problem to begin with. 

The problem began when the feminist movement sought to liberate women from male oppression. Let's examine this statement without getting sidetracked by whether women were or weren't oppressed in the 50's because that's besides the point. This statement assumes that traditional marriage is oppressive to women and that men are the oppressors. It seeks to pit men and women against one another, thus breaking down the family unity. It also assumes that the old version of marriage was all obligations for women while being all benefits to men. This is not true. As explained above, marriage of old was a trade-off which was actually negotiated in great detail in many cultures. 

If the problem is that people wish to shirk responsibility while reaping the full benefits, the solution is to do the opposite, to provide the full benefits by fulfilling our full responsibility without expecting immediate returns. Many of the seasoned women here can attest to their successes which occurred only after they were consistent in sticking to their end of the deal while giving their men the space to catch up when they were ready. 

**Conclusion** 

Ask not what my husband/wife can do for me, ask what you can do for them. Live your married life in full devotion to your spouse without expectation of anything in return. 

If a period of time passes and they are only taking and taking and are taking you for granted, perhaps it's time to consider divorce. When the basics of the marriage are in place but your guys just got a little sidetracked in the bickering, one spouse can break the vicious cycle by doing their part consistently. The other spouse will usually catch up after a few months. However, if they don't catch up and just take you for granted, it may be a sign that the foundations are shattered beyond repair. 

Take a step forward and improve your marriage today! If you aren't married yet, take a step forward and improve your RMV today!

Cheers!

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4333200/The-agony-beautiful-faithful.html

This woman is not even that attractive. She is just so spoiled and delusional that she justifies her hypergamy by telling everyone it's because she is so attractive. She begins by saying that she is more attractive than the man she married, but as you can see from their wedding photo, he is actually quite attractive. I think I am a lot prettier than this woman and I do not share the same feelings as her regarding faithfulness. Thankfully, if you read the comments most people are shaming her. However, a lot of people are supporting her idea that attractiveness can mean you have a smaller chance at monogamy.

She also goes on to brag about how attractive her parents were, as though attractiveness is solely based on your genetics and has nothing to do with how well you take care of yourself inside and out. Unfortunately, she is not the only woman who shares this delusion as I have seen it elsewhere. It is disgusting and needs to stop.

60p6l4,Moving towards being more feminine,"I'd just spent the last few months running myself ragged to prepare for an important set of exams, and they finally finished, leaving me with a sense of happiness and a fever.

I recovered yesterday and today I took a couple of steps into making myself feel amazing. First things first, I finally got my eyebrows done, and the difference is enormous!! I had a unibrow till today, but not anymore!

Then, on the way back, my mom wanted to do a bit of grocery shopping. While she was picking up vegetables, I spotted this batch of mushrooms which seemed to call to me. I immediately picked them up.

And today, for the first time in my life, I stepped into the kitchen, and with my mother's guidance, made a mushroom chilli fry for dinner. Felt amazing while doing it.

But the real icing on the cake was serving a cup of coffee to my father after a long day at work, having him say that it was just like how my mother made it for him, and serving the dish to both my parents. Hearing their praises was a fitting end to my day, and my first cooking attempt. 

So while I drown myself in education and grabbing a degree and well paying job, it pays to sometimes invest in soft skills like this. I cannot stress on how self sufficient I felt, so much that I declared that next time, I'd make a mushroom dish on my own!

5ylvgs,Analogy for what men look for in women,"Hey everyone!

So my friend and I were discussing relationships and fantasizing about the ideal man. Then we realized how vividly we knew how the ideal man would make us feel, but had absolutely no idea how men want to feel in presence of their ideal woman. I write ""feel"" because all of the desired traits in a partner basically result in a positive feeling (warmth, comfort, passion etc.) 

So women want to feel protected, small, coddled, adored in the presence of a man. The man is basically an ideal version of a father.
So what feeling does an ideal woman inspire in a man?



The same feeling you get when you are petting your purring cat. Or dog. Or whatever animal that adores you and can express that affection in a way, that you can pick up and identify.

This is the perfect analogy for me and here's why:

After a long day, I come home and I honestly don't want to talk for the first 10 minutes. 
I lie down on my sofa, and a cat jumps on my lap and lies down. It purrs. It's warm. It's so cute. It's affectionate. It asks no questions. No ""Can you do this for me?"", ""What do you want for dinner?"", not even ""How was your day?"" I tell you, I don't even want to hear or answer considerate and caring questions right then. ALL I want in those first 10 minutes is to zone out. 

Now the cat analogy applies for other moments as well. During depressing and hopeless times, I personally don't feel the need to TALK about it, and I don't think men do either. I even want to avoid talking about it, because there is nothing to say, and it hurts thinking about it. What I want is to FEEL affection and support from my loved ones. And that is expressed through touch, through vibes. The cat would just hug me, and not say a word. It would purr. And I'd be in a healing trance. 

So when you try to emulate the ideal woman, and try to engineer an atmosphere that is most pleasing to your man, be the cat.

When you feel happy with yourself, you will radiate that and people will want to be around you. And hey you may find Mr Right while you are enjoying yourself. *not like that* LOL. Couldn't help it.

Because a man wants to be a part of a woman's life that has all that. He doesn't want to give her a life, he wants to add to it. 

Do something in the next week for you. Last week I got my hair done for first time in months... And let me tell you, I feel so great about myself! People are starting to notice because just by that simple act, my mood is lighter, I'm smiling and laughing more. 

Because I feel confident with myself, people want to be around that! When you look good, you feel good! 

But remember, it's not all about the physical. While you are working on your exterior, don't forget about what matters most: Personality. Read some books, teach yourself something new.. but most importantly be kind and have courage.*

5x5a5h,Need help with anger phase,"Please.  

I've been experiencing basically the female version of the anger phase.  I'm angry that society taught me to repress all of my natural instincts and desires.  I'm angry I have no choice but to work in a very masculine environment.  I work hard but I wish I didn't have to go against my nature.  I can feel the stress hurting my body. 

I'm angry that men are understandably afraid of marriage since feminism and no-fault divorce. 

I'm angry my parents' divorce hurt my ability for love.  I'm angry most of my 20s were occupied with dealing with their lawsuits and flack and helping my younger siblings out of there, leaving me little time to seek a husband. I love my bf but I know if we met younger I would be less stressed about my own age. 

I'm angry the women in my family are so angry at men and taught me terrible things about men. 

I'm angry my schools spent so much energy in sex ed essentially teaching it in a way that suggested we were supposed to be promiscuous (one professors literally said he ""hoped women would be promiscuous"" for their own freedom or something.)

I'm angry that my parents also encouraged that and that everyone was so PC nobody had the courage to tell me the truth about being a woman, seeking a man, age, men not going to like you for being annoyingly witty and all that.  Edit: I didn't know until *last year* that conception gets harder even though you still have periods.  I was taught it's all good through menopause.  

Not even one woman was a mentor.  They all got divorced.  Well ok my grandma might be a little bit.  Feminist streak but old fashioned about dating.  My mother mocks her about it all the time.  

I'm angry my moms feminist agenda meant she had to hate makeup, shame me for liking boys. 


Honestly I do try to forgive but sometimes I get so angry with society.  I don't think I'm a victim *now* but all of us were lied to and I hate it.  

How can I move forward and let this go?  I feel it every day getting up and wearing smart business clothes with harsh lines and hearing people yell on the phone all day and everyone trying to get ahead, only to come home too tired to even cook for myself so I don't eat dinner.

I blamed nature and the food industry for my weight, men for my insecurities, my work environment for my lack of motivation, people for my anxiety and boring personality, technology for my procrastination, the list went on and on.

- How did I help create the problem?

- How will I help solve the problem?

5v41he,Soft Power,"I wrote a recent post about three of my girlfriends who had felt they ""molded"" their man into the success that he presently is but then their men cheated on them in return. These girlfriends also had domineering aggressive personalities. They frequently fought with their husbands because they felt they weren't getting what they wanted in return.

I remember I had visited one of those girlfriends a few years ago, when I was with my ex-boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend would always be helpful to me - taking my suitcase, opening doors, paying for me, offering his sweater when I was cold. My girlfriend would always be astonished and ask me how she could ""get one of those."" It made me think...

Basically there are two ways to get something out of your man: by demanding he does it for you or by inspiring him to do it for you. Inspiring him is soft power.

**Have no expectations.** Be capable, but if he offers to help you, graciously accept. The common problem is women expect their men to do things for them all the time, so when he doesn't contribute, the women becomes a shrew and nags. For example: My friend is grocery shopping with her boyfriend. After checkout, she looks at him expectantly for him to take the bags. He grumbles and feels resentful. However, if you take the bags yourself, he may or may not offer to help you. I find that most boyfriends do, if they see you doing it yourself. But the key is to have them offer to help you, not to expect (or direct) them to help you.

**Make your boundaries clear and then STFU.** It's high character for a woman to have boundaries. Men also prefer you to have boundaries because they don't actually want to walk all over you - that's reserved for plates. But there's a huge difference in how you set them. For example, let's say you're anti-smoking and your boyfriend smokes, but he knows he should quit. Instead of nagging at him every time he takes out a cigarette and telling him how disgusting it is, tell him you don't like smokers and then STFU. Next time he smokes, don't say anything but make subtle reactions such as waving smoke away from you, or not kissing him if he has cigarette breath. This is soft power. Nagging is not.

**Don't give him a reason to not offer something to you.** This mostly coincides with nagging and resentment. If you're a peaceful serene woman who doesn't give any trouble, it's actually very easy for men to want to help you. If you've emasculated him or controlled him in some way, he doesn't feel tender toward you. This is the easiest soft power, you don't have to do anything!!! I often just sit on the couch watching TV while my boyfriend is working, then he'll offer to take me out. I never ask him. But my girlfriend whines that her boyfriend is boring by staying home then her boyfriend is angry and feels like he has to owe her by taking her out. See the difference?

**Be maternal in your chores but not your actions.** OK, so men want someone who's nurturing, we all know that. But how can we be nurturing without being too motherly? Here's the trick: be maternal in your chores (cooking, laundry,) but don't ACT maternal. This means don't ask him how he feels, don't run to solve his problems, don't hug him like a child, don't organize his daily agenda for him. Most of the time when a man wants a nurturer he really means acceptance, because his mother accepted him. When you start reminding him or controlling him, you've moved from girlfriend to domineering mother. Just take care some basic chores to contribute to the household and let him figure out his life on his own. Making him feel sexy and admired is number one, not wiping his shirt when he has a stain on it.

**Vet, vet, vet.** This may be the most important thing to remember: A truly masculine man is giving and generous. If he was not actively taking the lead when you met and also throughout your courtship, he is not a true masculine man, or at least *not to you.* You **must** hold out for a good match/chemistry if you wish to have a successful relationship. Don't just look at his job, his salary, his physique, his hobbies - look at if he likes making decisions. If he doesn't like making decisions and waffles frequently, guess what, he won't change. And he most likely won't lead. For soft power to work, you need a truly masculine man who likes making decisions. And you should love him for the man he is. He doesn't like going out, but you do? Don't expect him to offer to take you out even if you're being soft and feminine. It's not who he is. Accept him or move on.

5sz8um,"""Society is creating a new crop of alpha women who are unable to love""","&gt;Editor's note: The following column is adapted from the new book ""The Alpha Female’s Guide to Men &amp; Marriage"" Post Hill Press (February 14, 2017).

&gt;Like me, my mother was not a perfect wife. She was, however, a remarkable and compassionate woman. And she was fiercely devoted to my father, so much so that five years after he died, she couldn’t bring herself to even kiss the man who fell in love with her at the independent living facility where she lived for a year and a half before she too passed away. The man wanted to marry her, but it was out of the question. In my mother’s mind, there was only one man for her. That he was gone and she was technically available was beside the point.

&gt;Despite my mother’s allegiance to my father, she never quite mastered wifedom—for one reason: she was wholly unyielding.

&gt;With my mother, everything was a fight. Everything was “No” unless she determined it was appropriate to say yes. If my mother wasn’t the one who made the decision, the decision couldn’t possibly be good. Every so often she would appear to cede to my father’s wishes, but only if she happened to agree with him.

&gt;Indeed, my mother was the quintessential alpha wife. An alpha wife micromanages, delegates and makes most or even all of the decisions. She is, quite simply, the Boss.

&gt;Every relationship requires a masculine and a feminine energy to thrive. If women want to find peace with men, they must find their feminine—that is where their real power lies.

&gt;Alpha women aren’t exactly new, but they were once a rarer breed. Today they abound. There are several reasons why, but it’s in large part due to women having been groomed to be leaders rather than to be wives. Simply put, women have become too much like men. They’re too competitive. Too masculine. Too alpha.

&gt;That may get them ahead at work. But when it comes to love, it will land them in a ditch.

&gt;Every relationship requires a masculine and a feminine energy to thrive. If women want to find peace with men, they must find their feminine—that is where their real power lies. Being feminine isn’t about being beautiful or svelte, or even about wearing high heels (although those things are nice). Being feminine is a state of mind. It’s an attitude.

&gt;In essence, being feminine means being nice. It means being soft instead of hard. And by “nice,” I don’t mean you should become a mouse. (That’s the narrative the culture sells, but that doesn’t make it true.) Men love women who are fun and feisty and who know their own mind! But they don’t want a woman who tells them what to do. As a man named Chuck once wrote on my site: “A strong woman is awesome. But she must be inviting and be able to mesh into an actual relationship. Needing to dominate and overpower, that is a no go.”

&gt;Jackie Kennedy once said there are two kinds of women: those who want power in the world, and those who want power in bed. American women have become laser-focused on the former and have rejected the latter. In doing so, they’ve undermined their ability to find lasting love.

&gt;The roles may have changed, but the rules haven’t. All a good man wants is for his wife to be happy, and he will go to great lengths to make it happen. He’ll even support his wife’s ideas, plans or opinions if he doesn’t agree with them. That’s because a husband’s number one goal is to please his wife. If he determines his wife cannot be pleased, that’s when the marriage is in trouble.

&gt;Men are just so much simpler than women. Not simple as in dumb, as is often portrayed in the media. Simple in that they have far fewer needs than women do. What men want most of all is respect, companionship and sex. If you supply these basics, your husband will do anything for you—slay the dragons, kill the beast, work three jobs, etc. Men will happily do this if, and only if, they are loved well in return. It is when men are not loved well that problems arise. That is the nature of the male-female dance.

&gt;Now I know what you’re thinking: that I’m putting everything on you. I am, and I’m not. Your husband is 100% responsible for his own actions. If he makes stupid choices, such as getting repeatedly drunk, it’s his job to own up to that behavior and stop it. Same goes for his emotional outbursts, if he has them, or his not coming home when he said he would. Or even his having an affair.

&gt;What I am saying is that men tend to follow women’s lead. Your husband’s actions are more often than not reactions. He’s reacting to something you said or did, or to something you didn’t say or didn’t do. He’s reacting to your moods, your gestures, your inflections and your tone. That’s how men are. Your husband wants you to be happy, and when he sees it isn’t working he thinks he’s failed. That’s when he acts out.

&gt;Another way to think about the male-female dance is to consider the game of chess. In chess, the king is the most important piece but also one of the weakest. He can only move one square in any direction—up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The queen, however, is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one direction—forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. And how she moves affects how he moves.

&gt;As a woman, you can respond to this dynamic in one of two ways: you can resent it, or you can embrace it. I used to resent it. I’d think to myself, How can I possibly make sure my husband isn’t negatively affected by my every mood swing? I’m a Pisces, for God’s sake! My moods shift with the wind! Plus, why am I responsible for my husband’s reactions? The whole thing seemed like a whole lot of pressure, not to mention unfair.

&gt;As a result, I embraced my alpha personality as though it were a baby in need of protection. If my husband chose me, obviously he likes that about me. Why should I have to change? Who would I be if I changed? And how could I be someone different, even if I wanted to?

&gt;But my alpha ways were bumping up against his alpha nature. We were like two bulls hanging out in the same pen together, and there was too much friction. And because I had zero interest in my husband adopting a more feminine role, I set about to become the feminine creature our culture insists women not be.

&gt;And here’s what I learned: It’s liberating to be a beta!

&gt;I’m an alpha all day long, and it gets tiresome. I concede that I thrive on it; but at the end of the day, I’m spent. Self-reliance is exhausting. Making all the decisions is exhausting. Driving the car, literally or figuratively, is exhausting.

&gt;It took me a ridiculously long time to get it. But once I did, once I accepted that the energy I exude and the way I approach my husband directly affects his response and behavior, I changed my tune. And when I did, something happened.

&gt;The tension disappeared overnight.

&gt;Just like that.

&gt;Well, almost like that. It was a lot of stop and go at first. First I’d handle something the “right” way—i.e. by not arguing with him, or by not directing his traffic, or by being more service-oriented—and marvel at the response. Then life would get busy, and I’d resort to my old ways. Sure enough, I’d get a different response. So I’d make a mental note of how I messed up and make sure to get it right the next time. Eventually, it became second nature.

&gt;It’s like weight loss. Once you realize that diet and exercise is the only way to stay fit, and that sugar and carbs create fat, a light bulb goes off in your head. You’ve unlocked the code to keeping your weight in check. Even if you fall off the wagon (and you will), you’ll know what to do to get back on track.

&gt;That’s what it’s like to love a man. Once you learn how, you’re good to go. You have all the tools you need.

&gt;But you have to use them.

5st9kx,"""Incredible Women Often Have the Worst Dating Lives"" or Strong Independent Woman Who Don't Need No Man","I came across [this](http://www.bolde.com/incredible-women-often-have-worst-dating-lives-heres-why/) article on my Facebook page, and naturally it reminded me of the relationship dynamics we talk about on this subreddit. It outlines the qualities of ""incredible"" women that make them undateable. Here are a few of the qualities and my translations:

Intimidating (Bitchy): have BRF, make no effort to smile or be pleasant during any interaction. 

Independent and won't sacrifice for anyone (Selfish): can't manage to skip yoga class to accommodate someone else's schedule.

Built in A-hole repellent (Bitch): see above

They Have Real Goals (Shallow Career Woman Who Can't Form Intimate Bonds): Her career takes precedence over everything in her life, including relationships, including you. Be prepared to be neglected and be told you're not worth it.

They call guys on their bullshit (Humourless Bitch): thinks laughter is weakness.

They're super picky because they know their worth (Unrealistic Expectations): wouldn't take Ryan Gosling because he doesn't have a PhD. 

There are a few more on the list, but not all are delusional misinterpretations. This is one of many articles I've seen that takes negative qualities and spins them as absolute positives, all the while insulting the masculinity of all men. And then they wonder why they're single.

5s5i4u,"Sex and intimacy, intimacy and sex.","**""No sex, no love"" - ""No love, no sex"".** 

This is perhaps the most stereotypical stalemate around. Husband and wife sitting back to back on the bed. He says he needs more sex to love, she says she needs more love to have sex. So who's right?

I personally don't care who's right so I won't attempt to answer that question. Why don't I care who's right? **Because it doesn't matter**. It doesn't help the marriage when one of the two are deemed to be right on this issue. What absolutely does matter is the stalemate caused by this vicious cycle that someone needs to break. It is on this that I will focus today, within a marriage as well as dating. Let's begin. 

**What is sex?**

Well, I'll assume that most of us know what sex is. For the purpose of this discussion, I will consider anything sexual within the realm of sex. 

Sex has many levels. Sex in it's ultimate state is fully naked, penetrative, finishing insider her, kind of sex. This is called intercourse. There's non penetrative sex which some like to call outer-course. There's non orgasm sexual gestures, touches and flirtations of all kinds. All this is part and parcel of human sexuality. 

**What is intimacy?**

Intimacy is a deep connection you have with another person. In [a previous post] (https://redd.it/51oknp), I explained the difference between the intimacy of friendship vs sexual intimacy. Just like there are various levels of sexual contact, so too, there are various levels of intimate connections. 

It is the hope and dream of many people to have a sexually and intimately fulfilling relationship with their spouse. The only question is what comes first, the chicken or the egg?

**Men and women - sex and intimacy**

Men and women tend to approach this topic from opposite directions. While it's true that some men may fit better with the description of women that I'm about to describe and some women may fit better with the description of men, the descriptions which I will describe here speak about the majority which are what can be considered masculine and feminine character traits even though masculine women and feminine men do exist. 

In life in general and sex/intimacy in particular, the masculine way is to see a picture first and then focus in on the details. To see the forest first and then the trees etc. The feminine way is to see the details first and build up to the picture, to see the trees first and then realize there's a forest. This often happens within a split second and isn't always noticeable. **Neither approach is right or wrong, they're just different**. 

When it comes to sex and intimacy, this works in the same manner. For a man, it all starts with full on penetrative sex and from there it trickles down into all the smaller details. The more quality/quantity of sexual activity, the more love, kindness, patience, caring and attention to all the little details he will be motivated to engage in. **For a man, sex leads to intimacy**.

**(Of course, I don't speak here about people who have one way relationships. I speak only about relationships where both parties sincerely wish to invest 100%)**

For a woman, it's the opposite. You start with the small gestures and connections and build your way up all the way to the big thing. Many women need an emotional connection to have sex at all, even more women will have difficulties maintaining full sexuality if there is a lack in intimacy. **For a woman, intimacy leads to sex**. 

**How to break/avoid the stalemate in dating and marriage**

Dating first - in dating, the female approach needs to be taken. What do I mean by this? 

When dating a person for the purpose of building a home, a family and a life together, you must establish a certain level of intimacy way **before** you take off your pants. It's utterly crucial to work your way up from the smallest intimate connections all the way up to eventually having sex when your relationship is already solid and you're both firmly committed to one another. This method of starting from the small things and working your way up, is the female way as mentioned above. Doing this the male way would mean sex on the first date and we all know how good that is for a LTR....

In marriage, it's the opposite. Most of the time. When he complains about not enough sex, what he may be really saying is this - ""I really want to be very intimately and deeply connected to you, but I need sex to make that happen"". This may sound ludicrous to many women but it's true nonetheless. Many women will counter with - ""what does that even mean?!?!? You need to have sex to have an emotional connection? I need an emotional connection to be interested in sex!!!"" While this is true from her perspective, it won't help him nor will it change his perspective. Yelling at him or pointing out how wrong his perspective is will only alienate him further. This will likely cause him to withdraw and no one wins. 

Truth remains that he needs frequent and meaningful sex to maintain his deep intimate connection with you. It isn't only about sex. If it was, he would have never married you, he'd have stuck with pump and dump girls. He married you because he needs something more than just sex. He needs intimacy. He obtains intimacy through sex, but the sex is just the first step for him even if it's the last step for you. **He starts at the top and comes down from sex to all the smaller forms of intimacy, she starts at the bottom and ascends up from small intimacy all the way to sex**. 

Within a marriage, each person needs to continuously invest 100%. In this case - he needs to continuously invest in the little connections and she needs to continuously invest in the bigger, sexual connections. It may be just as challenging for him to keep his engagement in the little connections on the up and up as it is for her to keep her sexual connections on the up and up. If you and your SO are never challenged with any of this, good for you. If you are (sometimes) challenged with any of this, read on. 

What happens when life happens and things get out of sync. One day you wake up and he's not happy with the quantity or quality of sex. She counters that she doesn't feel intimately connected. How do you break the stalemate? Contrary to dating where it's crucial to start with the female way, here, in marriage, it's crucial to start with the male way. This means starting with an increase in quantity and quality of sex, thus allowing the intimacy to follow. If done with an open mind and an open heart, **you will succeed!**. Here's why....

* Sex is more quantifiable than intimacy. If you want things to change, the more you can quantify, the better. 

* When you begin with sex, you covered something big. The result will be a big increase in the bigger elements of intimacy even if the smaller elements will take more time. OTOH when you begin with the small elements and work up to sex, it may take a really long time to get anywhere meaningful. This can lead to burnout. 

* Being sexually active often leads to an increase in sexual desire. It's a win win. OTOH investing more in intimacy without the sex can come at an emotional cost. The more he invests (as making the first move to break the cycle), the more he's likely to resent. 

* If she has responsive desire, it's a good idea to allow him to turn her on. Again, it's a win win.  

**Conclusion** 

We try not to be tit for tat in our marriages but there's a point where we will all begin to feel that we're investing a lot and receiving very little in return. This point is toxic. 

A man will feel used when he invests too much emotionally and it's never enough to get her in the mood for sex. 

A woman will feel used if she invests too much in sex and doesn't receive the emotional connection she craves. 

The way to break the vicious cycle is to begin with a higher frequency and quality of sex. Why, is explained above. 

Cheers!

5qjy94,Low SMV and You,"Let me start with an anecdote.

I know someone who is morbidly obese. I don't know what her SMV would *actually* be to men, but they certainly don't give her the time of day. She doesn't register on their radar, and I would guess her SMV is a 3 according to [this diagram](http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pictorialscale.jpg). But regardless of where she is in the 1-3 range, she is solidly in the ""nope"" zone for most men.

Yet, she is happily married in the happiest marriage I have ever seen. She has a husband who is is a good provider while she is (mostly) a SAHM. He is charming, great around the house, a good father and a good leader. He is the type of man you can count on and trust. She loves and respects him, and together they make a pretty good team. It is a naturally red-pill, but neither of them are red-pill-aware.

She was able to get this man, despite being the same size the day she got married. But here's the catch, he is obese too.

When I watch them, both of them are fully invested in their relationship. While *I* don't find either of them physically attractive, they do. Neither of them feel dissatisfied or short changed in their relationship.

I tell this story, not to tell you about what is probable, because it may not be, but to tell you about what is *possible*. I've watched this relationship for a while, wondering if it defied the rules of The Red Pill. But it really doesn't, because while they are about evenly equated in SMV, they are also about equally equated in RMV. They are both realistic people who are not only *satisfied* with their life partner, they are thrilled. She looks at him and see someone she respects and admires, and he looks at her and see someone he cares about.

In The Red Pill, it is important that we do not ignore reality. In reality some people are low SMV, beyond their control. If what is making you less attractive is within your control, you should not take this as permission to not do something about it. But, if you are in the unfortunate set of people who have deformities that are unfixable, do the best with what you have but also be realistic with what you can get. Learn to look beyond someone's look for their value, and remember to have value beyond your looks. Your RMV is under your control, and if you are able to get that high, you will be able to get a relationship with someone with a high RMV. You may not be able to get a relationship with a hot doctor, but you could still be able to get the acne-scarred science teacher. As long as you are able to be positive and see his value, beyond his looks, there are many low SMV men who have great things to offer.

5qi7l6,The Fear of the Wall and Why I'm Sick of Hearing About It,"There has been *way* too much talk of “The Wall” and a ton of misinformation and half formed ideas flying around here from people who haven’t done thorough research or don’t fully understand what it means. That ends today, I hope.


**Definitions and Explanations**


 *The Wall*: A metaphorical term for a physical manifestation of a woman’s gradual or seemingly overnight decline from her sexual peak.

 [The Rational Male](https://therationalmale.com/2012/07/18/the-wall/) defines it as 
&gt; the threshold at which most women realize their lessened capacity to sexually compete with the next generation of women in their ‘actualized’ sexual peak (22-24).

 We all can agree that this is the loose definition most of us use, yes? So if you define your peak as 22-24, it makes sense that many would (wrongly) assume that 25+ is The Wall. Not so. In fact, RM goes on to describe what I believe is a much more important factor in The Wall for women and defines their fear of it: 
&gt; However, there is a male part of the Wall equation that needs to be understood. 30 is also the general age at which men (should) become aware of their own, longer-lasting sexual market value and potential. This affects women’s interpretations of the Wall. Once a Man is aware that he has the capacity to attract the sexual attentions of the younger women he’d previously had limited access and understanding of, his actions and imperatives define the Wall for women who are approaching that threshold.

 [Notes From a Red Pill Girl](https://notesfromaredpillgirl.com/2015/09/08/the-wall-gets-us-all/) explains it well when she says, 
&gt; What is taboo to say in society today (but women should know) is that a woman’s most valuable assets are her beauty and youth, not her education, money, or career (that would be men.) 

**What This Means For You**

 Is there a wall? Yes. Will you hit it? Yes. Should you be aware of it? Yes. Should you obsess or be afraid? *No!* 
If you obsess about The Wall or are afraid of it, you will most likely settle down with the first chump that comes along because you’re afraid you won’t get anything more. Now, recently the argument was made to me that ugly girls have to settle and that marrying for love and passion is a new-fangled thing. Wonderful. Follow your own advice and enjoy your boring and stale marriage, plus the fact that you most likely will be divorced when your chump realizes there’s a woman out there that will love him the way he deserves. I’m aware there are ugly people. This isn’t a post about that. I’m talking today about The Wall. 

 **Things that accelerate your ETA to The Wall**


 * Excessive drinking
 * Smoking of any kind 
 * Being a single mother
 * Being overweight
 * Sun exposure or tanning lights


 I tell you these things not to scare you but to motivate you. Don’t delay in looking for a husband. Don’t settle or marry the first guy that doesn’t repulse you. But look for a man while your SMV is at its peak. This varies woman to woman and your SMV, depending on what a man likes, will vary man to man. However GENERALLY you’re at your highest 22-25. You have the greatest chance of attracting what you consider to be the highest value male when you are also at your highest value. Find out what makes a high value man to you, keep yourself in top condition and go after it. 
 Stay fit, stay healthy, dress feminine, up your girl game, hone your skills. These are all highly controllable things we can all do (pre or post wall) to ensure we land the highest value male available to us. 


**Preparing for Impact**

 Save it. We all know there are exceptions. We all know women who have gotten pregnant in their 40’s (Michelle Duggar, anyone?) or women who are 35 and crazy hot. These are *general* rules which is why I hate to see ladies obsess over The Wall. 

 I want to see you ladies stop saying “I’m about to hit The Wall” when I see from your flairs or your posts that you’re 22, 25, 23, NINETEEN. You never know when or how badly you’ll hit The Wall. If you’ve taken care of yourself, you’ll wake up one day and realize you’re past your prime. If you haven’t, you’ll most likely smash into it and you’ll be the chick everyone is looking at TimeHop photos on Faceboook of and laughing about how good you looked 2 years ago compared to the train wreck of today (Tara Reid, anyone?) 

 
 If you’re married, a fantastic added benefit of your matrimony is that you will no longer fear The Wall. As *Notes From a Red Pill Girl* states,
&gt; Married women who are happily so will benefit from ‘wife goggles’ which is a term that means her husband’s love blinds him to how his wife is aging and he still sees her as in her youth. You want those wife goggles firmly in place prior to the wall.
 
My MIL is 55 and my FIL is so in love with her and smitten by her he’s never even aware of other women around him. She treats him like a king, and he is obsessed with her, five kids and thirty-one years later. 


**Post Wall**

 What if you’ve hit The Wall and you’re still single? There’s still hope for you. You can still find a man, he just won’t be as high a caliber as you could have snagged if you were 20. You aren’t doomed to a life alone or a life of unattractive shlubs and bad sex. You still have worth. I think that is something a lot of women feel is that after The Wall they are worthless. Not true. There are men that don’t want children or who have children from previous marriages and don’t want more. Your fertility won’t matter to them. Maybe it will be an older man. My dad is 59, his girlfriend is twenty years younger than him but is still over The Wall. 


 The Wall is a thing and should be taken seriously but don’t let it rule your life. And for God’s sake, *stop saying you’re about to hit The Wall*. Women my age and older, when we hear you lament about it are literally rolling our eyes and I’m worried mine will fall out of my head the next time I read it. 


 If my post is lacking in a specific aspect or if you have a comment or suggestion to add, please do so below. I like to have my posts be as complete as possible so people reading them are completely informed. Any and all discussions are welcome, obviously, but please lets be mindful and courteous of one another.

5pt40s,The Five Faces of the Perfect Wife,"Recently another user made a post about the duality of being a ""lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets,"" and it got me thinking of the multiple roles we need to play as women when we become wives. Although I am not married, I have been in an LTR for four years, and this is my theory based on my experience. I think the perfect wife can be broken down into five different roles:

**Mother**

**Confidante**

**Waitress**

**Whore***

**Cheerleader**

**The Mother** is the nurturer. She is responsible for raising the children, taking care of hearth and home, healing the sick, and providing comfort.

**The Confidante** is the husband's trusted advisor who provides him counsel and support. The First Mate, there to help envision the bigger picture for the family and steer the ship in that direction. A shoulder for the husband to cry on if needed.

**The Waitress** is the cheerful attendant of the husband's daily needs. She makes the food, keeps the man comfortable, and anticipates his needs. She is cute and upbeat, always ready with a smile. Makes the man feel pampered while still feeling masculine.

**The Whore** is the mistress of her man's sexual needs. Her job is to be sexually willing, open, and adventurous. She needs to make him feel wanted--a god among kings. She also provides other sensual comforts like massages. Helps her husband let go and unleash his inner animal.

**The Cheerleader** is the public face of a husband's support from his wife. She too is cheerful, openly supportive of her husband, and helps improve and maintain his public image. She is considered high value by most, and her approval reflects well on her husband. 

You may notice that many of these categories overlap to a degree. And they should; they are all facets of the same woman. Both the Waitress and the Whore are responsible for tending to her man, bolstering his confidence, and reinforcing his masculinity. Both the Mother and Confidante are serious, supportive roles.

If you're thinking you're not well balanced in all of these areas or that you find yourself lacking in one role, you are not alone. This balance is a constant effort that becomes easier with time and the more you get to know your partner. I said this is the picture of the ""perfect"" wife, and no one in reality is perfect.

Issues arise when women forget some of their roles and favor others too heavily. A very common example is a Mother forgetting her inner Whore. She has children, gains weight, shears off her hair, and dresses in frumpy clothes. Her husband misses out on the sexual fulfillment he needs, and she misses out on the confidence and satisfaction of being the object of her man's desire. 

Another example would be letting the Waitress outshine the Cheerleader. Perhaps a wife excels at anticipating her husband's every whim before he can even imagine it at home, but then at a company dinner party she falls short supporting her husband and actively speaking well of him to his boss and co-workers. 

All of these areas need to be balanced, and which roll is needed when varies from relationship to relationship. We all have all of these women within us!

5pm5az,The most beautiful woman in the world!,"How many girls and woman crave to have that one special man for whom they are the most beautiful woman in the world?

Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Therefore, there isn't such a thing as the most objectively beautiful woman in the world. Nonetheless, many woman wish to be the most beautiful in the eyes of their beholder. A more beautiful woman then themselves can sometimes bring out deep insecurities and fear of abandonment. 

I'd like to attempt to quell some of these fears. 

**Male and female sexual attraction and strategy**

Men and women aren't attracted to the same physical features and character traits. Some times, we are even attracted to opposite things. A very common mistake is to assume that what you're attracted to is what s/he is attracted to and act accordingly, often with disastrous results. Here are a few examples. 

1) Men are attracted to submissive women who will defer to their opinion. Many men offer the same kind of respect to their woman by deferring to whatever she wants. Problem is that she is attracted to a leader and sees his deference as him being incapable of making up his mind. 

2) Women are attracted to a strong leader, a captain of his ship. Many woman offer the same kind of ""strong independent woman leadership"" to their men. The men however see this behavior as bossy and unattractive. 

3) Men are attracted to kindness in a woman. Many men offer their woman an extra dose of kindness. Yes is the default answer to all her requests. This may be a turnoff for her because she may see this as him lacking a backbone. Indeed, a man can be too nice (many men have a very hard time accepting this).

4) Women are attracted to men who set boundaries and lay down the law. Many women offer this to their men, they lay down the law with regards to many areas of life. This may be a turnoff to the men who may find these women to be too stiff and no fun to be around. 

Many more examples can be brought in. The point is that we are often attracted to different or even opposite things. 

The reasons we get together with one another are also different for men and women. Therefore, the motivation to keep working on the relationship will differ as well. Here are some examples.

**Choosing a mate**

Women are the gatekeepers of sex, men are the gatekeepers of commitment. In RP lingo - men have higher RMV while women have higher SMV. This is simple economics of supply and demand. While men and women both want sex and a committed relationship, men want sex more and women want commitment more. This is explained iin my post on [SMV &amp; RMV] (https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5j2g6t/smv_rmv/)

A man is therefore the ""owner"" of commitment and the women is the ""buyer"". A women is the ""owner"" of sex and the man is the ""buyer"". This means that the man has to provide the woman with a good relationship in exchange for sex, while the woman has to provide the man with good sex in exchange for a commitment. Of course, we try to stay as far away from tit for tat behavior as possible, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that no exchange at all transpires here. Just look at the dead bedrooms sub and you'll see how things go when one partner feels like they're putting in way more than they're taking out. Both men and women become miserable when this barter exchange is off kilter. 

Because the man owns the commitment and the woman owns the sex, they will each approach both of these concepts differently. Because their individual needs are different, they will choose differently. 

A woman needs to obtain the guy with the most stability. For this she needs a man who is intelligent and strong. A man who can protect her and make her feel safe and secure both physically and emotionally. **Therefore, the more stability he can provide, the more attractive he is**. If she's with a strong man and she encounters a stronger man, she may be very tempted to branch swing because the new guy is more attractive. (Of course, she can stop herself from doing so). We call this hypergamy. 

A man needs to be sexually fulfilled in quantity as well as quality. For this he needs a woman to whom he's sexually attracted and who has a strong sexual desire for him. He needs someone who is enjoyable to be with in bed and who fulfills his sexual needs. Once he has that woman, **he doesn't need a woman who's more beautiful because being more beautiful doesn't add any value to fulfilling his quantitative and qualitative needs**. 

In other words - a more attractive man is potentially more valuable to a woman. A more attractive woman isn't more valueble to a man unless the only thing of value he's getting from her is sex. 

**Conclusion**

You don't need to be the most beautiful woman in the world because he doesn't think the way you do. It's okay if you're just beautiful in his eyes. He may lie to please you by telling you that you're the most beautiful woman in the world, but is that what you really want?

Of course, how can I end this post without this [awesome video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZsGpWJmos) from Prager University.

5my7xk,I sewed my boyfriend’s jeans,"So I’m not sure this counts as a full field report but I wanted to share this little moment. I started reading and following RPW a few months ago and around the same time moved in with my SO. The ideas surrounding feminine behavior and embracing a feminine role in your relationship really appealed to me and I have been trying to apply them in my life.

The other night I had a lovely epiphany and it may seem a little silly but stay with me! So, my SO finds he has had a hole in his favorite jeans. He looks around a bit for new ones but doesn’t have much luck and we are trying to save money at the moment so he doesn’t want to spend too much  – I love how responsible he is on this front :) I’m sure to many of you ladies this wouldn’t be a big deal but I offered to mend the hole for him. I haven’t stitched in a long time and never in front of him but I remembered how and recently got a little sewing-kit to rebuild this skill. It seemed like a little thing to offer but I could not have predicted how happy he was and how content doing this little act of service for him made me. Now, I am not the world’s best seamstress by any stretch but  as I was sitting beside him on the sofa stitching I just felt this contentment wash over me -  I felt so pleased and proud that I could add this special value to his life and that he so valued me for it. I also felt feminine in completing such a task and empowered by that.


When he tried them on he seemed so amazed and proud and said he couldn’t wait to show everyone at work – we had to laugh because he won’t really be able to show anyone due to the “delicate” location of the hole! But it just showed me how me doing this seemingly small thing – a thing which a few months ago I might not have even offered to do due to a misplaced fear of betraying some sort of principal of “equality” – both made him super happy, me super content and led to an atmosphere of laughter and lightness in our home.  It inspired me to keep working on ways in which I can develop feminine skills which are often underappreciated in mainstream culture but can bring such a lot to homes and relationships. I’d love to hear how you ladies develop and use these in your homes!! Thank you for this sub which inspired this and for reading :)  

5l94vb,"I brought my SO my problem, and he solved it","Just like a lot of guys are on TRP because they're anything but alpha, I'm on RPW because deferring to my SO doesn't come naturally to me. I'm soft and feminine alright, but I also like to have things under control, make sure stuff gets done. I'm the girl who lets her man decide, but then subtly hints that she'd maybe like the other option better.

So this week I had a big problem. SO and I found out that my brother's girlfriend, who's always been a bit unstable, had done something stupid, crazy and possibly criminal. I didn't know what to do. Confronting her, at the risk of her denying it and everything blowing up in my face? Telling my brother, and possibly hurting him very much by it? Just letting it pass, but then afterwards feel guilty if she would do something even crazier? And the holidays didn't make it easier, I didn't want to ruin things for my familiy. So this thing grew bigger and bigger in my head, I tossed and turned, kept doubting how to proceed, asked my SO's advice a hundred times, but then going 'ok, but what if...' and not acting on it.

Yesterday he got sick of it. He said: 'This has cost you enough sleep. Just say the word, and I'll fix it for you. But then I don't want to hear another word from you about it.'

So I deferred, and I found it incredibly difficult, because this wasn't about deciding which restaurant we'd go to, this was about my family. And I have to admit that I doubted him, I was afraid he wouldn't approach it the right way. But I did it anyway. I kept wanting to give him advice but he didn't want to hear it.

When I came home at night, it was handled. He'd had a good talk with my brother over a beer, and then they had the girlfriend come over and confronted her. They already called to apologise and tonight we're going to talk it over, the four of us. 
I feel so incredibly relieved, and love my SO even more because he handled it so calmly, where I had all these scenes in my head about how badly this could go.

 I guess my title's wrong because I didn't bring him my problem, I let him take it from me. I guess it takes these kind of delicate problems to really learn how much you can trust your SO.So yeah, another step in my journey towards being a Surrendered Wife :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5l94vb/i_brought_my_so_my_problem_and_he_solved_it/,1483179877.0,56,0.89,5,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
5knhk9,F. Scott Fitzgerald’s advice to his daughter on what to look for in a man,"Was reading F. Scott Fitzgerald’s letters to his daughter and came across the following piece of advice that some of you may find helpful:

*“You haven’t given me much idea of — . Would he object to your working - outside the house I mean? Excluding personal charm, which I assume, and the more conventional virtues which go with success in business, is he his own man? Has he any force of character? Or imagination and generosity? Does he read books? Has he any leaning toward the arts and sciences or anything beyond creature comfort and duck-shooting? In short, has he the possibilities of growth that would make a lifetime with him seem attractive? These things don’t appear later - they are either there latently or they will never be there at all.”* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5knhk9/f_scott_fitzgeralds_advice_to_his_daughter_on/,1482888806.0,161,0.97,6,RedPillWomen,MarlonBrandoJr
5k4153,Perfect Example of a Shit Test,"The question of ""what's a shit test?"" Is typically always followed by ""can you give an example?"" Well yes, yes I can because I (without even realizing it!) just pulled one on my husband. Here it is:

 In our home my husband's one regular job is to take out the trash. He was getting it all ready to go and when he put a new bag in, as soon something was tossed into it, one side started sliding into the can. I didn't fix it and somehow I got it in my head to ""see if he'll fix it"". 

 The can kept getting more and more full and internally I was shaking my head thinking, ""I can't *believe* he hasn't fixed it yet! Or *noticed* it needs to be fixed!"" 

 DH comes along and finally, the bag has completely disappeared under all the trash and says, ""why isn't there are bag in here?"" 
I said, ""there is, I was just waiting to see how long it took you to notice there was a problem,"" to which he laughed and said ""that's insane. Why am I the only one allowed touch it? If you needed permission you could have just asked."" (He's the king of amused mastery without knowing what it is.) 

 That's the point! Why *didn't* I just fix it? I don't have an answer. I got it in my head that he should do it and never stopped to ask myself why. That's a shit test. Here's why: there was no right answer. If he ignored the bag or didn't notice the problem, he fails because he didn't fix the problem. If he *did* fix the bag, I wouldn't have been happy because it's something he ""should be doing anyway"". There's no right answer for him. 

 Actually the third option, which is to point out how stupid the whole idea was, that's the right answer. I felt so dumb. I didn't even realize I was pulling a shit test. And what for? 

So there it is ladies and gents, a real life example of a shit test. Merry Christmas RPW, I love this community and I'm so grateful for it.

5jopnk,Misconceptions,"So every so often there seems to be an influx of posts and comments that will walk the fine line of bashing TRP. This is happening once again and as a frequent poster and EC, I'm extremely tired of answering the same, unoriginal questions and defending the philosophy. I hope this post clears up questions some of you may have out there. If I missed any, feel free to add in the comments.

 * *The Red Pill hates women, how could women support it?* The Red Pill does not hate women. The Red Pill explains who we are as humans and as specific genders **in general** at our most base instincts. While some of the harsh truths may not be flattering to women, they aren't flattering to men either. If men were perfect there would be no need for TRP because men wouldn't be beta-ing out (read: failing) at life. TRP helps rehabilitate men and women alike, cut through all the crap the feminist agenda has been feeding us our whole lives and reconnect with our natural instincts and purposes. 

 The men on TRP have a phase of anger that they go through when they “swallow the red pill”. Women typically have a guilt phase. We encourage women not to visit TRP because the men working through the anger phase obviously can be abrasive and offensive. They need a space to do that in. Let them be! Not every RP guy is like that, it just seems the norm because of the space you’re visiting; in reality it is a small percentage of the population.

 * *TRP thinks women are below men* 
Men and women are different and have different roles. Neither gender’s role is more important than the other and neither gender is better than the other. Men are just **better** at certain things than women are and women are **better** at certain things than men are. (**IN GENERAL** Obviously there are exceptions to everything!) 

 That doesn’t mean women can’t hold jobs to be truly RPW or we can’t handle the finances or whatever. That actually has nothing to do with anything. It does seem to be somewhat normal that many RPW aspire to be homemakers but I believe that has to do with the fact that RPW aligns with traditional/conservative values/families and not because it is an RPW “rule” itself. 

 No one ever said men were better than women. Yes, again, I’m well aware that there are some less than flattering posts about women on TRP. I’m sure some of the men over there do think they’re better but they’re the exception and not the rule. 

 * *RPW don’t want a RP man** 

 This is another one of those phrases that gets repeated so much it loses its meaning. RPW do not want a guy that is a player. Some of the men at TRP use their RP skills to spin plates, some have decided to never marry, some have decided to just get laid as much as possible. That’s OK! That’s what they have decided to do with their sexual strategy. RPW do not want to do that. Instead we want to vet a long term partner. So when people say “RPW don’t wan a RP man” what they really mean to say is they don’t want the guys who spin plates and sleep around. 
 But just as much as an RPW wouldn’t want an RP guy like that, the RP guy isn’t looking for an RPW - he’s looking for a ONS - something he won’t get from us! I was asked a few days ago how and why I would identify with a network where the men are people I wouldn’t date but that isn’t true. I just wouldn’t date one of *those* RP guys. There are a few regular posters here that give great advice and seem (albeit while just on the internet) like they would be solid relationship material. One of our own mods is a man and *gasp!* RP!!!!! But guess what, he’s admitted to being in relationships before. 
There are plenty of RP men who want relationships. *Those* are the RP men women want to date. 

I believe the part that gets twisted in people’s minds is the “alpha” part. If a guy is too far alpha one way, he will only be looking out for himself and thus would not make a good long term partner. However even this belief is a generalization because there are some men who sit high on the alpha spectrum that are family men. So the simple answer to this particular “rule” and its exception is, vet your men, ladies. 

  * *RPW is all about how to improve for the man but what is the man doing to improve?*

 That’s a great question. RPW can’t answer that for you though. The only person you have control over in this life is you. *You* have the power to change and RPW (or TRP) can help. The idea is that if you change enough for your SO, you *may* inspire change in them by motivating them to be better. Maybe that will work, maybe it won’t. There is always the chance that the guy you’re dating won’t step up and lead or won’t be motivated by your hard work to change or won’t do anything. Guess what? *Leave him*. He’s not captain  material and your SMV/RMW is too high to be wasting your time with someone like that. It’s that simple.

 In conclusion, TRP and RPW work with the same theories but have many different goals and ways of reaching those goals. But that’s ok! You don’t have to use all the strategies and theories in your life. My RPW journey looks much different than any other user’s. That’s OK! We also have different goals in life and different beliefs. 
Not every RPW wants children or is a Christian. I am. That doesn’t mean the strategies haven’t improved our lives. Maybe there’s a guy at TRP who thinks women suck and are only good for sleeping with. That’s OK! I won’t be his friend and I certainly won’t sleep with him but he can do as he pleases. 
There’s also men over there that, as I said before, are in relationships. There’s a vast majority of people and ideas across TRP network. If there’s a particular train of thought, idea, theory or tenant you don’t like or don’t agree with, don’t throw the baby out with the bath water. Just don’t use whatever you don’t agree with. 

 I hope this has cleared up a few popular misconceptions for some users. I expect there to be debate in the comments and possibly even lively debate but can we please all be respectful of each other. You can be direct without being rude. I’ve noticed some people forgetting their manners and being excessively and unnecessarily aggressive lately and I for one have grown weary of it.

5hoqww,Insight from an unexpected place (slightly nsfw),"I work with a man who is 24 and gay. He has been with his boyfriend for 4 years, they live together, have talked about marriage, etc. Today, when I asked my coworker ""Scott"" how his bf ""Jared"" has been, he replied, hesitatingly, that Jared was fine. I gently asked if everything was ok, and he just hesitated, before going on to say that he was seriously thinking about ending the relationship. 

Apparently, among other things, Jared is immature, doesn't mind bumming without a job, and since he doesn't really have any dreams of his own, Scott feels like he is just holding him back from his own dreams. And, to top it off, Scott finally blurted ""it's like I'm fucking my brother."" I paused, to see if he would continue, then asked if there was any passion between them. He said no, that they were roommates; comfortable, but not in the good way.

All the other things Scott was venting about were obviously bad signs, but that quote really struck me. Men don't want to fuck their sisters. They want to fuck someone who burns for them, even after years of familiarity. This isn't news for RP, but I thought it would serve as a good reminder. Don't be his pal, or his roommate, or his sister.

5h5c2q,"Dress for your man, not other women","Hi. I just came across this sub a few days ago. I'm f/22 and got married 2 years ago. My relationship fits almost perfectly with RPW ideas already (I feel lucky regarding this) but I've gotten some good tips from here.

One thing I've realized recently is that I need to dress for my husband, not other women. I should take cues from what he likes, not what my friends or FFA are suggesting.

My husband loves all sorts of things that are ""no-nos"" among other women. He likes it when I wear strong eyeshadow *and* a strong lip sometimes. He likes it when I sometimes wear a bra that is not well fitting according to ABraThatFits (dat butt cleavage). And he sure as hell doesn't give a fuck about designer brands. A feminine purse from Target is as attractive (if not more) to him than a Chanel bag. He likes it when I wear a belt to emphasize my waist even though according to FFA, that's *so* out of style. He *doesn't* like twee things that show up there all the time, like cat bags and such. Most men tend to like classic styles more, especially once you're already married. He *loves* it when I wear leggings as pants. He likes it when I do my nails, but doesn't really give a shit about fancy designs or ~holo~. Red is ideal.

These are just a few examples. Overall, I would say that you should dress in a way that *men* like, not women. Realizing this has really improved our marriage even more. Once I changed to this mindset, he was all over me. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5h5c2q/dress_for_your_man_not_other_women/,1481176917.0,71,0.92,19,RedPillWomen,QuestioningRedF
5ccti4,Taking the red pill is resulting in the LTR of my dreams.,"Hello hello! So I'm newish to RPW and I've been upping my girl game, confidence, and feminine zest for life following a dark stint subscribing to the feminist church in college.

I have posted here previously regarding a  sigma/introverted man I've been seeing for a year now (https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/55p63f/he_has_given_me_a_conditional_offer_to_move_me_to/). Just to recap, I lost his trust/attraction during the tail end of my SJW days and I fell into a depression related to my paranoid world views and lost sight of myself/life goals. Understandably he had little interest in a relationship with me earlier this year and expressed he didn't want to be my boyfriend and was skeptical of me. We still kept in touch/slept together and during this time I did a complete 180 and took the red pill. 

It really wasn't easy and I went through a depression phase. The ""empowerment"" that feminism claimed to offer me turned me into a reactionary, paranoid, and clingy woman. The way I viewed men was not out of respect and understanding, but out of fear. Feminism taught me that ambiguous forces such as the patriarchy and male privilege influenced men consciously and subconsciously. This supposedly leads to toxic expressions of masculinity, which can manifest in all sorts of ways. Long story short, I was seeing malicious intentions in the men around me that just were not there. While I never had a combative personality, I was needlessly avoidant of men and vetting them incorrectly.

I'm in such a great position today and I owe much of it to finding my inner grace as a woman and respecting the contrasting imperatives/goals that men have. With my (now) boyfriend in particular, it was just a matter of allowing myself to fall in his frame and adding worth to his life outside sex.

You guys weighed in on the situation and I'm happy to say that I've earned a chance with the man of my dreams. Upon him offering conditional LTR/girlfriend status based on my own self improvement, I was confused about if it was a good idea to continue seeing this guy, but things seem to be heading in the right direction since I've decided to continue giving the relationship a shot.

He recently brought me to his brother's fiance's bridal shower, which was a great opportunity for me to make a good impression with the other ladies in his family and meet family members and family friends. He told me it was a rare occurrence that his whole family got together like that, so I felt really special that he trusted me to represent him in that situation. His aunt told him that I was really sweet and he seemed pleased by my manners around his family. I might be spending Christmas with his family now. Yay!

I only get to see him once a week or so since he goes to college an hour away from me, but I really try to make his visits worth it. I've been dolling up in dresses when I see him (he always comments that I look cute!), give him massages,  let him relax after a hard week, giggle with him, buy him his favorite snacks, talk about our shared hobby (trading card games) etc. All those little things add up!

I'm having the best sex of my life. Last time he visited we went at it three times in one night. He really opened up to me during sex. He wanted to look deep into my eyes and talk to me. I told him I wanted to be good to him so much and I didn't want any other guy to touch me or have me. I told him he's the man in my heart. He said ""I know. You are so good to me. That's why I want to have sex with only you. I love you more than anyone. I hope you can feel that.""

He then told me that he loves our sex and that it means something. He told me I am special and when I told him I wanted to be with him he said I was with him. God it was so hot and afterwards he held me tight in his arms and whispered in my ear that he loves me and we fell asleep sweaty and happy. This is some top tier mythic romance novel level stuff. I've been swooning for days.

He's been sending me more ""I miss you"" texts. I just let him initiate conversation and give him space when he needs to focus on school. He has another semester left after this one before he is ejected into the ""real world"" and starts the amazing IT job he's been offered. No more stage five clinger behaviour! Of course having a job and a couple of new projects in my life helps keep me occupied and content. I've been helping a coworker out with her vintage clothing shop on Etsy and I've been taking a introductory web design class and kicking butt at that. Of course I'm watching my calorie intake and doing leg lifts/crunches. I'm already at a healthy weight, but I'm looking to tone the booty and legs.

My end goal is probably what most of you want. I want to make a home with a life partner. Marriage would probably be a part of that. I can definitely see myself with my boyfriend for life and I feel like I'd be the happiest girl alive to stand by him every day. I hope to continue on being a phenomenal girlfriend and respect myself as well.

5ccrux,Welcome to RedPillWomen! Portal for those who found TRP and the other male subs first.,"### Welcome to RedPillWomen!  

We're glad you made it here.  Many women who stumble upon the Men's subs first are shocked by the locker room atmosphere, and flee Red Pill theory entirely, or arrive at our door shell-shocked.  You are in the right place now, and will find a welcoming community.

**Womens' sexual strategy is different from that of men.**

The RedPillWomen subreddit follows the same praxeology of male-female sexual dynamics as TRP.  However, the *application* of sexual strategies is different.  Red Pill Women seek **commitment** from men, and Captains or strong, competent leaders as partners.  This follows the basic sexual marketplace transaction:  Women are the gatekeepers of sex, while men are the gatekeepers of commitment.  

**The sexual strategies of men are not oppositional, but complementary.**  Red Pill Women are not *against* men, but both parties seek to maximize and  fully negotiate their position in sexual and relationship market transactions.  

**RedPillWomen concern themselves with *relationships,* not casual sex.**  Unlike the experience of men, casual sex is so easy for women to obtain that *it requires no strategy.*   The Red Pill calls women in this position *Plates,* and is off-topic and against the rules of this sub accordingly.  

**Stay out of the Men's subs until you've developed a good RP knowledge base from the female perspective.**  Because it's a male space and locker room environment, there exists a certain amount of venting anger and frustration over women.  Only after you're familiar with RP theory does it become easy to recognize the kernels of RP wisdom that are relevant to you.   Experienced RPW members tend to lose curiosity toward the male oriented content anyway.

**Men who came through the women's portal despite being notified:**  It's OK to lurk and read if you want.  However, just as the male spaces have the ""Tits or GTFO"" rule, this is a female space and our policy is [commitment or GTFO.](http://a.trp.red/2v)   Best to go back to the male spaces to post.

### The Red Pill is a male space that can feel harsh for women new to Red Pill concepts.  Now that you've found RedPillWomen, forget the shocking impression this may have left until you learn RP theory from OUR perspective.  

Go ahead and set your flair and join in the discussion!  We're happy to have you.

5ag6ze,15 Things Men Want From Women...IMHO,"Someone asked me to do this for PPD, but I thought it would be interesting to post it here and get a female perspective. I don't know how many of you look at PPD, probably the bickering can get quite tiresome!

So it would be really interesting to know:

(a) if you agree or disagree with any of the 15 points raised;

(b) if you can think of anything on the list that I haven't included.

Oh, I've never posted here, so if I break any of the rules, please feel free to tell me off! I did read the FAQ!

**1. Treat him with respect**

I wrote a post about this previously, but the scenario of what I call ['The Hapless Male and The Competent Female'](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/3ulvsr/the_hapless_male_the_competent_female/) has become such a cultural cliché. Particularly in advertising, men are so often depicted as being buffoons. Which is a little harsh considering, as RP rightly points out, men do virtually all of the dangerous jobs. Would I choose to work on a building site, be a scaffolder, or get shot at in a war (leaving aside my criticisms of foreign policy for the sake of argument)? No, I would not! It's completely unreasonable to expect men to do this, and then laugh at them for being pathetic and belittle their interests and desires.

Yet this happens all the time. It's almost become a way for women to bond; let's all get together and bash our husbands! It's quite telling, and I believe an excellent rule, that you ban this on RPW. I would like to see the same on RP itself, I'd like to see less misogyny, less women bashing, and more positivity. But I digress...

When I think back to my mum and dad's relationship, my mum didn't treat him with sufficient respect and emasculated him. Perhaps this was partly because he was a rubbish husband and didn't deliver what women want from a relationship, whereas her current husband does. But my dad was a pretty special person. He was on the books of both professional cricket and football clubs. He got a double-first from one of England's top universities. He was the head of an English department, and a very esteemed teacher. Everything I am and everything I've achieved comes from him really, my values come from my mum.

So anyway...I've waffled on about that too much, but treat your man with basic respect. This is a really important one for me because I expect to be respected. It is not a good idea to disrespect me. If you treat me with respect, I will do everything I can to please you and make you happy.

**2. Have your own interests**

This is one of the most critical differences between a good guy and a bad guy. A good guy will encourage you to pursue your passions, encourage you to have a busy social life and see your friends and family a lot, and be proud of your every achievement. A bad guy will discourage you, or attempt to dissuade you. Always follow your own interests and passions, and always stay away from bad guys.

**3. Listen to him**

It's often said that men don't listen to women. And there's a lot of truth in this. But equally, I believe that women don't listen to men, possibly even more so. Communication should be a two-way street. And this ties into the next item on the list, which I believe is of critical importance.

**4. Find out what is important to him and try to take an interest in it, even if it's not really your thing**

I'm making my mum sound like a terrible person here, which couldn't be further from the truth because she's a wonderful person. But...she did something once that really bugged me, that sums this one up.

I was playing chess on the Internet, and I was never serious about playing chess, but I used to play quite a bit. And she started saying to me as I was playing (and thus distracting me as well) “don't you get bored playing chess all the time?”.

Yeah, I do, mum. That's why I play chess. I just play it so that I can bore myself. I actually hate the game, I'm just masochistic like that.

A common problem in relationships is that both parties fail to take the interests of the other seriously. It means so much if a woman takes the time to understand what matters to you, what you're passionate about, and values it, praises you for it, and takes an interest in it. I'm a writer, and it means a lot to me when a woman tells me that she respects what I've done in my career. I think all guys feel this way.

Let me give you an example. Check this video out:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkNnv_WgFh4

This guy's wife lets him have a room in the house for his preposterously large retro video games collection. What a fucking woman! That is an extreme example, but that's what I call respecting someone else's interests.

**5. Dress up**

Quite simple...dress up sexy sometimes, without being prompted to do so. Both in private and in public. Doesn't really need any further explanation.

**6. Do something specifically for him from time to time**

It could be cooking a favourite meal, it could be, as I suggested above, dressing a certain way, it could be buying him something, it could be getting him tickets for an event...just show that you're thinking about him and care about him. Again, this is far more valuable when it's personalised. I remember my friend's girlfriend buying my friend a rare Sonic Youth album because she knew he really liked them and could never find it, and he appreciated that so much.

**7. Recognise when he's stressed and tired**

There is a story here that illustrates points 4, 5 and 6. When I was dating a woman some years ago, I had to go away working somewhere, and then I had a long train journey and didn't get back until late on Friday evening. When I got in and walked through the door, she was waiting for me, and she was dressed as a bunny girl. And she was in a really flirtatious mood all evening, and she called me Mr. Browning all evening (well, she actually called me my real name) and she cooked for me and looked after me, and it was the most thoughtful and sexiest thing that anyone has ever done for me. She got plenty in return, trust me.

I found this video that underlines this theme:

http://www.sexyandfunny.com/watch_video/amateur-aniston-shows-her-cooking-skills-and-ass-in-the-kitchen_79964.html

I have seen my mum's husband's daughter with her husband, and she is so bloody unreasonable. I've seen more equal relationships on a cotton plantation in Alabama before slavery was banned! He works his balls off, and all she does is set him new tasks to do. Of course, it is partly his fault for being supplicating and going along with it. But try to be reasonable and don't be a slave driver!

**8. Share some interests**

I like being with a woman who is different from me, as it's nice to learn from your partner and embrace things that you wouldn't otherwise. But, ideally, you should have some interests that you can share. If these don't come along easily, both parties should be responsible for trying to think of activities that can be done together.

**9. Closeness and intimacy**

Men are all about pussy and fucking and orgasms, and we don't enjoy all those girly things like closeness and intimacy, right? Wrong. There is nothing I love more than to hold a woman. I love spooning in particular. I love to hold someone close to me. I love kissing. This is of absolutely essential importance to me in a sustained relationship. I'm sure most guys would agree with that.

**10. Flirt with him**

Just because we've attracted you, fucked you numerous times, and fathered children with you, it doesn't mean that we want you to stop flirting with us. We go through fucking hell in some cases to find a woman who finds us sexy. We never tire of being flirted with, or being made to feel sexy and masculine. So don't stop doing it. Ever.

**11. Make an effort in bed**

Some men are shit in bed. However, most men absolutely want to please their partners, and we love it when you orgasm. Don't be all about yourself, though, give something back. That doesn't mean do things that you don't want to do, but it means that his pleasure should be as importance as yours.

And I would add to that, tell him that it was good (or if it wasn't good, try to give him pointers). I remember one girl I slept with when I was much younger, it was a weird thing, but I could just make her cum so easily. We had a real chemistry, it was weird. But I remember one time I was with her, after we'd finished she looked in my eyes and said “well...that was a bloody good shag”. That means a lot.

**12. Initiate sex occasionally**

A savvy guy knows it is his responsibility to initiate sex. But we honestly don't mind you doing it sometimes! We like to feel that you desire us too! Don't be scared to initiate sex, even if it's only 10% of the time that you actually have sex. This will be appreciated.

**13. Don't make him play unreasonable guessing games**

There is a joke in The Simpsons about this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QQDnnR0V-c

&gt;When a woman says nothing's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. And when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off!

I understand that men have to use social intuition in order to understand women and satisfy them, but acting like a bitch over some perceived misdemeanour, slight or failing is not reasonable behaviour. If he's done something wrong, there really is little or no excuse for not simply telling him what's wrong, instead of expecting him to guess and creating a horrible atmosphere for no good reason.

**14. Keep yourself in shape**

Pretty straightforward, take pride in your appearance and don't let yourself go. This should apply to both parties.

**15. Always be yourself**

Whenever I've seen Cosmopolitan or other similar women's magazines, there is always some bullshit article in there about how you have to act to keep your man, or some other such shite. 

Women don't have to do anything to make us like you. We already like you. You have no idea how much we like you. Thank God that you will never truly understand this! 

If we're with you, it means that we like you. You don't have to change your personality, character, or significantly alter your behaviour, except for showing some basic consideration. Again, this would be another be another red flag of a bad guy; he will try to fundamentally change you. A good guy will always cherish you for who you are, if you treat him with respect.

Always be true to yourself. Always be yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5ag6ze/15_things_men_want_from_womenimho/,1477960888.0,95,0.95,32,RedPillWomen,wub1234
59nwl4,"If you are not official, you are not exclusive!","A common topic or theme I keep seeing when women come to ask RPW for advice is:  

1) asking if the man they are dating is being exclusive with them or   
2) assuming that, even though they're not ""official"", they are exclusive just because he said so  

Newsflash: if these apply to you, you are not exclusive!

**How to tell if you are officially in an LTR:**  

**1) He makes it clear to you (actually says you are boyfriend and girlfriend/in an LTR and *uses those terms*)**  
**2) He makes it public (to his friends, to his family, on social media, etc. i.e. you are not his ""dirty little secret"")**  
**3) He treats the relationship like an actual LTR (i.e. no plate-spinning, etc.)**  

Yes, it's true that even if you are ""official"" there is no guarantee that an ""official"" status will prevent him from spinning plates. However, if you've been following the tenets of RPW, you have [vetted](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4yrsdz/vetting_a_man_part_1_seeker_vet_thyself_first/), [vetted](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4yrqed/vetting_a_man_part_2_observational_and_verbal/), [vetted](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4yrobj/vetting_a_man_part_3_alpha_and_beta_traits/) your man against this tendency and others you do not like, as well as keeping yourself feminine, attractive, etc., enough to keep his attention from wandering.

If you've been hung up on a man that is stringing you along regarding whether you are ""official"" or not, cut contact ASAP. Make your expectations known. [You should probably get tested for STDs too: if he's not open with you about your relationship status and shows signs of plate-spinning behavior, then it's probably best not to make any positive assumptions about the state of his sexual health either.](http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2015/std-surveillance-report-press-release.html)

**TL;DR: Don't be naive. Always assume you are not exclusive until his behavior actually shows otherwise.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/59nwl4/if_you_are_not_official_you_are_not_exclusive/,1477574246.0,55,0.96,29,RedPillWomen,bittersweettruth_

5991x7,10 Surprisingly Common Reasons Men Initiate Divorce,"I think the biggest relationship problems caused by women, today, have not gone unnoticed in the RPW community. Not only does society blame men for EVERYTHING, but we also focus far too little on STAYING married. I 

I thought this Woman's Day article - http://www.womansday.com/relationships/dating-marriage/advice/a7164/reasons-for-divorce/ - offered some great insight into why MEN file for divorce, though women are statistically the initiators. In particular, I liked number 4. I am constantly seeing ""husband are like children, har, har, har"" memes in my newsfeed, but not once have I seen the reverse. Perhaps if more women cared about the viewpoint of the men, these things wouldn't be such a problem, though. 

Excerpt:

As you'd expect, ""She cheated!"" is one big reason guys take the speed ramp to Splitsville. But every year, faithful women get blindsided by divorce papers. What gives? We asked relationship experts about the other grievances once-happy husbands cite for divorcing—their unexpected answers give clues on how to keep your marriage solid.

1. You've let yourself go. 
Men understand that women change over time. But there's a difference between putting on weight and getting so big that the Discovery Channel would be intrigued if you washed up on a beach. And is your car the only thing you wax? ""I have one client whose partner has a chin hair that bothers him so much,"" says Sherry Amatenstein, who specializes in couples' therapy in Long Island City, NY. ""If you don't care enough to look good for your guy, he wonders if you care about him."" Wouldn't you wonder the same if he gave up on his appearance? So banish the granny panties, grey roots and other frumpy fixins'—you'll both feel better.

2. You always say no. 
If you're speaking in negatives as often as a two-year-old does, ""you become a killjoy,"" says Amatenstein. ""It makes you seem more like his mother—not someone he can have fun with, or, if you do it often enough, wants to be around."" Even if you're naysaying for your guy's own good, try to compromise: Maybe he can have a Harley if he promises to always wear a helmet. Hear his wants and your marriage may go the distance.

3. He's more nagged than nurtured. 
""If you dig into your husband for every little screw-up or letdown, he'll feel resentful and eventually shut down,"" says Chicago divorce lawyer Corri Fetman. ""Once this happens, good luck getting your husband to voluntarily put forth effort into anything again—including your marriage!"" Ditch the fuming, and try some finessing. For instance, is your guy always running late? Set your clocks a few minutes ahead. It's sneaky, but less destructive than getting on his case.

4. He feels disrespected. 
Don't follow the husband-bashing humor trend, urges couples' therapist Rosalind Sedacca of West Palm Beach, FL. Resist joking on Facebook about how your favorite basketball fan can't even dribble—and don't rib him in front of friends either. ""Your husband will feel belittled,"" Sedacca warns. ""Confidence and security form the foundation of any marriage,"" she adds. Eventually your man's self-esteem will erode and he'll lose his connection to you. ""Meanwhile, there may be other women who are willing to treat him with admiration,"" Sedacca adds. See where this one's going? Nowhere good!

5. He doesn't have a marriage mentor. 
If your husband's pals make Charlie Sheen look like a choir boy, he needs some buddies who'll raise the bar, says relationship coach and minister Don Nations, of Sarasota, FL. ""If more men had a friend with a solid marriage to whom they could talk, someone who could listen and offer counsel, they'd be less likely to seek a divorce,"" he explains. Your house of worship can fill the void: ""Many offer marriage workshops and discussion groups,"" Nations says. Or pursue friendships with other happy couples—their dedication may inspire you both.

6. You aren't his financial partner. 
If you two can't get on the same page about what to do with your money, it can cause a marriage meltdown, Amatenstein says, ""because of the behaviors it leads to, like engaging in power struggles and keeping secrets, like big purchases, from each other."" The remedy? Sit together and make up a list of dreams you can both agree on, whether it's to retire early or travel more, so you're working toward shared goals. If you really can't find common ground, speak to a financial advisor.

7. You never let him feel like he's Superman. 
""Men stay in a marriage as long as they feel it's possible to be their spouse's salvation,"" says Tracy Thomas, PhD, a licensed psychologist and relationship coach in San Francisco. Praise your husband when opportunities arise, but don't say ""good job,"" Thomas adds. ""It's demeaning, as if he's a little boy."" Instead, be specific—for example, tell him, ""When you call me during the day, it makes me so happy to hear your voice,"" or ""When you shovel the snow for us, it makes me feel so cared for!"" Appreciating his everyday heroism can help you through marriage's rough spots.

8. You disagree about how to raise your children. 
Maybe he's a softie who buys the kids treats, while you fear they'll never learn the value of money. Perhaps he believes in curfews, but you favor free-range kids. ""Get on the same page as much as you can, so you don't undermine or resent each other,"" Amatenstein says. Hammer our mutually acceptable policies about bedtimes, homework and consequences for misbehavior. And before you veto his viewpoint, see where he's coming from (maybe he grew up in a dicey neighborhood, so being home by sunset was a way to stay safe). Give in sometimes, as long as his way won't hurt anyone—""he'll feel that his opinions and feelings matter to you,"" says Amatenstein. And that's crucial for any relationship.

9. He feels neglected. 
Life pulls you in different directions, sure. But ""focusing all your time and energy on your kids or career, and not at all on your husband, emasculates him and makes him feel as interesting as old furniture,"" cautions Fetman. Carve out a few minutes daily to talk to, listen to and laugh only with him. The best time? ""When your guy is most likely to open up, whether it's while relaxing on the couch with a beer, or during pillow talk at bedtime,"" Fetman recommends. ""Try talking about things that have nothing to do with the kids, schedules or anything stressful. Make it fun.""

10. Blended-family drama. 
If his children from a previous relationship don't like you, your own couplehood is in danger. ""He understandably may feel intense loyalty to his kids—after all, partners may come and go but children are forever,"" Amatenstein points out. Make it clear to your husband that you'd love to be a part of the kids' lives, and that no matter what, you know he loves and needs to see them. Don't try to take their mother's place—and never, ever badmouth her in front of them. Ask your hubby for his help in portraying you to the children in the best possible light. With time and a little luck, they'll soon see you're someone worth knowing, respecting and maybe even eventually loving.


So, do you feel like these problems are common in our mainstream feminist society? What would you add?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/5991x7/10_surprisingly_common_reasons_men_initiate/,1477367251.0,57,0.96,17,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
58ow5i,Tips for the Hypergamous Woman,"written by me, primarily for me, but thought you ladies might be interested.

If you're anything like me, sometimes even the best of captains won't be able to keep you from noticing shiny new men in your life. This isn't completely your fault.  Studies show that both men and women employ two main mating strategies, those being monogamous and promiscuous, or restricted and unrestricted, as explained here in this handy wiki on sociosexual orientation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociosexual_orientation. This means that women  on the end of the unrestricted spectrum are more likely to continuously seek out multiple partners in order to have the chance of reproducing with the best mate. Women like this see benefits in short-term mating. If you're a woman towards this end of the spectrum, then you're naturally hypergamous.

Furthermore, over time, it is natural for women's sexual desire to decrease in an LTR, as demonstrated here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-pleasure/201204/does-desire-really-decrease-length-relationship

Does this mean that it's impossible for naturally hypergamous women to have happy, healthy committed relationships with their captains? Of course not! You have free will. It will just be a little more work to fight your natural mating instincts than for women not so evolutionarily inclined to the carousel. Here are some tips on stopping the hypergamous instincts from jump-starting your hamster, and jeopardizing your long-term happiness.

1. Cut yourself a little slack:  If you're a RPW you've been cultivating a more feminine persona both physically and socially, and your growth probably hasn't gone unnoticed. It's OKAY to feel a confidence boost when you notice high-value men noticing you. You've worked for it.

2. Like all good things, slack is best in moderation. While it is acceptable to appreciate this confidence boost, it is NOT OKAY to be actively seeking validation from men other than your captain to give you that confidence boost. There's a fine line between an inner smile, and an errant daydream when you sense someone flirting with you, and engaging them, giving out signals that you are available, and escalating the interaction. You know yourself and your tendencies. You know the difference. Do not lie to yourself.

3. Stop the hamster, before it starts. The way to stop the hamster is to appreciate your Captain when you feel your roaming eye act up. As a RPW you probably had good reasons to choose your captain. He's been vetted for traits you admire and that make you happy. What are these traits? List them to yourself and consider if they're worth losing over the temporary tingles you get from a superficial interaction.

4. Are the pastures really greener on the other side, or are you just not watering the lawn? A happy relationship takes the work of two, but you're only in control of yourself. If things aren't so great lately, ask yourself how are you contributing to the relationship to help your captain lead? Think of actions that would make your captain happy, not solipsistic actions that would satisfy you because you're not dating you! Consider ways that you can be generous towards his desires (I highly recommend The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands by Laura Schlessinger. It's a bit simplistic and overly-religious, but it boils down to core issues for keeping a happy home.) This way your captain can easily take the lead and continuously provide you the tingles you seek from other men.

5. How would you feel if the tables were turned? Don't let the hamster run amok and try to justify flirting with other men. Imagine if your captain was the one being flirted with by other women. If you're like me, you'd be somewhat proud that other women notice him, as it corroborates his high-value, but very grateful that he stays loyal to you. And if he doesn't? If he engages these women in flirtatious behavior and escalates his involvement with them, how would you feel? Would you feel disrespected, and even betrayed? If so, why would you inflict those emotions upon a captain you chose and profess to care about? You're better than this. Don't forget that. That's what brought you to RPW, and what keeps you here.

6. Non-negotiable signs that it really isn't you, it's your captain. There are a few instances in which you really can do better for yourself than your current captain. These include if your captain is cruel, has addictions, cheats, is entirely unambitious and unmotivated to any form of self growth, (this is not strictly financial,) is uncommitted to a future with you, or disagrees with your future thoughts on having a family. If any of these apply to your relationship, the answer is still not flirting with other men while you're committed. What you need to do is grow some ovaries, cut your losses, take what's left of your SMV and RMV, possibly nun mode until you've healed, and then put yourself back on the market. (I highly recommend an interval of nun moding, because as insensitive as it may sound, baggage isn't cute. The type of man you're looking for wants to be your captain, not your bellboy. It's good to make sure your hurt emotions from your past relationship are firmly in storage before you proceed to vet a new captain.) This way you can find a new captain who both gives you tingles and meets your requirements for a mate. 

In closing, what differentiates us from animals is that as humans we have the ability to outsmart nature and bend it to our will. As a conscious and conscientous woman you have the power to be better than your instincts.  While your thoughts may occasionally betray you, your choices define your character. Choose to be a good woman. I'm rooting for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/58ow5i/tips_for_the_hypergamous_woman/,1477075693.0,70,0.94,5,RedPillWomen,electrokiwi

51oknp,The great myth of male-female friendship.,"Hello all, I hope everyone is having a great day today. Today I will write about an issue that keeps coming up on this sub as well as many others, an issue that causes many issues in life - male-female friendships. 

**I firmly believe that it's unnatural for men and women to be ""just friends"", that overcoming this nature is nearly impossible. I think that much heartache can be spared by understanding these truths**

Friendship is a form of intimacy. Sexual bonding is a very different form of intimacy, the polar opposite to friendship. 

**Sexual intimacy** is the union of opposites. Men and women are worlds apart. Men and women - generally speaking - think, speak and behave completely differently. What may be interesting or exciting to one gender is weird or boring to the other gender. Naturally, we need a way to bring these opposites together for the continuation of our species. 

When an eligible man and woman come into the presence of one another, they instinctively act differently. Even if they're just two people sitting next to each other on the train, two people who don't say a word to one another, their body language will change in the presence of a suitor from the opposite sex. This is even more true if they do interact. An inter-gender interaction will be very different from a same gender interaction even when no sexual innuendo is present.

When a man and a woman go out on a date: they'll each dress up, scent up and be on their best behavior. In order to bring these two opposites together, **each one must display the very best version of themselves**. 

**Friendship** OTOH, is the exact opposite. A group of guy friends hanging out may use colourful language, dirty jokes, burp, fart, punch each other for the heck of it and get into wrestling matches. A group of girl friends may squish 15 girls on a couch meant for 3, squeal and screech, talk for hours on end, bawl their eyes out over I'm not sure what, break into giggling fits and plenty of gossip. **In friendship, you're safe to display your very worst**. 

Both of these forms of intimacy are very necessary. 

Men don't talk nearly as much as women do. Even when we talk, it's different, especially when it comes to emotions. Women like to talk things out, men like to fix things. Women like to feel the feelings, men like to resolve them. We each view the other as weird. [This youtube video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg) demonstrates this point beautifully. 

With friends we're free to display the worst version of ourselves, but with our sexual partners it is likely to kill attraction. A guy who displays his insecurities or a girl who bawls her eyes out will have a harder time being attractive to their mates. (Of course there are many examples). 

When you're married, you get the whole package. The morning breath, the mood swings, the insecurities etc. However, we all know that minimising exposure to this side of ourselves is always a good idea. Sure, we need not feel self conscious about our morning breath, but we also need to brush our teeth at the earliest possible time to minimise our spouses exposure to our morning breath. **In sexual intimacy we need to display as much of our best selves and as little of our worst selves as possible.** 

A beta man is unattractive to a woman. To her, the guy is almost like a woman himself with all his feminine behavior.... Therefore, in her mind, he can be ""just a friend"" like all of her other friends from whom she'll seek emotional validation and other girly friend stuff. However, to the guy, he feels that he has a greater chance of getting into her pants or into a relationship with her if he'll be her friend first. He assumes that if he's there for her during all her emotional mood swings, seeing her during her absolute worst and being there for her through these times that she'll find him attractive. Oh the let down when he realizes that this will never happen.....

We all know that this guy is unattractive. We call him a beta orbitor. What isn't talked about enough is the dynamic behind this. She thinks he's just a friend because he's acting feminine like her girl friends while he thinks he's building sexual attraction by being soft and feminine because that's what he finds attractive! It's a recipe for disaster and plenty of heartache. The flip-side of this dynamic is that male-female friendship is nearly impossible. 

Here's [another youtube video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_lh5fR4DMA) demonstrating how men realize that we can't be just friends while women think that ""just friends"" is possible. 

Before I conclude, I need to clarify a point. The difference between friends and friendly. Everything I said in this post is about being friends. It goes without saying that men and women can and should be friendly to one another and to treat each other with respect and dignity. Being friendly isn't the same as being friends. I'm sure most of you know this differentiation, but I'm putting it out there because there's always someone who would pick on something like this.

4zkeck,[FR] Actually trusting your man means not checking up on him.,"Hello ladies of RPW,


I’ve mostly been a lurker on reddit in general but on here as well for the past while. I thought today I would share a post as I’ve been really focusing on making improvements in myself following RPW philosophy. Very thankful I’ve found this subreddit! Since I’ve started incorporating the tenets of RPW into my life I’ve noticed my relationship with my boyfriend growing by leaps and bounds. We’ve been together about five years and I’ve never felt more secure and in-love. I can’t speak for him although I have noticed he seems much less stressed these days! He’s a lawyer so his job is naturally high stress…. I think it’s made a difference that he’s had a lovely and calm home to come home to instead of nagging, manipulation or shrewish behavior. 


Anyway, on to the situation that occurred that lead me to write my first ever post in RPW (and on reddit in general, I suppose?) Apologies if I make any errors, please feel free to let me know if there’s any way I can improve.


This past weekend one of our close friends was having their birthday. My boyfriend mentioned that he would like to throw her a surprise party as her husband just recently had a bit of a health scare and it’s been a tough time for both of them. I love planning parties so of course I jumped at the chance and invited all of our closest friends (mostly couples). 


One of the couples that came, the boyfriend is very close to my boyfriend (we’ll call him K) and has been with his girlfriend (we’ll call her A) for about nine years. A can be a lovely person, her and I get along very well… when she’s sober. Unfortunately she’s quite prone to imbibing too much and there’s been multiple situations where she’s gotten completely wasted. 


We chatted for a while as I put the finishing touches on the appies. She seemed in good spirits although she did make multiple complaints about her body and her appearance which was very sad for me to hear as she’s struggled with her body image for quite some time. 


People steadily started showing up and one of my boyfriend’s buddies brought with him a beer pong set. My boyfriend loves playing games so him and his buddies played. At one point, my boyfriend was eager for me to play a round so the birthday girl and I played against my boyfriend and her husband. They let us use the sangria I made instead of beer since we’re not big drinkers and I had made the sangria very low in alcohol content for that exact purpose. It was super fun! We left them to their shenanigans once our game was over and myself and the other ladies headed out onto the patio to chat and sip on sangria. 


A at this point had been knocking back drinks pretty rapidly and she was starting to get visibly drunk and somewhat belligerent. She mocked me and the birthday girl for playing beer pong with sangria and when the birthday girl laughed and shrugged that seemed to tick her off even more. She called us “p*ssies” and told us she’d “show [us] how it's done”. I laughed, thinking she was kidding, and went back to the conversation I was having with another girl. Next thing I know I hear the patio door open and close and she’s gone inside.


Ten minutes later my boyfriend’s cousin comes outside and looks mortified. She says that A is making an absolute spectacle of herself playing beer pong against my boyfriend, it had gotten so bad she couldn’t even watch she was so embarrassed for her. She tells me apparently she’s shaking her breasts at my boyfriend trying to distract him while he takes a shot and she’s twerking in the mirror and that she called K a homophobic slur in front of everyone. I’m stunned and my first urge is to run inside and see what’s going on, for some reason the hamster in my head starts getting angry at my boyfriend?!


I took a moment to calm myself down, debated pretending to go inside to grab a bite to eat (even though I’d already eaten, I clearly just wanted a reason to monitor my boyfriend's reactions to her behavior) and decided instead to stay and keep chatting with the ladies. I told my boyfriend’s cousin “oh no, how embarrassing for her, let me know if she needs anything” and went back to my conversation. I was fuming mad on the inside but I maintained calm on the outside and eventually my anger dissipated.  


Long story short- she wound up vomiting all over the bathroom floor after the birthday cake was served. Being a good hostess I cleaned it up, gave her some old clothes of mine to change into as she’d thrown up on herself quite a bit, cleaned as much of the vomit out of her hair as I could and helped her boyfriend get her into their car. She texted me the next morning to tell me that she didn’t remember anything but that she had been told she was “a bit of a hot mess”. I decided to go the kind route and told her that I hope she doesn’t have too bad of a hangover and I thanked her for attending. 


My boyfriend saw the text and commented on what a disaster she was and how embarrassed he was for her and how everybody was mortified watching her antics. We talked about it for a while and he said he might say something to her boyfriend as he doesn't understand how he can be with someone who was such a public embarrassment. Then he thanked me for throwing such a wonderful party and said he had a great time!!! I was beaming like an idiot. 


Mission accomplished!

Moral of the story: Trust your man. ACTUALLY trust him. Don’t check up on him to make sure he’s “behaving” and don’t do so “subtly”. Whether or not he notices you’re checking up on him, that kind of behavior just feeds the hamster and reinforces those thoughts in your head. 

PS- I’m open to any critiques about how I handled that! If any of you ladies have any suggestions I’d love to hear them. Not sure if I should have intervened when she was super drunk or if that would have just made me a target for belligerent drunken behavior.

4y77li,Red Pill is power. Here are some (amazing) benefits of taking TRP as a woman,"**Intro:** Men need TRP. Women technically don't. Blue pill women get commitment/validation without needing a special strategy. 

We can pretty much do well for ourselves even without red pill, but I think it comes with amazing benefits for us as individuals so I made a list.

-----

 **Simplified view of the world.**
-----

How simple are we really, as humans? Well.. Wait. Blue Pill wants to answer this one. 

 **Blue pill:** *We are complex individuals, each of us is unique, everybody likes something else, nothing is simple and we re nothing alike.*

There I was, out of college, understanding absolutely nothing about what was around me. Social interactions were weird, I was anxious, I was browsing tumblr and calling myself a feminist. 

The bluepill system loves creating confusion and ambiguity, I simply did not understand what was expected of me and how does everything work. I was confused and scared. 


TRP lays us some universal rules by which us, as humans, think and behave. 

TRP says we're not that damn special. We're mammals, we have instincts, we have needs. We're weak, but by accepting weakness we can build strength. **Redpill is all about the factual, observable reality.**

Post-TRP I understood my place as a woman in society, what I am  valued on, I understood why I was attracted to ""douchebags"" and not ""nice guys"". I understood why girls I considered ""stupid and boring"" (I was jealous of them) were getting guys that would not look at me twice. 

I made sense of things in retrospective. Look back on your teen/young adult years through Red Pill lens, isn't it all just so simple? 

-----


 **Reduced social anxiety**
-----


Maybe this deserve its own post but I will say this: I dropped out of college because I could not handle social anxiety. 
**Since I started reading TRP I have no social anxiety anymore &amp; here's how it worked for me:**

I was hyperventilating reading on TRP  how men rate women on scales from 1-10. In my tumblristic world men never did that. I  had no idea  men rate women like that. I was disappointed. 

To me personality was the most important thing men valued in girls. *""C'mon, there must be some mentions about strong women around here!""*


**Mindblown.**


I realized the lies. I realized that my social anxiety didn't matter. Its source was my inability to meet imaginary expectations in terms of ""my personality."" I was stressing that I was boring and that I was stupid. 

*Should I be witty? What should I say?*

*I don't want to seem dumb, nobody likes a dumb girl. Oh, I must seem fun and bubbly!*

I realize no matter how stupid I am or how boring I am, it just doesn't matter. My role as a woman is not to lead the conversation and be the witty entertainer. If you have social anxiety focus on looking good and polished and getting rid of bitch face (if you posses it). Now relax. Nobody is going to judge you, disqualify you or criticize you based on anything else. 

**The lesser you speak the better, it makes your word valuable.**

Don't ramble like anxious people do. Good posture and body language do all the work.

There's a reason guys at r/TheRedPill ""envy"" our privileged position as women, we honestly don't have that social pressure on us like they do. So make the most of this. 


-----

**No anger, no pettiness.**
-----

Many women are angry and petty, aren't they? Most of them are feminists weirdly.

We here, at r/RedPillWomen seem to be pretty cool &amp; collected. 

When you don't try to change the world to fit your needs and you play by the ancestral rules you are much happier. 


Bluepill tells you that you can change the world.  Do a hashtag. Make a movement. [Run a marathon on your period without a sanitary pad.](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/heres-why-i-ran-the-london-marathon-on-the-first-day-of-my-period-and-chose-not-to-wear-a-tampon-10455176.html) You can change the world, girl! 



Actually you can't and that creates frustration. 

Look on body positive instagram accounts - those girls are rabid. They are angry, they post passive-aggressive quotes and surf the web for articles to be offended by. 

Sounds exhausting to me. 

A RPWoman knows for example that ""f*ckboys"" just follow their interest. Why be angry at biological instincts of mating with as many women as possible?  Why be angry men are attracted to youth? If they weren't, they would have mated with old infertile women. 

**In this subreddit are in a much better place mentally then our blue pill counterparts.** Ever since I understood the rules of nature I cannot be angered by petty things and so should every RPWoman. 

-----

 **The ability to make choices wisely**
-----
If somebody asked my N-count before TRP I would have lied about it saying at least 5. It's...way lower. I didn't want to seem like a loser. 

Yes, I was that programmed. I was that beta that I believed a low N-count is detrimental to my value so **I was willing to say that I slept with at least 5 men, even though I did not.**

I'm sure even some BP women know that a high N-count is unattractive but I didn't. This is called ""projection mentality"". Because a man who sleeps around increases his value, I believed this applies to me also.  Now you can see how easy you can make a bad choice while under blue pill spell. Imagine what kind of choices that mindset would make me do. 

Luckily I took TRP in time and I maintained my integrity.

Blue Pill screws up your choices, your ability to discern things correctly and gives you a set of values that are not real in application. Riding the CC is one of blue pill's main attractions and we know how that turns out. 

In a climate of confusion/ambiguity anything goes, there's no right &amp; wrong (because everybody's different, right?).

 **On the pill the lines are clear and the hamster is silent** - this always leads to better choices.  


-----

**TLDR;** There is so much more to RP than a sexual strategy. Read what I wrote in bold. We're lucky we're out of the matrix. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4y77li/red_pill_is_power_here_are_some_amazing_benefits/,1471457953.0,81,0.87,31,RedPillWomen,cristiana33
4x1f29,"Men say: ""We prefer natural women"". Do they really? RPW perspective on make-up.","**Intro:** I read this all the time, I hear it on TV and each week a new study reveals how much men hate the cakeface and love me all natural. The general consensus is that men prefer natural women. 

Be careful, my fellow RPW! It's a trap.

-----

* **Why it's a trap** 

When men say they want natural women they mean *naturally beautiful women.* 

They want those genes that give you perfect complexion, long eyelashes, full luscious lips naturally so he can be sure you are a great mating prospect. 
When you ""cake"" your face you are hiding the truth about your genes and this gives men mating anxiety. They don't like being lied to. 


-----

* **The catch**

Men value women 99% on looks. Telling a girl to be natural is, in other words telling her: *""I know you can raise your value by 250%, but please don't and be honest, ok?""*

The question is if men could spend 15 min. in the morning doing an activity that skyrockets their SMV and status almost instantly would they do it? 
I bet they would.

-----

* **The morality of ""Too much makeup**

I saw that many women feel guilty looking like something they are not and I understand this because I was like this too. When I started overdrawing my lips I felt like a cheater. This is our sense of morality kicking in. 

We don't like to be fake because it's not fair, it's false advertising. **Problem is we're trying to play fair when the game is rigged.** 

I am judged on something I have no control over like the length of my face or the distance between my eyes. Let's quickly review the ""game"" or ""the system"", whatever you want to call it.

Let's say I was born with a long face, ugly ""witch"" nose and no chin. Amanda was born with cute nose, long legs and baby-face. Now let's start on our paths...

&gt; Amanda wins.

Um..what? But I didn't do anything...

&gt; Sorry, Amanda wins. 

But...I worked hard to...

&gt; Amanda is better, bye. 

The game is not fair in the slightest. You are what you are born with, your face/body influences everything in your life from the day you are born, your interactions, your thoughts, your value. And here we are, on r/RedPillWomen trying to play nicely a game that is rigged from day 1. 

-----

* **Ok, cristiana33, I should cake myself in make-up and call it a day, that's what your saying.**

No, no, no. If you are naturally beautiful I think mascara and some lipgloss are enough. 

I wouldn't do much if I had a naturally great looking face. But not all of us are naturally beautiful, for example I am not. 

What I am challenging here is the ""morality"" of too much makeup and our (foolish) desire to play ""fair"". Our morality which tells us ""maybe I shouldn't deceive people"". Well they will deceive you and will not lose much sleep over it. Men will call you ugly in your face and won't care that you didn't hide those blemishes because you wanted to be ""morally correct"". 

They'll call you ugly and turn their back on you. 

-----

* **So how much make-up??**

How much you want. How much you feel comfortable with. None at all if you don't want to. 

But NEVER try to be ""natural"" for the sake of morality. That's foolish. 


* **But how about when he sees me without make-up?**

If you have naturally pleasant features you're fine. No woman is as beautiful without make-up and nobody expects you to be. If your face is unattractive w/o make-up wake-up early and put your ""minimal face"" on before he wakes up. Simple. 

Women have been doing this for decades before feminism and laziness kicked in. 

-----

**Conclusion:** You can play fair all you want, the system is cruel. You are judged on things that you have no control over. Your desire to be ""natural because you don't want to deceive"" can be detrimental in the path for success. 

**TLDR;** What men actually want is naturally beautiful women. If you're not one of them use all the tools you have to raise your SMV and feel absolutely no shame about it.

4wxn5v,"I came here to poke fun, found myself agreeing, and now it's a serious source of stress for me. How do I deal with this?","The first time I visited this sub was when a friend showed it to me. It was partly her poking fun, and partly out of bafflement that there are women who could think the way you do, and who could be so opposed to feminism. At the time I agreed with her, but I was baffled and confused by the beliefs espoused here, and that got me curious. I started reading, and was angry and confused to find myself agreeing with a lot of what RedPillWomen has to say. 

 

I’ve delved deeper and deeper, and it just gets worse and worse. I’m kind of at this place where I feel lost, and don’t know how to handle it. I’m 18, and starting college soon, so this is not really happening at a great time for me either. I also feel a bit isolated because I feel like my friends would crucify me if I even hinted I was struggling with this, so I thought maybe I would turn to you all because this where it started and at some point many of you have probably gone through the same thing.

 

I realize the rules said to try and avoid posting a wall of text, so I’ll try to limit the background information I give. My parents are divorced, and my mom has always urged me to excel and prove that I can do anything boys can do, and I really took that to heart. Feminism was a big part of my identity and worldview, and I had always felt obligated to shirk gender roles and femininity (though never really managed that last part).

 

I feel like a big part of why I’ve started paying attention to what’s said here, is that just paying attention to the message has caused me to examine the two examples of people in relationships I’ve had in my life, my mother and father. When my dad divorced my mom I was mad at him, he was the bad guy. Looking back now though, of course he did. She was, as you might say, a shrew. She was and still is constantly bitter about everything and extremely negative, and he always seemed tired. Even now, she’s still alone and bitter. Trying to conform to her expectations sucks my energy too. I don’t want to end up like her.

 

My dad on the other hand, has remarried. My stepmother is such a nice person, and in a lot of ways I can be myself more with her than with my mom. Her and my dad’s relationship is very happy, and she’s constantly supportive and he’s way more assertive. It was actually source of conflict in my relationship with them with him taking charge and her supporting, because I was critical of it for years. His parenting became more hands on and I resented him imposing structure that my mom did and also judged my step mom for being a housewife even though she’s been nothing but kind to me. It’s only since reading this sub that I’ve realized how awful I’ve been to them at times, and how I’ve been angry at my dad for doing his job and being the only one of my two parents to actually teach me any responsibility or structure. I am grateful for how my relationship with both of them has improved for the better as I’ve tried to be more positive and respectful, deferring to their judgement more, but even that’s hard sometimes.

 

I guess what I want to do is ask how some of you have coped with, “taking the pill.” I still feel like I’m some sort of traitor for the way my thinking of changes, for realizing that a career and proving myself equal isn’t the thing I want most in life. How do I go from where I was to this? How do I stop myself from lashing out at others unfairly when I get confused? Also, how do I find friends that I can talk about this with? Lastly, and this it the weirdest one, how do I stop feeling guilty for actually wanting and being okay with the pill? I feel like, while there’s a lot of hard truth, I do want to accept those truths. They say the truth will set you free, but it’s like my subconscious is viscerally opposed to letting that happen.

 

(Also, I apologize if this seems directionless at times. I was a bit emotional when I wrote it. If this doesn’t belong here, I also apologize for that.)

4wj2ju,"Former promiscuous woman and feminist, now submissive but independent woman. Recovering from years of promiscuity and being the woman my man needs me to be","I used to be the typical sexually liberated feminist who later realized she was getting the short end of the stick no matter how hard she tried to lock down men. I thought that men would be more attracted to a woman who was sexually unapologetic. Someone who is great in the sack and won't be a nag if he didn't give her attention. 

I was the strong feminist girl who was going to get a high powered career before even thinking of marriage. Growing old alone was an option too. It was when I started reading this blog by Renee (http://www.thefemininewoman.com) did I learn more about my true nature as a woman. I listened to my heart, the true woman in me, and I could feel her calling, begging me to stop what I was doing. 

I kept nodding at all the points that Renee discussed in her blog. That women are denying themselves the happiness they're looking for by chasing their career, material things, sexual liberation, and all that. She was right. I tried to apply my newly learned lessons to my relationship at that time. I did all the household work. I was more expressive of my emotions. While still maintaining independence working two jobs. This narcissist I was with took advantage of me. I thought that by changing the way I behaved, he would be inspired to change too. But there's no hope when it comes to these people because even they cannot see through their own bullshit.

I finally ended the highly toxic relationship after seven grueling months before I met my true equal. My alpha. My soulmate. The man who I know will protect me and provide for our future family.

The previous relationship damaged me but not so much that it kept me from opening my heart to this new man. He was everything I had been looking for and if not without my knowledge on the red pill and true femininity, I wouldn't have been ready to handle a man such as him.

I make him happy, and he makes me happy. Sometimes, I will purposely act all cute around him and let him chase me around the room because it's exciting. It gives us both the andrenaline rush you rarely see in most couples these days where the woman is so uptight and the man is too afraid to approach her for fear of her wrath. 

I donno. Maybe it's just me but there are too many more women in the society that I live in who are still asleep and enjoying the feminist dream. I want to help them realize what I realized. I cannot count with my toes and fingers alone the number of men I have slept with. I thought it liberated me to sleep with men without feeling any remorse but in the recent years, it has only made me feel shitty.

Even though I am happy in my relationship right now, I suffer from the choices I have made in the past. I have difficulties creating a bond with my partner and sometimes I feel like I am a fraud when I'm being affectionate to him. I know that I really do love him but I doubt my emotions sometimes. I recently discovered that it's probably my low oxytocin levels because of the many men I have slept with in the past. I felt bad but there's no use dwelling in the past. The only way to repair it is to increase oxytocin levels which I found out can be achieved through hugging, kissing, expressing your emotions. Basically things that you would do to express affection to your partner.

I am very happy with where I am right now. I cannot believe a simple woman like me would be able to ignite such a huge change in the man of my dreams, who once had a dark past too and sometimes, continues to have a dark outlook in life. He worships me, and I submit to him. What an amazing thing we women can achieve if we just surrender.

Ladies, if you are looking for true love, you won't find it through a hook up or a friends with benefits arrangement though that have worked for some. I am saying. We are a rare breed. Many men have lost hope in women because of the man hating culture that the feminist movement has created. Don't be one of those women who will insult him, embarrass him in front of his friends, or backbite him to your girlfriends.

Remember to respect him. It's really that simple. Men just want to be respected. You are both in the same team. How would you treat someone who is in your team for life? With love and respect.
 
It's hard for a man to look for a real woman these days. By being the exception, you might just be the catalyst for him to becoming the man he needs to be. I never believed in soulmates before.

4w0g1b,"Who is Red Pill for, anyway?","This may have turned into a bit of a rant. I had an interesting interaction with a user today. He was upset because he felt that the direction of this sub has been lost and that we have essentially devolved into a sub that teaches old sluts how to reel in a BB. This lead me to ask the question, *who is Red Pill for?* 

Red Pill is for women who have realized that the liberal, feminist agenda that we are indoctrinated with all of our lives is not making them happy. It is for the ladies who think, ""there must be a better way to interact with my SO, there has to be another dynamic than this current one that isn't working."" 

It's for the 18 year old virgin who's never had a serious boyfriend. But, and this seems to be where this particular fellow had a problem, it's also for the 28 year old who realizes she wasted her youth on the wrong priorities and is looking for help to fix them. It's for the 35 year old divorced mother who is looking to fix the problems and ideologies she has been using and find a good man. 

Sure, some men may think that some ladies are just trying to have their cake and eat it too, but to that I say, how can you tell the difference between one women who is genuinely trying to better herself and the one who is doing it to be manipulative? You can't, so err on the side of caution and help everyone. 

Yes, some guys are going to be turned off by your age, your children, your divorce history, your party girl past. That's a natural consequence of life. Did you know a better way at the time? The answer doesn't matter because it doesn't effect the outcome. The point is, you're here *now*. You're looking to fix things *now*. 

We all have a past and while some may condemn you for it, others won't. Those are the men you are bettering yourself for. Some men who are angry or bitter and come here may say they're all betas or they're low quality men but if you see quality in this man, who is some stranger on the Internet to tell you you're wrong? 

Ladies, we are in a much better position than or feminist counterparts, no matter what age you swallow the pill. I'm not encouraging a ""team woman"" attitude and I'm certainly not encouraging the women looking to glean what they can from the sub for their own manipulative game. 

When I look at posts for advice or field reports and see some posters condemning those of us who have the courage to open up about our past mistakes, it really irritates me. Red pill is about seeing reality for what it is and using it to live your life the best way you can. You can't un-ride the CC and you can't go back in time to hunt for a husband at 23. Start where you're at now. The journey is still worthwhile. Don't let the occasional bitter poster bring you down. 

I truly believe in this journey, I know it has changed my life and marriage for the absolute better. I certainly wish I had found it earlier in my 20's than I did, but the point is, I did indeed find the Red Pill. This journey, this mind set, this lifestyle, this praxeology, is a truly indispensable thing to integrate into your life and a cause I very strongly believe in.

4tafpv,What To Do When Your Captain Won't Lead,"So you’ve found Red Pill Women. You’ve read the popular posts. You’re ready to start surrendering and being a great first mate! The problem? Your husband isn’t stepping up. You feel defeated. Why isn’t this working?! It *must* be him. He isn’t leading like the sub said he would. ‘How do you fix this?’ You ask. 


First and foremost, you can’t change your man. You also can’t demand he be the leader and take charge. For one, he probably won’t know what you’re talking about, and for two, that’s called leading from behind the scenes or topping from the bottom. This is not true surrendering, not true following your captain’s lead. So how do we do it? Men are simple, straightforward creatures. They don’t understand subtle or even **obvious** hints. So cut it out, and stop being passive aggressive when he doesn’t get it. 
One of my favorite manosphere bloggers, Ian Ironwood, wrote a great article about [encouraging men to lead:](http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/girl-game-extend-invitation.html)

&gt; It’s not that these dudes are duds, understand. In almost every case they are good, decent, kind men who have dedicated themselves to their families and their wives. It’s not that they lack devotion, understand – most are filled with good intentions and a deep-seated desire to succeed. What they often lack is understanding.

&gt; Oftentimes these men have grown up cowed, with distant or absent fathers and strong, sometimes even domineering mothers. They have been taught by society that their masculinity is a stain they must overcome, and they approach their duties as father and husband like *penance*, not a *prize* hard won.

#**Taming of the Shrew**
Depending on how shrew-like you have been in your marriage and for how long, you have contributed to your husband’s betafication. So first and foremost, let’s make sure that we have fixed that problem. Always be working on yourself, putting your best foot forward, not nagging, always encouraging, sweet, helpful, a good first mate. Even one slip up in a heated moment can tear down what took him a month to build up.
Progress can be slow, based on your husband’s beta tendencies in general, how long/how bad your lack of submission contributed to the problem, and how quickly you internalize RPW. Please remember that this is your husband’s journey, not yours. Don’t rush him or goad him into progress. That will not work.

Based on articles written by Ian Ironwood and the book The Surrendered Wife by Laura Doyle, here are my tips for encouraging your husband to lead you and your family!


#**Don’t phrase it as a question** 
...Rather a statement.  “I’d like to know what you want for dinner.” Men are used to deferring to their wives’ wishes and whims in the interest of equality. When you phrase something as a statement rather than a question, you make a decision his. You are deferring and he is put in charge of a decision. Laura Doyle says that if he tries to hand you back the reins, you should simply reply, “whatever you think,” each time he tries to do this. I did this with my husband as he was shopping for his car. It works for any situation! For dinner plans, for buying a car, anything!

*Example 1* 
RPW: I’d like to know what you want for dinner.

DH: I don’t care. What do you feel like making? 

RPW: Whatever you’d like.

I will add that your Captain’s personality type (greater beta, alpha, sigma etc) greatly affects the way his leadership emerges and how it appears. It will take you knowing your captain to flesh out whether he is **still** trying to kowtow to your authority or if he is actually delegating. In the beginning, depending on the degree of beta and how long/how bad the dynamic has been in your household, your husband will most likely be more blue pill and inclined to let you lead but as your relationship evolves, you will need to use your judgement about which situations he is actually delegating to you. 
Wives may have to surrender a lot at first to fix a husband who stopped leading in the face of her prior overdominance. However, over-submission can become a burden to the relationship once he starts taking control of more areas of life and delegating certain ones to his First Mate.
Instead of offering open-ended questions to the Captain about tasks delegated, a good First Mate will offer her Captain choices that contain the information he requires to make a decision.

*Example 1a*
RPW: (knowing there is ground beef) Would you like beef stroganoff or meatloaf tonight for dinner?

*Example Two*

 DH: We have an extra $200 this month. Should we pay down debt or put it into the savings? 

RPW: Whatever you think is just fine with me, babe!

DH: I'd really like your input though, especially since you make the payments.

RPW: We have about $XXXX in savings and $XXX with 18% interest on the credit card.

After the decision has been made, you can’t criticize it. This can be the most difficult part, especially when he makes a decision you don’t like. You don’t like what he picked for dinner? Shut up. Think you should have paid off the credit card? Shut up. When you make the decision to make it his decision you have to leave it there. If you take it back and say “I think we should do it this way,” or “No, I don’t like that,” it makes him feel as if he has failed some sort of test in your eyes. Once again, he can’t do a single thing right to please his wife. I like to ask myself “is this the hill I want to die on?” which is basically me asking myself how important this decision is and is it worth potentially tearing down my man by questioning his decisions and setting your captain-first mate dynamic back who knows how long.

#**""But what if he messes up?""** 

It is not a matter of *if* he will mess up, but rather *when* he will mess up. He is guaranteed to, he is human. You mess up too, sometimes really badly, he just most likely doesn’t rake you over the coals about it. Each time your husband makes a mistake he is learning. He feels the responsibility and any associated feelings (humiliation, fear, failure). He needs a soft place to land, a supportive and loving wife. I know some women are thinking, “I’m not allowed to be upset? His decisions affect *me*!” 

Sure you are. But you don’t get to rip him a new one. You *do* get to help him dust himself off and watch as he fixes the problem. When he messes up, do not jump in to help. Do not reassume control. This will be hard, especially in the heat of the moment. Resist the urge! Let your husband figure it out for himself. Laura Doyle wrote something that resonated with me early on in my RPW journey: “Your husband manages to communicate, problem solve, and produce in his job. Clearly he has the skills to do the same at home.” What a simple yet powerful notion! He is capable!

#**Encourage an Alpha Presentation**

Ian Ironwood also uses this suggestion for encouraging your husband to [assume leadership:](http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2014/09/girl-game-encouraging-your-captain-to.html)

&gt;Simply put, a way to quietly encourage a man toward a more Alpha presentation is to put him in situations in which you would like him to display Alpha, and then quietly invite him to do so without judgment or rejection.
You can do this in a number of ways. He goes on to tell a story of when he and the now Mrs. Ironwood were dating, she asked him to come along with her to her father’s house to drop off a gift for him. She included that he may have been drinking and that she would appreciate his company in case things got out of hand. What sort of man can refuse a favor like that?! She asked him to go as her protector. Men love feeling needed for the masculine abilities and protection is a huge one. 

Helen Andelin, in *Fascinating Womanhood* lists the traits men love to be noticed and complimented on: 

 * his masculine body

 * skills and abilities

 * achievements, goals and dreams

 * masculine traits of character 

 * his masculine role

When trying to tailor a situation to your husband that would quietly encourage an alpha presentation, look for ones that will highlight these subjects and you’re sure to get a win.

#**Conclusion**

As you continue with your RPW journey, please remember that not all men are alike and not all men are alphas. There is a wide spectrum of male personalities and truthfully not all of us ladies would do well with an alpha. My husband is a man I would classify as a “greater beta”. He is someone who possesses leadership qualities however he will not step up if someone else is willing to hop in the driver’s seat. The hardest part for me was to overcome the tendency to dominate him and keep myself in my own seat. At first I was disappointed because I thought red pill wouldn’t work for us. But then I realized, I am judging DH based on what I think a leader looks like and how I would do things if I was leading. I need to watch him and how he leads, which is super laid back and almost looks like he isn’t at all. But he does, in his relaxed, undemanding way. I just have to learn to stay out of his way.

Good luck, be patient, and don't give up! This journey is so worthwhile!

4rwfcj,The Wife Tests,"#**Wife Tests: A Single Girl’s Guide to Being Wife Potential, Part I**

Anyone who has ever spent any time in the manosphere has heard of Ian Ironwood. The man is a genius. I was recently going through some of his posts on his blog and I began re-reading the series he wrote called “Wife Tests”. Now, Ian writes mostly for the male perspective but this series is helpful not only for men but also to women. There have been a few posts from lurkers or new posters asking about ways to improve their girl game or to up their game for future or current relationships. This series will be super helpful for RPW’s new and experienced to read as it serves to instruct and remind us of everything we could be doing. I encourage every lady to read this series but as Ian is a tad verbose at times, I’ve added my own Spark Notes version here. Enjoy!

*Please note that when clicking on the links, Mr. Ironwood has retro pin-up-esque photos peppered throughout his posts, some of which may not be appropriate to view at work or around the presence of children. They are not pornographic by a long shot but some are definitely risqué.*

 * [Red Pill Alerts:](http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2013/09/wife-test-red-pill-alerts.html)

This first article is a litany of phrases or utterances that can and should throw up red flags to men vetting a potential partner. 
The first and most obvious red flag to everyone here should be a woman using the term **“rape culture”**. 

Anyone uttering this phrase without a trace of humor or sarcasm will most definitely turn into a raging fem-nazi once the honeymoon period is over in a relationship. I don’t feel a need to harp on this phrase for any length of time as I’m certain we are all aware of how over used this phrase is among the feminist army. Fellas, stay away from this kind of woman, ladies, do not be this type of woman. You will nail yourself a low value beta using this mentality as any captain worth his salt wouldn’t touch you with a ten foot pole. 

The second “red flag phrase” is **“delicate male ego”**. 

This one should also be relatively self-explanatory. If a woman doesn’t respect a man, *all* of a man (including his ego) he will not be properly satisfied in a relationship. Everyone has an ego and everyone loves to have someone else build them up (particularly if that other person is attractive).  To be a woman who not only won’t build him up and stroke his ego (no matter how silly you personally may think it is) but will actually *tear down* his ego (and thus sense of worth in a relationship) is not an ideal candidate for a wife. 

The third and final example I will pull off the list is the phrase **“I want to work on my career”**.

 Now many women, especially those newer to RPW may prickle at this being a red flag. Practically all women today assume (wrongly) that being highly educated will add to the sexual attractiveness. This is not the case. Men may be impressed or think you accomplished, however a fancy degree or a fancy job do not add to your SMV at all. In fact, Mr. Ironwood postures that it is a red flag for women to say “I want to work on my career” and I can see why. If you and a potential mate are on one of your first dates or just getting to know each other, you are essentially telling him that your career comes first, before anything, including him. No man wants to hear that. 
&gt;“A woman who sees herself as a professional first will only see herself as a wife and mother second.”

 * [A Good Worker:]( http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-wife-test-good-worker.html)

I purposely listed this article after the last bullet point because the two seem to conflict with each other. They do not. Mr. Ironwood clears up this seeming hypocrisy by explaining:
&gt; “Being “a good worker” isn’t just an evaluation about her employment status and potential, it’s an evaluation of her character when you broaden your scope to include old-fashioned housework and industry in general.”

Basically this article is discussing what to look for in a woman to ensure that she is not lazy or simply looking for a man to take care of her, rather she is someone who will do a fair share of the work and also care for her man. This is a rather important green flag us ladies will want to fly high when being vetted by a potential man! 
Whether your goal is to stay home after marriage and/or children or continue working, there are a few things you should keep in mind now to ensure you are sending the appropriate signals. 

Firstly, a woman who won’t work is obviously a red flag. But almost as big of a turn off is a woman who doesn’t know when to stop working or forgets why or who she is working for. /u/SuperSlavisWife just posted a fantastic article a few days ago entitled “Laissez-Faire Homemaking” in which she tells of the dangers and pitfalls of trying to make your home perfect all the time. One such pitfall is becoming a tyrant in your own home. Insisting on perfection all the time puts your husband and kids on edge and does not make the home a happy, inviting place. Such a woman has forgotten whom she is working for. Who are you intending to serve by homemaking? Your answer should be ‘your family’. They shouldn’t be being terrorized for the sake of the picture perfect home. So while it is important to not sit on the couch all day watching *The Price is Right* all day, it is also important to not become “Monster Stewart”. 
For those women who are in the work force, it is important to remember that you have a family and to save some of yourself every day for them. Careers are important but not as important as your marriage and your family. 

So how can single ladies demonstrate their ambition and industriousness? Ian answers this in the form of questions men should be asking themselves. Read the full list on his blog but a few of them are:

 * Does she ask for help even if she doesn’t need it? (Laziness)

 * Does she try to get you to do her work for her? (Laziness, manipulation)

 * Does she have a hard time planning the project? (Lack of ambition, trouble planning for the future, laziness)

 * Does she clean up after herself?

 * Can she stop the job short of perfection? (knowing when to stop working)

 * Does she take pride in the work she does?

 * Does she need you to watch and/or act as a cheerleader for her efforts? (validation-seeking, low self-esteem, attention seeking)

These and the other questions listed are important in determining in ourselves the message we are sending to our men. I encourage you to read the list and answer honestly, using introspection to identify potential places of improvement within yourself.

 *  [Domesticity:](http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-wife-test-domesticity.html)

The final wife test I’m going to touch on today is “domesticity”. 
&gt;  One of the things a man seeks and finds value in when he is looking for his wife is someone with whom he can make a home.

What a surprise. A man wants a woman who knows how to make a home an inviting, warm, soft place to land. Unfortunately because of the feminist movement eschewing any sort of activity related to feminine homemaking, it is a dying art. I myself had no idea how to add special little touches to my own apartment (and worse, I didn’t realize they were missing!) My mother-in-law was the one who taught me the importance of homemaking and what an art it truly is. She showed me how a table cloth and some candles make dinner more special, how fresh flowers placed in a simple vase dress up a window, and overall how these small touches contribute to a house feeling like a home. It is definitely an art many women nowadays do not know how to create. 

Little things Ian encourages men to look for in a woman’s home (and thus little touches you can add to yours) are listed in their entirety on this blog post. A few include:

 * house plants 

 * cat/dog – how well are they cared for, groomed, the attention paid to them (all relates to you being able to dote on another living breathing creature. If you don’t want a pet please skip this suggestion!)

 * general décor – does your house give off a warm, cozy feeling or does it feel like you cleaned out the sale section of Target? Are the pieces original and cohesive to give the house an overall feel or  is the paint and decorations discordant? 

 * is the trash and/or laundry piling up – obvious housekeeping skills 

That’s all for now, I thank you for reading and hope that these articles will be helpful in stepping up your girl game for your partner, either current or anticipated! I’ll post part two in a few days.

4qshzy,Lessons from Fido: How to Be a Better First Mate,"There have been a lot of great posts lately from women who are new to swallowing the Red Pill asking how to be more feminine.  Looking the part is easy, but it's the behavior change that's difficult.  Personally, I wear dresses and heels more often, but my mannerisms are still about as sexy as [decapodian mating rituals](http://i.imgur.com/n5XhtQZ.png) (GRAW!).  I'd never want to change that about myself, but I can still behave in a feminine, submissive way, and I need look no further than my dog for instructions.

&amp;nbsp;


**There Are Few Other Creatures So Genuinely Happy to See You**

Dog parents, you know what I'm talking about.  You come home from a long day at work, and as soon as you walk through the door you're immediately bombarded with doggy kisses (""HELLO! HELLO! HI! HI! HELLO!"").  Who doesn't like being greeted this way?  No man wants to come home to a shrew that ignores him, or worse, instantly besots him with chores and responsibilities.  I'm not saying you should lick your man's face (or other body parts . . . *heh*) the second he comes home, but I guarantee he'll look forward to coming home if you greet him at the door with a smile on your face.

Greeting him at the door will be easier to do if you're a SAHM.  But if you work and come home later than he does, you can still brighten his day by doing the same thing as soon as *you* walk through the door.  

&amp;nbsp;


**Following the Alpha**

Dogs need, understand, and respect a hierarchy.  In order for them to be happy, they have to know where they stand in the pack.  They need an alpha to tell them what to do, and it is their responsibility to follow.  That's not to say that you aren't entitled to voice your opinion if something is seriously wrong, but pick your battles; mutiny is not an option.  You should never counter your Captain's directives unless he is doing something tremendously stupid, like gambling away the mortgage payments, or getting behind the wheel while drunk--in which case you should probably find a new Captain if he constantly makes poor decisions.  So long as you have a responsible Captain, a good sex life, a roof over your head, and food on the table, what do you *really* have to complain about?

&amp;nbsp;


**Dogs Don't Bring You Their Problems**

Dogs don't hold grudges, and they don't complain about every little thing that bothers them.  When they see you, they are nothing but a bundle of pure joy and energy.  Men love feminine women because feminine women bring light to the otherwise cold, dark world in which men have to prove themselves just to survive.  They solve problems and do work all day long, so the last thing they want is to do more work when they come home.  Men are natural problem-solvers, so if you bring him a problem, make sure it's something worthy of his time and attention.  Otherwise, you'll just tire him out.

On that note, this is why having a circle of female friends is helpful.  Women understand that 99% of the time you're complaining about something, it's because you want someone to listen to you rant/vent.  So if you have a problem that isn't worth bringing up to your Captain, talking through it with other women is a win-win situation for all parties involved.  You get someone who will happily listen to to you vent and bond with you over it (girltalk FTW!), and your Captain gets to spend his time with a happy First Mate.

&amp;nbsp;


**Dogs Are Always Down for Whatever**

Our canine friends are enthusiastic to do just about anything you want to do.  You can almost see them thinking, ""Taking a walk? *My favorite thing!*  Playing fetch?  *My favorite thing!*  Chilling on the couch?  *MY FAVORITE THING!!*""  A good Captain will choose a movie, restaurant, or $ThingToDoTogether that both he and his First Mate will like.  It's your responsibility as a good First Mate to be enthusiastic about whatever your Captain chooses because you're trusting that you two will have a good time no matter what.  Femininity is about complementing the masculinity of your man, which you can't achieve if you're challenging him at every turn.

&amp;nbsp;


**Dogs Are Loyal**

I don't really need to explain the *Homeward Bound* or *Lassie* kind of loyalty you see in dogs, but I'd like to expand on this in terms of the benefits of dogs showing preference for their masters.  My dog respects both my Captain and me, but he has had her since she was a puppy, while I've only been a step-pet parent for the last year.  Obviously, she's very happy to see me, but she goes completely *BONKERS* for my Captain when she sees him.  If I'm taking her out on a walk and my Captain is not there, she'll keep looking back at the house as if to say, ""But where's Dad?"" 

Say your level of enthusiasm is at a 6/10 when you're seeing friends (male or female).  Turn it up to an 8 or 9 when your Captain walks into the room and I guarantee he'll love the attention you're showing for *just him.*  You don't have to be obnoxious about it, but make it publicly clear that he is special and valuable to you.  This, in turn, raises his value in the eyes of others.

&amp;nbsp;

**To sum it up:**

* Always be happy to see him.
* Follow his lead, and be enthusiastic about it.
* Don't burden him with stupid problems.
* Raise his value--and yours--by publicly showing preference for him.

&amp;nbsp;

**Bottom Line:**  Feminists reading this are probably thinking, ""OMG rproller is telling us womyn that we have to act like ***dogs*** to please men! *I'M SO TRIGGERED*""  This is not a call for women to be lapdogs--figuratively or literally.  All I'm trying to say in this post is that there are traits I've observed in my own experiences with dogs that make people happy, and you can mimic some of those traits to make your Captain happy.

4qbex2,Came here to judge. Stayed because you ladies are brilliant,"I came across this sub a few months ago when I was grossed out by some of the attitudes on r/TheRedPill. I'm not going to lie; I came here to judge what I thought would be silly, man-obsessed, insecure women. Boy was I wrong.  
  
I must have spent a whole afternoon devouring the top posts, tutting as I went along because I was purposely seeking out 'extreme' views to validate my preconceptions. I kept coming back because I was fascinated! A few weeks in, I started to really think about what you were posting and how a lot of it made sense. I realised that so many women on here are brilliant and interesting and that are diverging from what we're told we should be doing as 21st century women and that it was making your lives all the better for it.  
  
While I believe I will never subscribe to the RPW philosophy 100%, I wanted to let you know that this sub has made massive changes in my life over the past 3 months. Before, I thought that even though I was about 30lbs overweight, a man should be interested in who I was. Now I've realised, why should he? I've lost 12lbs lately and started dressing more feminine which makes such a difference in the way people seem to view me. I've started acting more feminine and listening to men more, rather than getting super drunk all the time and trying to act like I'm ""just one of the guys"" which is what I thought guys wanted. I've started trying to make myself the sort of person a good quality man would want to be with, not just for the sake of an LTR, but for myself. I can't even describe it here (especially since I'm on my mobile) but the whole way I view the world is different.  
  
When I find the right person for my next LTR, I have so many plans for how I'll do it differently than before. I'll do more sweet things for him, I'll keep working at trying to be attractive to him, I'll be sexually available to him, I'll let him feel like he's a man! It's all thanks to you wonderful women. I feel so guilty for judging you all so harshly before.  
  
Like I said, there are many elements of TRP that are not for me, but what I've learnt from this sub is invaluable. I think a lot of women could benefit from RPW like I have and I want to thank you all for sharing your insights.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4qbex2/came_here_to_judge_stayed_because_you_ladies_are/,1467143508.0,116,0.96,5,RedPillWomen,spoonboom

4n6uxj,Keeping Score in Your Relationship,"Do you keep score in your relationship? Are your sure? It's harder to pin point than you think, but not as hard a habit to break as you'd think. Here are two of the most common ways we as women ""keep score"":

**""He doesn't love me as much as I love him because he didn't do x!""** 
Men and women are different. We all learned that in health class. But the anatomical differences are only the beginning. Our minds are completely different and we reason and operate completely differently, despite what the feminist agenda would have you believe. The way you would solve a problem or draw a conclusion is vastly different from how your SO would. Women focus on the emotional, we can empathize, we pick up on body language and the inflection of one's voice and try and determine what the person *actually* meant. Men listen to the words. (Men feel free to comment if I left any part out, but I am making generalizations here for both genders.) 

To conclude that your SO doesn't love you because he doesn't solve a problem or handle a situation the way you would is a ludicrous. Has it ever occurred to you that you may not always handle a situation or problem the way he would want you to? There are two sides to every coin. You're not happy with every conclusion he's ever drawn? Guess what my dear, he's not happy with all of yours either. 


**""I do x, y and z everyday and he complains whenever I ask him to do the dishes!""** 
Women seem to think that they are the ones doing more in a relationship. All the time. And they seem to love to be martyrs, thinking they're doing everything so they can throw it in their man's face at a later time. 
Just because you know the *perfect* way to load the dishwasher or you think the kitchen floor should be swept every night before bed doesn't mean he agrees. Who put you in charge of setting the bar of cleanliness in the house anyway? If the house is your ""domain"" and you think you have the best way to do everything, then feel free to do the work. 

Your SO and you will see differently on subjects and just because his bar isn't as high as yours doesn't mean he's wrong. Maybe you are, ever think of that? Maybe your SO doesn't mind the floors feeling a little crunchy or if there's dinner dishes in the sink. But you do. Well go ahead and do them. Why do you get to bitch at him for something you want done? 

Obviously each couple has a different way they split up the chores and share the housework but what it comes down to is this: if it's your SO's job to fold the towels than don't criticize the way he does it. STFU or do it yourself. It doesn't mean he loves you less or that you're better, it means he doesn't care if all the forks are facing the same way in the silverware tray. 

This doesn't just apply to housework, this is just the most popular complaint I see. It applies to raising kids and work outside the home as well. Just because he does it different doesn't mean he does it wrong. Being judgemental in your attitude is condescending and bitchy and will hurt your relationship. 

**Breaking the habit** 
Keeping score is detrimental to the harmony and intimacy in your relationship. Putting yourself in the position of judging makes you feel like you're the more superior and will tear down your SO and put up a a wall in your relationship. Keeping score comes out in a variety of ways including using a harsh tone when he does something, rolling your eyes, scolding, nagging and bitching. Feel like your SO is pulling away from you? Who would want to be close to somebody who makes them feel like less of a person 24/7? 

Luckily, it's an easy habit to fix. I recommend:

* Make a list of all of your SO's good traits and the nice things he's done and does do for you. The more you start thinking about it, the more you'll find! Refer back to this list whenever you feel the resentment building up or the hamster start spinning. 

* ""Is this the hill I want to die on?"" I love asking myself this when I get aggravated. Is this the event that I want to set the tone for the day? Is this the fight I want to have? Is this the thing that I am willing to sacrifice the harmony in my relationship for? The answer 9.5 times out of 10 is no. So I drop it. 

* Ask yourself why is what he's doing or not doing making you feel like you need to keep score. Typically it will be a ""you"" problem and not a ""him"" problem. 

* In her book *The Surrendered Wife*, Laura Doyle points out the obvious to us and says that every time we doubt our man (or judge him) we are doing the same to ourselves. We chose this man. Did we really choose so poorly? 

I hope some of the advice and examples I gave ring true to some of you ladies and I hope it helps you with your relationships. Red pill changed my life and marriage for the absolute better but it takes a lot of work to get there. But it is so worth it. It's a journey that is never quite finished no matter how long you've been practicing but it does get easier.

4kmcyl,There's a Pair of Sneakers in My Closet,"When I was a nerdy girl who didn't focus much on my appearance, I used to think that there was some advantage to dressing “practically” over “prettily”.

A girl who didn't fuss with her appearance was ready and willing to go on any kind of adventure on a moment's notice. She was the kind of girl who would the boys would want to play with, because she didn't care if her hair or makeup got messed up. Of course, I was only trying internally justify my unwillingness to improve myself.

After a re-haul of my wardrobe and look, I started wearing make-up, heels and skirts. I started wearing these kinds of clothes almost everywhere I went. I wore these clothes to work, to the grocery store, and to the doctor's office. However, I always kept a pair of sneakers in my closet in case the occasion called for them. So, at a moment's notice I could go hiking, or camping. 

There is a misconception that in order to become feminine, we have to be *only* feminine, and give up the parts of ourselves that may not be traditionally feminine. However, in spite of wanting to be feminine, there are times when our other traits can come in handy. Our willingness to be able to go outside and play with the boys does not have to go away when you learn how to behave more femininely. In fact, men love a feminine woman who also has the ability to relate to them. It's like having an extra special-something that makes you unique. Like frosting on a cake. 

Yes, be pretty. Yes, be feminine. But also be willing to share in the activities you can do with your SO. I go hiking, go-kart racing, and indoor shooting with my SO. He thinks it's neat that I am a decent shot, and that my degree in STEM lets me understand when he speaks math to me. These things aren't necessary for attraction, these are the nice-to-haves. It is not only okay to be able to do these things, it is good. 

It is good to have a pair of sneakers in your closet. They don't have to be your everyday shoe choice, just store them in your closet in case you need them.

4h06r7,I've started hating my fellow woman.,"I found TRP a year ago, and right away thought ""HOW DARE THEY"" and slowly, after lurking for so long, and sifting through the threads, I realize ""Fuck, they're right with a lot of this"".


Now, I've started hating women, as a woman who has always thought of myself as a feminist (a feminist who wants men to have parental rights, who wants men to have their own birth control, who enjoys baking, sewing, video games and fishing all at the same time). I have realized the term ""feminism"" has been tarnished, and even the people in the women related forums bring up points that are exactly what real feminism fought against (ex. have a baby, disappear for years and then come back to demand money from a guy you didn't bother to inform about the pregnancy in the first place)


I don't know how to go back to being proud to be a woman, now that I see how fucking terrible we can be, to one another and to men.


Did anyone else go through this? Does it ever go away?

4ebnsb,Passion,"* Men want women with a low (ideally zero) partner count. 

* Men want women to leap into bed with them as soon as possible. 

We know both of these things to be true because we see them every day. And when we see both, we are confused. Surely men make no sense at all! Aren't these two things contradictory? 

And our whole society is caught in a war between two cultures. 

The tradcon side, which is slowly losing, says 

* ""Men, you must give up the desire for a woman to sexually surrender quickly... instead, you must invest time and resources in her, make her promises you cannot easily break, before she will give you what you desire.""

* ""Women, you must restrain your desires and be calculating. It is your job to test a man's commitment to you and make him jump through many hoops (ideally on fire) before he gets access to your precious lady parts.""


The liberal side, which is slowly winning, says

* ""Men, you must give up your desire not to marry the town bicycle. You must learn to cherish women who were ploughed bny the entire football team at the same drunken party, and that was just the begining. Women own their own sexuality... they also own your reaction to what they just did; make sure it's the approved one.""


* ""Women, do whatever you want. We'll make sure the men are docile and obedient."" 


The tiny, unnoticed redpill side rolls its eyes, and says:

* You cannot tell men to ""give up"" this or that desire. Desire is not a choice. Desire cannot be negotiated. If men want both these things, then the girl who achieves the most of both will have the most desireable men. 

* And here's a [long complicated explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1j0n7t/the_slut_and_how_not_to_be_one/) of why these things can coexist, which lots of people will read and not understand. 


So the liberal and tradcon answers are just plain wrong. 

And the red pill answer has [too much boring math](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1n149v/is_the_number_of_guys_a_girl_has_been_with_really/cceqjhy).  

Time to simplify. 

**Why** do men want low-count women? **Why** do men want sexually eager women?

**Passion. Men want women who are passionate about them.**

A woman who is passionate about a man does not consult her girlfriends about what an ""acceptable"" amount of time to ""make him wait"" is. A woman who is passionate about a man does not bargain the promise of her body for a wedding, like some jaded whore negotiating a ""session"". A woman who is passionate about a man will find a way to reach his bed. She will fly across the country, crawl under barbed wire, climb in through his second story window, do everything he desires, and wait patiently inside his closet if his wife comes home early from work. 

**Women do not withhold sex from men they are passionate about. A woman is not passionate about a man if she withholds sex from him.** Unless she is seriously physically ill, or *on fire at that very moment*, she is ready when he is. 

Similarly, a woman who has tasted a hundred men over her thirty years of life is not going to be enthralled by the hundred and first. Not only is the experience far from new or unique, he is unlikely to be the best or most attractive man she has had, since she was younger, more beautiful, and more innocent before, and could command the attention of a better variety of man. 

**Women are generally the most passionate about their first partner, and gradually less so with each new one. This is not their first rodeo.**



**Now we understand how these two male desires are NOT contradictory. They are actually the SAME desire... the desire to be both loved, and lusted after, passionately, utterly, and completely.**



When a woman has a high partner count, a man asks himself ""None of them kept her... why should I?"".

When a woman delays, withholds, and asks for promises or time, a man says ""She is cool-headed enough about me to negotiate. To enforce a policy. She regards sex with me as *a price to pay* for what she wants... not a joy she urgently desires.""

In fact, if a woman delays sex to avoid risk to her partner count, because a low count makes her more attractive, *just who* is this low count making her more attractive to?  

*It makes her more attractive to other men.* It does nothing for him. He of course expects to increase her count by one, because he wishes to be that one. If she hedges, then she is saying to him ""I don't want to risk being less sexy, or less commitment-worthy, to *the next guy*.""

She is already looking past him and the relationship hasn't even started yet. She is not ""all in"" with him, and he knows that. 

Why would he be committed to her, when she is not committed to him? 

*But what is a woman to do about all this? How can she be passionate, and unrestrained, with men, without destroying her value from an accumulation of failures?*

This, I will discuss in Part Two.

4db4ei,The Direction of RPW.,"As many of you may have noticed, some of our mods have quit recently. I wanted to address that here, and discuss a little bit about our direction.

First, I'd like to let everybody know, they left on their own accord, we didn't force anybody out. Second, I'd like to say that the sub will benefit greatly from this move. 

There are a lot of rumors going around as to why the mods left, and I wanted to clear that up so there's no confusion.

Ultimately it was a disagreement between them and me. 

When I founded this sub, I founded it on one of the main principles that guide every subreddit in the red pill network: Value truth above all else. There was even a small image in the corner that said ""It is better to be slapped with the truth than kissed by a lie.""

Unfortunately, the old mod team were not living up to this standard. Rather than embrace truth and encourage open discussion that has make the red pill network subs as popular and successful as they are, they decided that a small clique of women had the one and only strategy to happiness, and anybody who disagreed with them should be banned. That includes a lot of very good contributors, and women who had simply come here for help and understanding.

And by clique, I really mean it. Watching behind the scenes, it played out like the movie Mean Girls. The discussions that took place between myself and the mod team were less about facing hard truths, and instead about who was on who's side and who said what to whom. It was a cat fight. 

My original intention was not to disrupt the flow of this subreddit. I never disagreed with the clique on their strategy of marriage. It's a great goal to aspire towards for women. That said, there were some questions about the changing sexual landscape that were being censored. When honest discussion from a red pill perspective is being censored, that's when we knew we had trouble on our hands.

I did my best to appeal to the mod team, but at the end it didn't matter. They did not want to work with me towards the very goals this subreddit was founded upon, and it is my responsibility to the subscribers here to ensure that those principles stay in place.

Everything I feared in my introduction post ended up coming true:

&gt;The problem I've seen with female-based sexual strategy forums is that they inevitably focus on what's politically correct. They focus on tempering the message so as not to offend. Because ladies, like it or not, our entire culture currently revolves around not offending you. Seriously. That's today's culture.
This forum will embarce truth first and foremost, sensitivity be damned. While I encourage people to remain positive towards each other, plain insults are discouraged, I understand that sometimes the truth will seem like an insult.



**What's Not Changing**

We're not starting up a Red Pill men explain sub here, this is a sub for women and female sexual strategy. The moderation policy will always be focused on positive female sexual strategy.

The accusation that we want to encourage a ""plate school"" is nonsense. Men who come to push their agendas (to benefit themselves) will still find themselves kicked out.

Per my original announcement:

&gt;RedPillWomen is not the place for men to show up and spout nonsense. We have an unofficial rule on /r/theredpill that basically amounts to: don't listen to women about sexual strategy. It's not that we don't like women, it's that women really have a hard time seeing past what they like to understand men have a different palate. The same goes for men, perhaps even worse so. Men, being the less discriminating gender, are more-or-less programmed to find women sexy.. no matter what. And when a woman says, ""I like to eat pie with my fingers"" you'll have sex-thirsty guys line up out the door willing to say anything for female validation. ""I love women who eat with their fingers.""

**The goals**

Our goals will be identical to [my announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1giney/welcome_to_red_pill_women/) when we started. Finding long-term sexual strategies to maximize one's happiness and success. This hasn't changed. 

&gt;We had a radical idea- what if men and women learned about their natures and took proactive control of them, came up with a compromise that made both parties happier in the long run?

&gt;We're a cooperative species, and great things can be achieved when we do. Women, you have the ability to find happiness when you embrace the reality of your biological urges and impulses. You have the ability and the requirement to become the optimal mate for your optimal mate. Do not believe the hype that you are good enough how you are, and realize that in life, the only things worth having take work. That's for men and women.

&gt;RedPillWomen is self-improvement and long-term goal setting to maximize your personal happiness.

I'm saddened that things had to play out the way they did, but my responsibility remains to you, the subscribers. I apologize for letting you down, and we will not allow this same culture to take over again.

**For the next week**

We will be working on reinstating the sidebar and stylesheets, as the old team saw fit to try to destroy anything they could on their way out, claiming that it was ""theirs"" rather than the community's. 

We have a few RPW members who have stepped up and are committed to maintaining this vision. We are vetting the members now for the mod team. 

And discussion will continue, business as usual. 

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4db4ei/the_direction_of_rpw/,1459777497.0,93,0.89,150,RedPillWomen,redpillschool

4cbcsl,Do what he says.,"Hello, ladies.  I’ve been MIA for a while, super busy and just generally unable to sit down and type anything.  I want to check in and make a quick post about what I’ve been working on lately:  doing what he says.

It seems so basic – and it is  – but I’ve been finding it’s actually one of the hardest parts of being in an LTR.  The problem is that there are always multiple reasons to not do what he says:  you think he actually wants something else, someone else wants something different, your own judgment… and on and on it spins.  There’s a point where you should just stop thinking about that stuff and do what he freaking says.  

I’m not saying to just blindly follow orders.  Voice your concerns if you must, but in the end, please please please do what he says.  And if you really can’t do what he says because it’s horrifyingly against your morals or something, perhaps you shouldn’t be with that man.

Does he want you to wear that dress to dinner?  Wear it.  It doesn’t matter if you had something else in mind.  If it doesn’t match the weather, make it work – add a jacket or different shoes than you usually would wear.  He wants to see you in that dress – be his fantasy.

Does he want you to keep something secret?  Keep your mouth shut.  Will telling someone make you feel good?  Maybe.  Will it piss him off?  Definitely.  Take the definite.

Does he like your makeup a certain way?  Even if you think you look better a different way, who are you trying to attract?  Him.  So do it how he likes it.

Does he want you to stay away from a certain place/person?  Don’t go there.  He probably has a good reason.  

Did someone ask you to do something that goes against something he asked?  Don’t even try to compromise between the two, just say no.

There are so many ways to go wrong with this.  For example, my SO asked me to keep something secret.  A while later, I was hanging out with a friend.  She was in a situation that the secret was relevant to, and she was feeling pretty crappy about it, so I told her.  She felt so relieved, which was great!  But then my SO found out and he was pissed beyond belief.  In a moment of pity, I picked my friend over my SO.  If I just did what he said, she would have gotten over it and he would not be pissed off.  You can’t please everyone, so pick your SO.

You can also go very right with this.  I am in the middle of planning our wedding and my SO has a very specific request.  My entire family wants me to do this one thing differently.  I am indifferent to the way it’s done, and they both have good reasons to do it the way they want.  I was getting pressure from my family for months, until one day I started to argue with my mother over the phone and just flat out told her, “I can’t please everyone, so if I’m going to choose a side, I’m choosing my husband.”  After that, all nagging stopped.

tl;dr Do what he says and you’ll avoid a lot of grief.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/4cbcsl/do_what_he_says/,1459188675.0,65,0.85,37,RedPillWomen,TheLadyPainter

48f450,"From ""The Good Housekeeping Marriage Book"" published in 1938. There are some gems.","1. Did my husband start for work this morning in a better frame of mind for having married me, or would he have been happier as a single man or married to someone else? 
Remember, as you ask this question and apply your own answer, that we are talking about business; hard, practical business where intentions do not count. You may love your husband dearly, but if the results of your love are not constructive, you must write the word FAILURE across the record. 
2. Do I always treat my job just as seriously as if I were working in an office for a monthly salary? 
Some wives feel that it makes no difference if they linger so long over bridge or cocktails or shopping or whatever in the afternoon that they are unable to prepare a suitable meal for their husbands in the evening.
3. Have I grown in poise and interests like the wives of my husband's associates and superiors?
Wives who keep up with the procession are an asset; those who fail to grow are a liability.
4. Can I talk in the same terms as his associates and their wives? 
This indicates how carefully you have maintained your interest in the source of your income, and how accustomed you are to expressing yourself.
5. Do I dress and act like the wives of the business associates and superiors of my husband? 
You place a heavy handicap upon your effectiveness if your husband cannot be proud of you in the inevitable comparisons with other wives in his organization.
6. Do I entertain with reasonable frequency the people who are in a position to help my husband in business, or is our social life planned wholly for my own amusement? 
Perhaps this question should read, ""How long since I have entertained So-and-So?"" You may be surprised to find that months have slipped away without your having done a single stroke of good for your husband socially. 
7. Do I limit our social engagements during the week to those which will not take essential energy from the job, or do I feel that my husband ""owes"" me constant amusement when he is not actually at the office?
As employers pile responsibility upon your husband, more and more care must be used in the allocation of time to social affairs. You may be able to rest the next day, but business does not permit husbands to rest on the job. 
8. Do I act as a balance wheel, cheering him intelligently when he is tired or discouraged, or do I rub him the wrong way on such occasions?
 If your husband does not share with you his disappointments, it is almost invariably because you have not qualified yourself to share them. 
9. Do I try to smooth things out after unpleasant discussions—as I would if a new dress or theatre party were at stake? Many married persons have an uncanny capacity for making miserable the objects of their affection. It is said that the course of true love never did run smooth, but the wise husband or wife will not unnecessarily roughen it. 
10. Do I carry my share of responsibility, or do I save up all the petty annoyances for our dinner-table conversation? 
Wives who complain that their husbands are silent during dinner have usually good reason to overhaul the quality of their own conversation. Don't bore him with your fight with the grocer or the catty things Mrs. X said at bridge or afternoon tea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/48f450/from_the_good_housekeeping_marriage_book/,1456816837.0,80,0.98,10,RedPillWomen,iwishiwasamermaid

46fcnu,Sexual availability,"Now this is a touchy subject. How do we talk about sex without it being pornographic in nature and TMI? I’ve seen a few posts on here about *dead bedrooms* and *waning libidos* and this petulant attitude towards sex… BUT I DON’T WANNAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Boo *frickin’* hoo ladies.

Aside from medical reasons why you cannot have sex…. No. Wait. Fuck that… there should be no reason why you can’t please your man. If your vagina is broken, there are other ways to please a man…. Ahem… beej….ahem…butt….ahem…hands. So with that little disclaimer I will continue. 

What is the definition of a romantic relationship?

&gt;re·la·tion·ship /rəˈlāSH(ə)nˌSHip/ noun: the way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected, or the state of being connected.

&gt; ro·man·tic /rōˈman(t)ik/ adjective: conducive to or characterized by the expression of love.

So. You have two people being connected through expressions of love. What is one of the biggest expressions of love and trust? Sex. Making whoopee. Doing the horizontal mambo. Sure, sex can happen with anyone but there is no connection component to it. That is the line of demarcation. That singular component which makes sex into something beautiful and amazing. I told my daughter sex is not love, but sex is always amazing when done with someone you love. 

Here you are in a relationship with someone you love at this point. You’re feeling like the sex part is waning. You’re always tired from work. You don’t have the energy for it. You spend your days with the kids and you just want to sleep. I’m going to explain why you need to knock it off and also tips for knocking it off and being in your relationship….. romantically. 

**Being available all the time**

This is the toughest idea to get through to women. The idea that you should be available to please your man all the time. I’m not saying you need to rush home to blow your man in the middle of the work day because he needs it now (although that would be a good idea if your job allows for just leaving in the middle of the day lol). Don’t be ridiculous. I’m saying that when your man is flirting and signaling to you he wants you, you should really be all in. This man finds you sexually attractive? Can you blame him? You’re one hot chica! Own that. 

*Argument 1*

&gt; I shouldn’t have to have sex when I don’t want to. 

While this is true, this attitude is detrimental to a romantic relationship. You are signaling to your partner that you aren’t attracted to them and that you don’t need them for this type of intimacy. This type of thinking relegates your SO to being put in the ‘just anyone’ demographic. This removes their status of partner in your life and puts them in a position to be used when YOU want to use them. It makes it a one way street which is the antithesis of being in a relationship. 

*Argument 2*

&gt; I’m too tired from ::insert other things in your life::

One of the most important things to realize is that if you are in a relationship, it is work. It is a part of what you need to set aside energy for specifically in order to maintain it. If you put more effort into other portions of your life, do not be surprised when your relationship fails. Just like a garden, it must be tended to regularly. Is work what you fancy more than your partner? Is being a mom more important to you than the person you share your life with? (NOTICE: I did not say are your kids more important to you than your partner. Please note that I am not telling you to pick between them, however, you need to prioritize your position as a partner more than your position of being a mom. Your partner is there for life. Your kids are not.)

Putting life into perspective in terms of relationships can be hard. Is your partner really a priority to you? If not then you either need to next the SO you have because that is horse shit or you need to realize that maybe you just don’t really want to be in a relationship at this time. You are basically using someone to have a warm body next to you for fear of being alone. Wanting a career more than a relationship is fine, but you shouldn’t be imposing the loss of connection to someone else just because you don’t need it. 

*Argument 3*

&gt; My partners libido is too high/My libido is too low

Matching libidos is a huge issue in deadbedrooms. If you are a low libido person, then you should really be taking steps to mitigate that. There are plenty of ways in which you can overcome the low libido/high libido discrepancy. There was another post on there that I found really interesting that tl;dr says this 

&gt; If sex is not a priority to you, then you shouldn’t care if he goes out to find it somewhere else. 

Does that hit a sore spot with you? Then sex is a big deal to you. More than you allow yourself to feel. Maybe your body doesn’t comply but your brain just said “whoa whoa whoa CQ! Sex is important to me and I’ll be damned if my SO goes to get it from somewhere else”. Now that I have your attention. Listen up carefully. Sex is not just penis in vagina. I repeat. SEX IS NOT JUST PENIS IN VAGINA. So get that idea that out of your head right now. 


*Argument 4*

&gt;He is bad in bed/doesn’t last that long

This is trial and error. If you are not communicating to your partner the things you like then that is your fault. As someone who has a high N count, when you tell a man what you like they do that a lot. The ones who don’t are selfish not only in bed but in life and will never change and you should have figured that out during the vetting process to being with. 

**How to fix it**

With all of these in mind, I’m going to give you some pointers on how to overcome those arguments. I’m sure that there are other arguments but really they fall into those four categories. They just manifest themselves in other ways. 

*The perpetual flirt*

How do you communicate to your partner that you are sexually attracted to them? You show/tell them. All the time. Some of the things that you might do for this are the following. 

* Tell them something sexy at random times of the day.

* Wear something a bit sexy and flaunt your womanly goods. (ie bend at the waist not the knees)

* Sext him something you want to do to him 

* Make a lewd gesture when no one is looking

* Rub your body on them ‘accidentally’ with a teehee and a wink

The point is to be playful. Sex is natural. Sex is fun. (a la George Michael). Show him that you like/need/want his touch. Flirt. That costs you nothing. Not even energy. This will not only build him up but it will get you in the mood too. You will be thinking about it more and you will be more apt to be receptive to his advances. Not all sexual interactions have to finish in sex. They do have to demonstrate you want him…all the time. 

*”I’m feeling overwhelmed by ::other things in life::. What should I do?”*

With a lot of the issues, you find that your life is overwhelming you. He is your captain. Ask him what you should do about it. Maybe he tells you to cut back on your hours at work. Maybe he tells you to find a babysitter for the kids so you can practice self-care. Whatever it is, your captain can come up with something for you to be able to balance out your work/home life. He wants to be a priority in your life too so talking to him about it will allow for an opportunity to create more intimacy. So what if the dishes don’t get done asap? So what if you don’t cook one meal this week? Are these things worth it to sacrifice your relationship over? I doubt it. Tell him why you are too tired to do him and I am positive he will come up with a solution!

*Smack it down, flip it, rub it down oh noooooo*

Well this is where it gets a bit raunchy. I’ll try to tone it down as much as I can but really you can’t talk about the attitude of being sexually available without addressing some salacious aspects of it. Lube. Don’t be afraid to ask for it. Anal. Don’t be afraid to try it. (there is a training manual for this). Blowies. Don’t be afraid to get on your knees. Porn. Don’t be afraid to watch it. Costumes. Don’t be afraid to wear them. Sex doesn’t need to be all about you getting to the finish line. It is an act of intimacy between two people. Get sex toys. Do whatever you have to do in order to get there physically. With so much sex paraphernalia out there, you can figure out what you like and get some tools to help you get there.

No excuses. 

Lastly, if you have a captain who just simply does not give a shit about your well-being (ie demanding sex when you’re sick, goes in dry, doesn’t want to please you)… HE IS A SHITTY CAPTAIN. NEXT!

RPW works to correct certain structural attraction problems with normal to high dominance men.  it cant overcome drug addiction, alcoholism, mental illness, perennial low dominance weirdo-ness, or a host of other relationship issues (though it CAN help you *deal* with those things if you are married and make the conscious decision to stick your marriage out.)

41qmvl,The STFU Method,"Let’s start with a little joke ripped right from /r/jokes top of all-time list…

A woman goes to the Doctor, worried about her husband 's temper.

The Doctor asks: ""What's the problem?

The woman says: ""Doctor, I don't know what to do. Every day my husband seems to lose his temper for no 
reason. It scares me.""

The Doctor says: ""I have a cure for that. When it seems that your husband is getting angry, just take a glass of 
water and start swishing it in your mouth. Just swish and swish but don't swallow it until he either leaves the room or calms down.”

Two weeks later the woman comes back to the doctor looking fresh and reborn.

The woman says: ""Doctor that was a brilliant idea! Every time my husband started losing it, I swished with water. I swished and swished, and he calmed right down! How does a glass of water do that?""

The Doctor says: ""The water itself does nothing. It's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick"".

**The STFU Method**

The STFU Method ^TM is a handy way to create and keep peace in your daily life. More specifically it will enable you to have a more loving relationship with your SO. We would like to examine why, how and when it is applied while also dispelling the misconception that you are a doormat for doing so.

*Why do I need to STFU?*

The art of listening is an invaluable skill that can be useful in all areas of your life. We listen to friends when they have trouble, kids when they want to show something off, our parents when they have some wisdom to share, and a variety of other times in our lives. How it is applied to your current romantic relationship is detrimental in the success/failure of it. I’m sure we can all agree that if you don’t listen, you can never fully understand. This is exactly why we stress  on RPW to just STFU. 

While communicating your wants, needs, and feelings is important, listening is often *more* important in the health and welfare of your relationship. Understanding what is actually going on vs what you feel makes it easier to know what the next step is. Reflexively responding to situations is only good in fight or flight situations. In the beginning of learning how to listen, it is good to just take all the data presented and digest it before actually forming an opinion about it. Over time, you will find that you instinctively can discern the appropriate behaviors for specific situations without ever needing to voice anything. In the beginning however, it is important to just S T F U. Listen. Learn. Absorb. 

For new relationships, it is easy to STFU. You want to know how the person acts, what they think, what they like, and you want to please them. This is great and wonderful. The trick is when you have been in a relationship and the honeymoon phase is over, how do you keep that ability to listen and desire to please going? You see this guy at his worst and you are expected to still take him seriously? *GASPS* Seriously though, complacency is the killer of romance. So how do you prevent this? By listening to your partner. When you listen to your partner you are actively working on your relationship. You cannot expect a relationship to survive with minimal effort on your part. It just won’t happen. 

*How do I STFU*

This might seem like a no-brainer. Just close your mouth and all will be well. It can be a little bit trickier than that. STFU also means body language. Eye rolling is not you STFU’ing. Gasping with exasperations is you not STFU’ing. Pouting is you not STFU’ing. 

STFU is you actively and consciously removing yourself from a situation to better assess it. For those who are more practiced, it could very well be only keeping your mouth closed. However, for most of us self proclaimed strong willed bull headed women we may have to *smile* and *say “ok my love”* and **walk away**. These three small actions can make a big difference in your communication style. 

The first step I suggest is to smile. This is probably the hardest step because you want to rip someones head off when they say something you don’t like but the more you do this the easier it’ll become. Fake it til you make it! The first few times, your SO might look at you like *WTF is wrong with her?* but over time it’ll just be a positive way to signal that you need some time to process the interaction you just had. You could give mean stank face but what is that going to accomplish? Who does that really hurt? You because you’re the one going to be stuck with the wrinkles. LOL. So smile and breathe in.

Next is to state something agreeable. “Yes, my love” or “ok, honey” both give a positive affirmation and also reminds your SO that you love them with a term of endearment. You acquiesce to the situation and you do so graciously. This is to preserve intimacy and the closeness of the relationship. When has being a bitch ever gotten you anywhere? Never!

Most important step here. Walk away. Go do what was told to you or just go to the other room. You can let your hamster tire out away from your SO. **DO NOT GO BACK UNTIL YOUR HAMSTER IS PANTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST DEAD FROM RACING AROUND.** Take this time to process what just happened. What was said, how was it said, what did you feel, why did you feel that way, what was your SO trying to say. All of these things are your hamster at work. You can use this as an exercise in reigning it in and over time you should be doing this faster and faster. This is also the time when you realize if you ACTUALLY do have something to say to your SO. This is when you can actually tell whether you should bring up something because it was detrimental on his part to the relationship. However, if that is the case, you still want to do it with a calm, cool and relaxed demeanor so taking time away is always a good idea. 

Those are just my three steps. Most times, I just need to close my eyes and take a deep breath and can handle most situations. However, these three steps have always been fundamental in my growth. When a breathe isn’t enough, I walk away. If you find that you are walking away alllll the time, then there may be deeper issues with yourself at hand and those should be examined too. 

*When do I STFU*

While reading this, you may think that STFU only applies when your SO says something to you that hurts your feelings. However, this applies to a variety of feelings. Not just hurt ones. When you aren’t getting your way, when you think you know better, when you want to control things, when you want to dominate things, when you want something done in a certain way, when you want something done now, when you don’t want to do something now, when you want to hamster, when you don’t want to have sex, when you feel bossed around, when things just aren’t getting done and you want them done NOW!!!! Etc etc etc. 

Bossing, nagging, whining, bitching, complaining, griping, mothering, smothering, gumbling, belly-aching are alllllll times when you need to STFU. At times these things can be masked as coming from a good place. A gentle reminder every 10 minutes to take out the trash. A little push in the right direction because he has no clue what he is doing. A honey-do list a mile long. Sound familiar? 

Now go and STFU! Please let me know if I forgot anything.

3ydy5n,Improving/Skyrocketing your SMV outside your appearance: The Guide,"*note: This Guide is based mostly on reading TRP on a daily basis &amp; personal observation. I believe this is a decent guide for new Rpwomen also. If your do not understand a word click on it and it's going to explain the term for you via urban dictionary. Also, non-native english speaker but I am trying:).*

**Summary:** you can improve/skyrocket your [SMV](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SMV) outside your appearance, by observing qualities that lack in the general female population and aquiring them. 

**Introduction:** I read /r/TheRedPill on a daily basis and most men complain about the quality of 21st century women. Indoctrinated by feminism and mostly clueless about their role and biological engineering, today's women seem to embody ""qualities"" that men try avoiding at all cost. Let's see what men complain about:

* **Fat** - women today are getting fatter because it's not pollitically correct to promote eating less (it also damages economy. people must consume. a lot. ). Fat women artificially increase the SMV of thinner women and inflate their ego. 

* **Confrontational** - women are taught to put men (and other women) in their place and never let men step on their pride. This leads to a defensive and aggressive demeanor, which is off-putting  &amp; replaces feminine demeanor. 

* **Slutty** - this is a very easy one. RP women are aware of the [CC](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cock+carousel&amp;defid=7263482) and it's limited tickets (to nowhere). Most women are not aware. They believe casual sex is ""so cool"" and by sleeping with a lot of men they see it as a ""revenge"" on the opposite gender. *""You're using me for your pleasure? I'm using you, baby boy! Come here and show me what you're made of""* thinks the empowered woman. That is NOT attractive. 

* **Career-crazy** - If you're fat/slutty/confrontational or all of the above, it's no wonder your personal life is a mess. Your standards are high and your SMV low, so career becomes your main focus. You try filling the void by making career a priority thinking it's going to make you a successful woman

* **Entitled** - this is the main one I observed. Because we are born in a feminist climate, we are born entitled to EVERYTHING. I want to be equal to men, but pls open the door for me. I am very strong and independent, but I don't split the bill. I am a career woman, but I must conceive (biological clock) so let me engage in casual sex maybe somebody will commit. I deserve commitment even though I am not offering anything in return. Entitled to everything, the 21st century woman demands...demands...demands. 


**Body**: As RP Women we are aware how much of our value is based on appearance. Well, as long as you do everything in your power to look good, you're good. Maybe even with your efforts you don't feel competitive enough in the Social/Sexaul Marketplace. It doesn't matter, because there are some VERY important qualities which are in HIGH demand. Acquiring these qualities will skyrocket your SMV. **Beauty is rarity. There's no lack of beautiful women but there's a lack of feminine qualities and using this information wisely will make you extremely valuable, an asset to every quality man and to society.**

* **Thin** - This guide is not about appearance but I feel this needs to be said: Get thin the RP way! Men feel like we need to put so little work (compared to them) to look good. They must count calories, macros, lift, be disciplined, be long-term oriented. All we have to do to look good is eat less (or count calories). **That's it.**

* **Non - confrontational** - this is so rare these days. I feel like all women are just waiting to engage in a verbal-fight at any moment. This may not be true, but the tone in their voice, the lack of kindness in their words is an indicator to that. 
If your tone is  aggressive, make it honey-sweet. It works like a charm. I used to be a crazy/psycho aggressive girl when I was a teenager but your tone/attitude can be changed with practice. A girl watched too much [Bad Girls Club](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bad+Girls+Club&amp;defid=5778742) and wants to put you in your place? Don't step to that low-level behaviour. You are going to meet a lot of people who deserve to be put in their place, who are going to try stepping on you and so on. The trick is to CONTROL your impulses and not act on them. The prize will be so much better than letting off steam in the heat of the moment. Think royalty. Think of a high-status lady and how she would never engage in confrontational behavior. That's what you should be aiming for. **Because true ladies are very rare these days, this kind of  demeanour is very appreciated by men and will make them respect you and value you.**

* **Prude** - If your partner count is low and you never engaged in casual sex, this is not a problem for you. But sluttiness comes from more than a high partner count. It comes from the appearance of ""availability"" and ""easiness"". You can look easy by dressing trashy and drinking alcohol like a man. Swearing, shouting and attention-
seeking are also classic components of slutty behavior. Needless to say: DON'T DO THAT. Your aim should be to look pure and inocent - this means never engage in sexual conversations outside of your relationship *(Note: My boyfriend pointed out to me how his coworker (f) started a discussion about condoms as a sexual strategy to get in his pants)* , never be sexually-suggestive and don't showcase a dirty mind. **These are for your bedroom only**, and you know that. You'll stand out in the crowd like the most beautiful gem. 

* **Financially stable** - As a RPwoman you should aim for financial stability and a field of work which you are passionate about. A RPwoman is smart and knows that providing for yourself is an intelligent move, but she keeps balance. I read /r/RedPillWomen/ and I see a lot of discussions about how you should balance career &amp; personal life and this subreddit is a great resource for information. Keep in mind: **If you are impressed with a man's career achievements this does NOT means he is going to be impressed 
with yours**. It does not work like that, so never use career in your sexual strategy. 

* **Modest** - You are not entitled to anything. I quote from TRP ""Your purpose on this planet is to reproduce. You are NOT entitled to happiness, you do not deserve this or that. Be prepared to work for it but don't expect it or feel entitled to it"". I completly agree with this view. Don't inflate your ego. Set your boundaries and your
moral code and follow it. If a man does not provide you with what you feel you need, just leave. Do not make scenes about how you deserve this and that, do not expect him to love you and provide for you. Just keep working, improving yourself and be rational. TRP suggest women should lower standards, but I do not really agree with 
this. We (RPwomen) are a valuable asset to society by understanding our weaknesses and strengths. You should never lower standards as a Redpill woman as long as you are willing to WORK at your SMV. Realize you are not entitled to anything, but you are willing to WORK for everything. 


**A few mentions and tips:**
 
- On TRP a very common commentary is *""A man will see a mountain and try climbing to the top. A woman sees a mountain and declares that the top is where she is"".*An examples is the fat acceptance movement. Instead of working to be fit and beautiful, women declare their current look (fat, overweight, rolls) attractive. Is it attractive? It does NOT matter! THEY SAY SO! Don't be like that (I'm sure you aren't), just be willing to accept your flaws and improve.

- Keep your mental problems in check. No matter what tumblr says depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis etc ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE, romantic or intriguing. Present yourself as a perfectly sane person.
 
- Don't drink, don't do drugs! Personally I do not consume alcohol at all, but I suppose drinking a glass of wine will not compromise your lady-like image. Men loathe women who engage in drugs and binge drinking. This is simply too common, trashy and low-value. Just don't...

- Never be too radical in your views. Even if you own enough knowledge on a subject and a solid, strong opinion, the smart way is to keep it to yourself or share it with a pretty pretty... pretty  package. Tone it down. I used to be so radical in my (political) views and I looked like a complete psycho. I am very passionate about a lot of things and so are you, but let's not let our views spoil a good climate and ruin our feminine frame. 

**Conclusion:** Observe the marketplace and identify what it's lacking. Acquire qualities that other women seem to be oblivious to and skyrocket your SMV. Use your wits to be better. I read a thread on a forum once where men were discussing how unfeminine women are and how *""Even if she's a 5, if she's feminine she's an 8 to me""* . That's right. I read that even before knowing about TRP and it made so much sense. 
Study, observe, study, observe and never stop in your quest for becoming the best woman you can be.

3xn3s1,"13 Women Reveal How Much Their Engagement Ring Cost, And What It Means To Them","I found this article in another forum and thought that it would be interesting to post here: http://thoughtcatalog.com/daniel-hayes/2015/10/13-women-reveal-how-much-their-engagement-ring-cost-and-what-it-means-to-them/

Some of the responses were really sweet. It's nice to see that some of the women understood that the ring isn't necessarily significant--it's the fact that he wants you to be his wife which is significant. 

It was funny to read the entitlement and justification coming from a couple of these ladies. Why should the opinion of coworkers or friends matter about the cost of your ring? 

Like Janice said, drop the friends that critique your man's choice. And like Melody said, albeit much more bluntly, the size and cost of the rock isn't a measure of his love or loyalty for you.

His desire to choose you as his wife should matter more than the ring. The ring is a symbol of your union together. Take away the ring and you're still married, it's replaceable--your husband and your marriage are not.

It's not to say that one can't spend a considerable amount on an engagement or wedding ring. If he can afford it and it's his decision to spend that much on it, it's fine. 

But to expect him to spend a specific amount of money in order to keep up appearances or to *prove* that he really loves you? Lol okay, you go girl.

3wen4t,"Your man may just be laid back, not passive.","For those of you ladies who are new to RPW or just read The Surrendered Wife, I wanted to share something I have come to understand about my captain and men like him.  He is laid back and not overly controlling.  This used to frustrate me because how was I supposed to be submissive if he wasn't giving me specific orders and desires to submit to?  Why couldn't he just tell me what he wanted for dinner so I could submissively cook it for him?  Why wouldn't he decide what we should do on a Friday night so I could submissively go along with it?  Ohh, how frustrated I was getting.

Then I realized that there is a difference between being laid back and passive, and a difference between being controlling and in charge.  The problem is never that my man is willing to eat whatever I feel inspired to cook without his input, or that he is happy to delight me by considering whatever would make me happy on a Friday night.  There certainly would be a problem that comes from ME if he did express a preference and I did not defer to it.  But absent of that, there is no problem in our relationship dynamic unless I create one, which is entirely possible if you consider how emasculating and demoralizing it is when a man gets criticized by his woman for not being more decisive.  Getting frustrated with your man for being laid back (and therefore ""not manly enough"") is going to undermine the very thing you're after, and it's very disrespectful to him anyway.

Instead of getting frustrated when he is willing to go along with whatever you decide, THANK HIM.  Thank him for allowing you to do whatever makes your little heart happy.  Seeing his indifference towards decisions like these in a frustrating light just means YOU ARE PERPETUATING THE POWER STRUGGLE, and a sign that you have so much more letting go to do.  This work is on you, not him.

In other words, don't try to subtly (or not so subtly) dominate him into being more dominant.  Your job is not to teach him how to be a better man.  Make yourself a better woman and leave him alone.  Accept that you have an awesomely laid back man and be sure to defer to him when he does have an idea, plan, or preference.

3w94qc,Thank You vs. Sorry,"http://brightside.me/article/stop-saying-sorry-if-you-want-to-say-thank-you-a-seriously-insightful-cartoon-57255/

I came across this on another subreddit. I think it's very easy to fall on the ""sorry"" path when you've taken the pill and you're actively working on changing bad behaviors, but you're not exactly there yet. 


The comic illustrates some ways you can change the tone of the message, from being negative and about you, to positive and taking into account the other person. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, if I say sorry I even get rewarded with a compliment-- It's still all about me. I found this comment made a good point:


&gt; I think the point is not to focus on our feelings, but on the other person's. If I feel badly for what I did, I'm focusing on myself rather than taking the other person's feelings into consideration. I can acknowledge them putting up with me best by saying thank you. Otherwise I'm just inviting pity, and hoping they'll dismiss my behavior or make an excuse for me: ""That's OK,"" or, ""No, you're not late! I just got here myself!"" What about saying something like, "" I am sorry I'm late. Thank you for being so patient!"" That way, I'm not excusing my behavior; I'm apologizing for it. But I'm also not keeping the spotlight on myself.

3vwoev,"""I'm so glad we're not like them.""","I just wanted to share a small victory that I can't think of anywhere else appropriate to share. 

My husband and I have been together for 12 years (since I was 19!), married for 6. When we met I was at the beginning of my college education with plans to become a lawyer, but my heart wasn't totally in it. I wanted, more than anything, to be a wife and partner, but the current state of American society made me feel like this wasn't enough and I needed to be ashamed of the fact that it didn't make money. I think I've carried this shame with me to some small extent until very recently. 

When I met my husband I knew right off the bat that he was brilliant, and could change the world. His job takes him all around the world, consulting where he is needed. This, obviously, is not compatible with being a lawyer, but I knew in my heart of hearts I would much rather be his best friend, support system, creating a home life for him wherever we landed, and serving as his confidant then spend my days doing legal paper work for other people. I knew this immediately, but still, it was important to us both that I have options, so I finished my education, graduated at the top of my class, then decided to marry him. With that came moving to a new state (sometimes a new country) every year or so... It's hard, like really hard, but I couldn't have ever asked for as much joy as I've had in life, and it's still early!

Even with all that, I carried with me this nagging feeling that I wasn't contributing enough and needed to feel bad about not having a ""career."" Is helper really enough?

Last week we had dinner with one of his best friends in the same profession. He's in a serious relationship with a very nice Biology professor, and they spend 6-8 months a year apart. Still, they are a lovely, if unstable, couple, and as we left dinner with them I felt that old insecurity over my lack of profession rearing... 

Until my husband looked over at me and said ""I'm glad we're not like them, it never would have worked. I'm so blessed that you chose to be by my side rather than chasing your own interests.""

You guys, I melted. It's all worth it. Stay the course. A lot of people have a lot ideas, but that doesn't matter one bit. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3vwoev/im_so_glad_were_not_like_them/,1449563738.0,77,0.91,44,RedPillWomen,SkylarWyte

Here's the thing about RPW.  Yes, we have lots of theories about a lot of things regarding sexual strategy.  Quite frankly, we don't really care if you believe any of it, all of it, or none of it.

3k4fa3,"""You are replaceable. Don't forget it.""","This is exactly what my partner told me last night. And while he wasn't saying it directly at me, I have to admit that it stung quite a bit because I took it personally. But once I got over my feelings of entitlement, it actually got me thinking about what it means to be replaceable. 

We are all replaceable to someone. Even as basic members of society, we are replaceable. Most of us will live for 80+ years and then die. The future generation will replace the current one. So on and so forth. 

While it's easy to think of being replaceable in terms of the big picture (i.e., society), it's a lot harder to think of it when you're dealing with intimate relationships. There are these funny things called emotions that bond us to certain people and sometimes we forget our role within the relationship. What starts out as a two-way, mutually beneficial setup can easily become a one-way street to misery that we either resign ourselves to or ""upgrade"" (but really, rinse and repeat). Unfortunately, this has become commonplace with some women even when we don't think we're doing it. We slack off here and there, we gain a little weight (or a lot), we prioritize differently now than a few years ago, etc. And we expect our partners to put up with this. For some relationships, our partners DO put up with this. I've witnessed it in my own social circle and in various other social circles. Why do we do this though? When we start out in relationships, we want to present our best possible self in order to attract/keep the man. So why don't we want to continue to do that 10 or 20 years down the line? 

When I first thought of myself as being replaceable, I thought of it in a very negative way. I like feeling special to my partner and feeling replaceable takes away those feelings. It makes you think, ""What's the point?"". However, I have learned to replace those thoughts with these: My partner is not obligated to be with me. He CHOOSES to be with me of his own free will. Gratitude for that is not out of desperation, but out of humility. I do not think I'm entitled to my partner's love or care or material goods, but I graciously accept and appreciate that he chooses to share those things with me. And because I keep that frame of mind, I am filled with the genuine desire to want to be my best possible self for him. He could still replace me if he wanted, so this doesn't come from a place of fear or manipulation which I think is a common misconception. I could be everything he wanted and he could still say ""No"", just as I could be a nagging harpy and he could still say ""No"". So trying to argue that this mindset comes from fear/manipulation is really just a moot point.

We are all replaceable. We should never forget that, in general, others are not obligated to us. We are not special snowflakes and we do not deserve special treatment. Keep abundance mentality in mind, appreciate that your partner chose you, and continue to bring your A-game. Don't get hung up on the details or the little things. Most men are very simple, straightforward creatures. A lot of the ""drama"" that women blame men for is really what we create out of nothing. When you keep things simple for yourself, you keep things simple for him. And he'll love you for it.

3jnove,Surrendered Wife - 4 months in and unbelievable improvements,"I happened upon the red pill life back in January of this year. I was looking for ways to improve my new marriage by getting back to traditional values and was trying to research ways when a link popped up concerning red pill. Eventually I found my way here and became obsessed. My old ways were mostly easy to give up - or so I thought. I adopted the red pill woman mentality relatively easily. When I read The Surrendered Wife and tried to implement Laura's ideas, I hit some road blocks. 

I would literally have to trust my husband with everything; our livelihood, multiple decisions about family and money, stuff I knew based on our two year relationship, he couldn't do. He forgets literally everything I tell him, even if it's multiple times. One weekend I had to work and the kids wore the same underwear two days in a row! I fell apart, came here to try and get my questions answered on how to fix my husband and make him an alpha - and had my ass torn apart and handed back to me. I almost gave up the whole red pill idea right then. But one poster in particular (I'll always remember her!) said something that clicked and it as something to the effect of I was only fooling myself into thinking I had surrendered but by the way I told my story it was obvious to red pill women I had not. 

So I tried again. Things honestly couldn't get worse for my husband and I unless he was to lose his job. We rent a place from his parents, drive cars that are over 10 years old and are financially quite poor and over burdened. So I thought, ""what the hell? Things truly can't get much worse"" and I just let my husband have it all. Do you know what? I have never been more happy to be so completely wrong about something in my whole life!!!!!!

What a burden has been lifted off my shoulders to not handle the finances anymore! He's stepped up, created a budget, he gives me a budget I can stick to and as long as I'm under it I know we have money. He goes after sales bonuses like a lion after prey because he now sees the money in our account directly - I haven't looked at our bank account in months! Just recently my husband needed to replace his car and we had money saved because he had begun a car fund. He was talking up a real storm about a car I was worried would cost too much  in upkeep and insurance and isn't practical for our family - do you know he gave up on that car himself?! He asked me my opinion on the car and I was DYING to give it to him but instead I did as Mrs. Doyle instructed and replied ""whatever you think."" He instead changed his mind and bought a 4 door sedan and actually came in under budget! And our insurance dropped $25 a month! The change has been incredible! 

The best part is that my husband noticed my changes and thanked me the other day. ""I've never felt more in charge of my own life or family and I've never felt more like a man in any relationship."" That's what he said to me. I'll always be red pill and always be a surrendered wife. It truly does work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3jnove/surrendered_wife_4_months_in_and_unbelievable/,1441395300.0,104,0.93,14,RedPillWomen,[deleted]
3jbgul,Showing appreciation to men in general :),"I feel like most men don't get enough appreciation in today's feminist world, so I try to make an effort to do my part to counter-act that.

Here are some random examples:

- I was at a grocery store, and my line's bagger got called away.  The male cashier said something, I forget what, but it was apologetic.  I responded that it was ok, he was just obviously such a capable guy that he could manage the whole process himself.  He said that was the nicest thing anybody had said to him all week!

- There's a place I walk often that is a bit damaged, and makes being there tedious/slightly more dangerous.  Today, it finally got repaired!  I was around when the crew were, and I told them that, even though they didn't get to pick where they did repairs, I really appreciated what they were doing, and thanked them.  They seemed rather pleased :)

Those are just a couple of examples off the top of my head.  But I think it's useful, on a personal level and a societal level, to go out and counteract the negative messages men get.  I'd love to hear other people's examples!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3jbgul/showing_appreciation_to_men_in_general/,1441170182.0,53,0.87,16,RedPillWomen,Lilia42

3inq08,Thank you RPW. I am now engaged and have you ladies to thank for it,"Yesterday my boyfriend of 9 months proposed to me. I know without the support of this forum this would never have happened.  

I began reading RPW about 2 years ago, at that time I was a wreck emotionally because I was a feminist and surprisingly no men took interest in me. Also, I had very few skills and interests, which left me unfulfilled. I found this forum and despite it being the epitome of what I resented in terms of women's roles and such, I knew something had to change so despite hating half of the harsh truths I saw here, I decided to follow the advice. I was 40lbs overweight, had a terrible wardrobe, and had a dyed very short ugly haircut.  

I was told first to lose the excess weight and I began to really find a degree of happiness and fulfillment from exercising. I started lifting weights and running and over time the flab at my butt and belly dissapeared and became more toned which made me really proud. Instead of being somewhat self loathing I really began to have a degree of self contentment, and exercise is something which to this day makes me very happy and keeps me feeling healthy.  
 

I then had to get a better wardrobe. When I say bad wardrobe, I'm talking basketball shorts, lots of baggy jeans, basically terrible terrible fashion. I bought a new wardrobe mostly comprised of dresses, skirts, some nice blouses, and the few pants I got were more elegant/slender pants and yoga pants for being home alone in winter (I'm from Chicago and its very cold here). The clothes I got admittedly weren't great brands but they looked decent and were what I could afford at the time. Needless to say they were a massive improvement.  

And then came the hair...the hair was the last to do. I had blue dyed hair, which at the time I thought was very ""individual"". Needless to say I looked like a trainwreck. I viewed short hair as a kind of rebellion against society to some degree, but I just let my hair grow longer and longer into a more feminine length. Finally I went to a haircut place and got that blue mess sheared off. I thought I was fairly good looking at that point so I started going on online dates.  

Most of them were pretty uncomfortable, I didn't really like the guys. They seemed like 'beta' guys as you ladies say. Then I met this guy, my current fiance who really blew me away. He was nice dressed, handsome. He also initiated the conversation, and I got a lot of subtle clues he was pretty masculine. For example he asked me what I wanted and then when the waiter came over he ordered for me and said 'she's having blah blah blah"", which really caught my notice. He paid for the meal and held the door for me and took me on a walk afterward. When we were walking he put his hand on my back and kind of guided me it was so sweet, the whole date was  really romantic and I fell for him. We'd been dating since then and going on outings together. Anyway, yesterday he proposed to me and of course I accepted. I could never have even caught his eye without your help, much less married him. A million thank yous to you lovely oppressive women",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3inq08/thank_you_rpw_i_am_now_engaged_and_have_you/,1440716652.0,88,0.93,20,RedPillWomen,Gojogojo
3imcyh,"A thank you of sorts, or recovering from a ""feminist"" marriage","I made a post here a long time ago that I unfortunately cannot find now. I had found RP a few weeks before. I considered myself feminist. First, I was angry. Then I realized the more I read this sub, the more things made sense. I posted because I was worried about my marriage. I could not figure out how to get my husband to take the lead. I had been the type of woman who was proud to make more money than my husband. I would brag that my job was high pressure and that I didn't have time to do domestic things. He had settled for a terrible job that totally demoralized him and he lost all ambition to do better with me taking the role of the breadwinner. We stopped having sex. We would go out to eat and I would always pay because I'd tell him he couldn't afford to pay for dates. I fell into a mother role where I would constantly nag him. All he did was play video games. When I posted, the vast majority of the ladies who responded said I had basically ruined my marriage and that it was over. I was angry. I tried to forget about RPW.

Then something amazing happened. My husband lost his job. In the past I had expressed that I thought if he lost his job, he would simply stay unemployed because he was so unambitious. But the moment he told me he lost his job, something clicked. This was our opportunity. I immediately told him that I couldn't wait to see how he would do in his next job, that this was great news and it was time for us to make a change anyway. I *didn't* suggest that I would support us on my salary alone(which I had always said in the past). The first few days were really hard. He had a hard time looking for a job. But I gently made suggestions and then pulled back, and eventually he came to me with ideas, thoughts on what his next steps were, etc. I was unequivocally supportive. I told him how smart and capable he was and that I knew he would be able to get any job he wanted. Every time he went to a job interview, I told him how proud I was and made sure to shower him with physical affection that I had withheld for so long. He works in a very in demand field, and within two to three weeks he had a job for double his previous salary. 

We went out and he bought all new clothes -- dress shirts, nice pants, etc. His wardrobe had become basketball shorts and video game t-shirts prior to this. I started ironing his clothes for him before work. I felt the urge to complain, and I didn't. I would make sure he had food to take to work, which I ""didn't have time"" to do before because I was so busy with *my* job. Within two months, he had gotten a raise. He was excelling at his job, and his confidence was through the roof. I gave him all the support I could at home to make sure he only had to worry about his success, as he had lost many potential career advancement years while we were stuck in a rut.

Anyway, this has been stressful at times but I had kind of naturally fallen into this better pattern and did not really think of RPW again until recently. I was passed over for a promotion, in favor of a male colleague. I was very hurt and upset. I worked harder than him. I'd been on the team longer than him. Then I stopped and thought, ""I have worked so hard, sometimes at the expense of neglecting my husband, and where has it gotten me?"" I pulled back from work. I stopped checking my email outside of work hours. I stopped being available for every emergency. 

I put more of my focus into my marriage and self improvement. I exercise almost every day. I dress better. I clean more often. I make sure we always have food prepared, I'm always trying new recipes and making sure his favorite foods are onhand. What prompted this post is that I found myself ironing our sheets before work today, and I felt happy. It was almost meditative. I had always enjoyed ""domestic"" activities before, but I felt ashamed of it and like I had to be a strong woman who could support herself and didn't have time for frivolous things. Here I am now, giddy at the thought of my husband coming home and seeing our bed made up with our new mattress, sheets, and pillows that I set up while he is at work. I can honestly say I have never in my adult life been happier.

These are some of the things that have happened:

* Our sex life has improved immeasurably. I stopped treating him like he was a monster for wanting me. I would snap at him all the time before when he wanted sex. Now even if I am not in the mood, I am open to it. But I find myself in the mood MUCH more often anyway due to the improvement in our marriage.
* He has expressed pride multiple times in the things I do for him. For example, he told me when people compliment his shirts he thinks about how I always make sure they are ironed and ready for him. I feel so happy when he tells me this. Knowing that the things I do for him are present throughout his day and make him think of me is very gratifying. There was no equivalent to this feeling before when I was the ""breadwinner.""
* He takes me out on dates. He's taken me shopping. I can enjoy these things guilt free without complaining that he can't afford it. It feels so good to get dressed up and be treated by my man. We hadn't done this since pretty much the first year we were dating. 
* I feel so much more attracted to him. He dresses nicely even on the weekends now. Basketball shorts are no longer regular attire. This also motivates me to dress more nicely. When we walk into a restaurant or a party, I feel a sense of pride and feel good about our image as a couple. I'm sorry if that sounds shallow. But I used to want to disapper, I felt bad about myself and about him.
* I make time to exercise and take care of myself now. I'm running a 5k for the first time in a couple of weeks. I feel awesome! My husband tells me all the time how proud he is of me for sticking to my running routine.
* We almost never fight anymore. This is the big one. Before we would fight almost every day, to the point that I started to avoid interacting with him. I was so lonely I would just lay in bed and cry, feeling like I was so far away from my husband and that we couldn't interact without being ugly towards each other.
* With stress from the marriage gone, home has become a place where he can retreat from a stressful day. In the past, during really bad fights, he stated he didn't even want to come home because I just stressed him out. The difference is night and day. Now I am the place he retreats after a hard day.
* Edited to add a major one I forgot: I had always said I was childfree. Now with the stress of overworking myself gone, and with our marriage being in such a better place for almost a year now, I actually feel open to having kids. We have already had talks about it and are planning our travel over the next year or two so we can get our pre-kids bucket list done and then get started. I actually... feel happy about the idea of being a mom, which was a totally foreign concept to me, but I feel even more excited to see my husband be a dad. When I see him with our niece I just picture our kids and how wonderful he would be with them.

There are other changes I'm sure I'm missing and this is already a little bit rambly, but just overall my marriage is amazing now. It's everything I wanted. And I know he is so much happier too, because he has said so more than once. I never would have thought this was possible, but it's like RPW planted the seed I needed to make these changes and I was able to undo years of nagging, abrasive interactions. When we disagree on something now(something that doesn't matter to our marriage, like our opinion on something political that doesn't affect us), I gracefully change the subject, where before I would hammer my opinions into his head. I would rather be happy with my husband than be right.

Anyway, my reason for posting this is two-fold. First, as a thank you to this community for giving me the ideas that helped me steer my marriage in the right direction. Second, for any other feminists out there who lurk here and like me have molded their personalities to what we are so often pressured to be, which is essentially to act like a man. If you are having doubts, take some of the advice from this sub and apply it to your relationship. It can't hurt. You're not compromising yourself. You're not betraying other women. You're not being shallow. You are not a ""bad feminist."" This was a big concern for me at first. But in the end, you have to do what is right for you. You can believe in equality and accept that things work better for you when you fall into a certain role. It's okay to reject the current wave of feminism that encourage promiscuity and having 1000 partners(I feel embarrassed when I think about fights I had with my husband because he was ""slut shaming"" someone, when he was just observing destructive behavior). It's okay to do things to help your marriage, and there is hope even in situations that are seemingly not salvageable... my marriage is proof of that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3imcyh/a_thank_you_of_sorts_or_recovering_from_a/,1440695766.0,90,0.91,28,RedPillWomen,rpwhelped
3hqc9t,Love your husband HIS way.,"[100 ways you can love your husband his way.](http://marriagemissions.com/100-ways-you-can-love-your-husband-his-way/) 


This is an excellent list of behaviors for an excellent wife to exhibit. It's a marriagemissions.com piece, so there are a couple about prayer, but obviously disregard them if it's not your thing. It's almost impossible to find quality advice for young married women in secular media, so I don't wan to alienate any of you guys with this, it really is a great list for a submissive wife. Good and basic, and refreshing to know there's an audience for the info on how to please a man according to what he wants. It's gently worded and applicable to all ages, not just newly married young women. 

The hundred points here are good stuff. There are many points which talk about respecting his dignity and his reputation. NEVER slander your man, NEVER join in on all the husband bashing that wives love to engage in. I'm sure you've all seen and heard it, isn't it shocking? In his presence, behind his back, always build him up. One of the most important things you can do is just build him up. 

They also have a few in here about keeping your body in shape and dressing in a way to attract his attention, but not skank it up in public. Dress in a way that makes him proud you're his wife. Being attractive, not being fat, and getting dressed in a way where you keep his eyes on you is #1. 

And several more were about giving him ample space and time alone. Of course he doesn't want to be smothered. But if you're with an alpha hottie it's hard not to want to be on top of him all the time. (Guilty.) His attention is valuable to you if he's a high value man. So yeah, give him a breather. 

Number 98 is very cute, I'm going to do it this week. 


So just a nice, basic list. What do you think? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3hqc9t/love_your_husband_his_way/,1440085764.0,56,0.91,11,RedPillWomen,Disappear_vanish
3hbz82,Self-Care Megathread,"Hi all,

Medium-time lurker here. I found this sub a bit ago and despite it being quite contrary to much of what I thought I believed and knew...well I've read every post since then and at least 7 pages of the top posts of all time and pretty much immediately purchased ""Surrendered Single"" and read it in a day. So, there's something here. Anyway this is my first post and I just made this account for the exclusive use of RPW (at the behest of a post I found). 

While I could not in earnest describe myself as RP (yet?), I wanted to contribute a bit of what I do believe I have locked down. You all place such a high priority on self-care which, BP or RP or other, is something I have learned to place an absolute premium on in the past 2 years and really sets me apart from my friends. To the point where, some of them aren't much of friends anymore. Call it judgmental but it just kills me to see them place no value on their health or long term well being and just *accepting* reality as whatever is easiest. 

Anyway, self-care has proved to be a snowball effect. It started with the gym, but the principles of respecting my body have eked into more places and more places. I started out overweight after literally never exercising in my life (other than the yearly ""I'm going to really do it this time!"" 1-3 days of half-heartedly sprinting til I died and doing crunches -- anyone else relate?) and now I'm in incredibly good shape. No fitness model for sure but I'd say upper 80-85% of the general population (and that may be less of a compliment to myself and more a low bar set by the general population). My skin is beautiful for the first time since youth and people (particularly women) comment on my teeth quite regularly (I don't even use whitening strips). I just *feel* great. I feel proud. And that was something I was used to not feeling. I don't have it all figured out, and hopefully you ladies can chime in with your tips and tricks as well, but here are some things I think many of us could benefit from. 

Without further ado:

**General**

* When it comes to all these things, my first motto is 'motivation is doing what you have to do, when you have to do it, because you want to do it; determination is doing what you have to do, when you have to do it, even when you don't want to do it.' Don't trust motivation. It's a wonderful feeling and it's amazing to feel so driven but if that's your primary vehicle for reaching your goals..you're going to run out of gas. Once you accept, in your heart of hearts, these things (particularly the loathsome gym visits) are a part of your day and you can't change it...you stop dreading it anymore. Dread comes from some part of you acknowledging, even in the tiniest percentage, that it's optional. It's not optional and you can't change the weather either. 

* My second motto is ""consistency beats intensity"". I think that speaks for itself, but don't beat yourself up for slip ups -- just keep swimming. 

**Fitness**

The thing that blows my mind about exercise is how *not obvious* it is. I know the majority of times I gave up was because I truly didn't know what I was doing and it feels overwhelming. Figuring it all out takes longer than I could say in this post (as if I've figured it all out...) but maybe you can skip some of the initial horribleness.

* First off, you should really enjoy it, where possible. It won't be all daisies all the time and I think it's good to subject yourself to unpleasantries in the name of the greater good, but at the same time you shouldn't hate it from start to finish. If you hate running, don't run. I began exclusively lifting weights for this reason. All I had done previously was lug my fat butt around the treadmill for a while and loathed it. Weight lifting is a great place to start. I suggest looking into Starting Strength, Brett Contreras 'Glute Goddess' routine, or even a standard 'bro split' (sorting the body into each muscle group and doing one group each day). It was extremely helpful to me to 1. Be doing a workout I enjoyed, and 2. Not going to the gym with any question as to what was happening that day. 

* If weightlifting is also not for you, I love rock climbing. As soon as I'm settled with a job I plan on getting a membership. It's an odd one that doesn't come to mind, but it's so much fun and really a great workout. Also observing your progress is straight forward and I think people underrate how important it is to watch yourself improve at a skill. It means a lot of good things for your whole frame of mind. Yoga is another obvious one. I also enjoy swimming though I haven't done it in far too long. Oh! Pole dancing. Love it. Could not recommend it enough -- it really is a beyond killer workout, it's also a great place to be around exclusively females, and if you enjoy it enough to bring it home with you the poles are shockingly affordable and I don't doubt any Captain would love a good show. If anyone does this please let me know!  Beyond those suggestions there are also adult league sports.

* Commit to your routine. If you can go 5/6 days a week...that is best. To me 5/6 days a week for 1-1.5 hours a day is the ideal. I've been doing that for the better part of 2 years, it means a lot to me and I couldn't do without it. Commit yourself to what you're doing and soon you'll need your gym fix. If that's a bit much then I think the minimum is 4 days. I personally love giving myself 4 out of 5 days or 5 out of 6 days of intense workouts, and then the last day I'll walk for 6 miles (about 90 minutes). It's a really relaxing time for me and often the only time all week I allow any TV.  It's a reward I really look forward to. 

* For me, morning workout is best. I like to wake up at 4:45-5:30 and just get it done before anything else. It sucks at first, but I like to do it before I have time to overthink it and it does wonders for my energy and state of mind all day. I feel productive and proud and everything after that comes easier. 

* Also, start a workout notebook. Whatever your chosen exercise/sport/routine is-- log everything you can. I'm partial to Moleskin's calendar with the days of the week expressed vertically on lined paper, it's about the size of an index card and I keep it in my workout pack. I attribute much of my success to having a good system of accountability. It saves me time knowing how to improve from the week prior, and any day I don't exercise gets a big X. I've only twice missed more than a week, but each day I took the time to draw 7 big X's. Keep yourself honest. And now I have a collection of books that are a real source of pride for me. They help me not forget how far I've come when I get hard on myself. 

* Finally, do try not to be too hard on yourself. I went from a complacent chubby girl to the most self-critical one with a pretty rocking physique (though it usually doesn't feel that way). In my head I know there was a time where I would have slaughtered someone to look how I do know (though it never occurred to me that I didn't need to slaughter anyone, I could just...go to the gym), and now it sometimes feels nothing is good enough. I suppose it's the double-edged sword of self-improvement, but do what you can to celebrate your accomplishments. You deserve it!

(I know I've gone a mile wide and an inch deep on this post and have possibly blabbed too much, but if anyone wants more in-depth information -- routines, advice, etc -- PM me. I'm really passionate about helping people do what always seemed just out of reach because I spent many many years feeling the same and it's just nice to have resources)

**Food**

I swear I'll keep this section shorter, also you ladies cook a lot and I wouldn't be so condescending as to give you instructions on how to boil water. 

Just a couple rules I try and follow:

* On the food you purchase, the ingredients label should look like a recipe and not a science project. If you wouldn't keep sodium nitrate in your pantry, you don't need it in your chicken. 

* When ordering a salad out, dressing on the side. Restaurant dressings are often filled with more useless sugars and unhealthy fats than if you had just got the burger. Where possible, order a straight olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  

* Sugar is the devil. Some people process it better than others (from a purely aesthetic point of view), but frankly I would call it the worst thing for you in terms of health. Fruits and such are fine, but refined and processed sugars. Avoid. In all honesty, it's my greatest addiction and while I have it controlled, I don't have as much advice to offer as I'd like. I'd certainly be open to any tactics you all may have. 

* I highly recommend the book 'Thinside Out: Have your cake and skinny jeans too'. Being healthy and being obsessive compulsive can be a fine line that I am guilty of crossing to the wrong side of. Calorie trackers can be helpful or harmful. Weighing yourself can be helpful or harmful. I have helped and harmed with just about every tool given to me. This book is well-written and an easy read and it does a lot for me about breaking down the psychology of poor eating habits and emphasizing balance above all else. 

* For regular meals, I try and stick to things that live or grow (aka meat or veggies) and their 2nd or 3rd degree byproducts (aka yogurt, eggs, bread). Once you get beyond those (cereals, meal replacements) it's mostly crap with few exceptions. 

* I am not the master dietician or nutritionist -- I strongly encourage your own eating tips in the comments because these things are my passion and as a group that does prioritize self-care the way you do...I'm all ears!

**Skin**

* /r/skincareaddiction is a fabulous resource, but here is my overview that's quite simplified and has done me **oodles** of good. 

* Keep it simple. Don't get a gimmick cleanser, Cetaphil or CeraVe are 2 good brands to start with. Only use your finger tips. **Never** scrub with a wash cloth (just stopping that cleared my skin up so much). If your skin feels dry and tight after washing, that isn't clean --  that's your skin stripped of oils and it's bad. I like a light cleansing in the morning and a more thorough one at night. Though just one at night and a splash of water in the AM may be good for you. 

* Moisturizer. Always moisturizer, if you have dry skin - moisturize. If you have oily skin, it's likely your skin overcompensating for dehydration - moisturize. I like CeraVe in the tub. Any time you cleanse, moisturize right after. 

* Sunscreen, wear it every day, and thank me in 20 years (many of you do this but it can really never be said enough). Also, make sure you're wearing enough. I believe the suggested amount is 1/4tsp (which seems like a lot) but that's how it's intended. 

* THIS MAY BE YOUR WHOLE SKINCARE ROUTINE. Cleanse and moisturize + SPF. Be gentle with your skin and that may do more for it than anything else. Less is more sounds shocking and contrary to every grapefruit, walnut core exfoliation, blah blah commercial -- but true. 

* Tea Tree Oil is great for spot control on budding pimples, be sure to dilute it though. I'll say: just doing the above for about 2 weeks only -- I bought tea tree oil and came home to try it...didn't have a single pimple to test it on. For my skin, that's crazy. I couldn't believe it. Most irrational disappointment beer, but true. I got to try it the next day though (of course), and it stopped that bad boy in its tracks. Tickle me impressed. I bought mine for $6.99 at Trader Joe's. 

* If you must exfoliate (which I must to get rid of those nasty little bumps), look into an AHA or BHA chemical exfoliant. They are much more gentle and uniform than physical scrubs. I'm not there yet, but quite looking forward to it. 

* Why am I not there yet? *Wait a minimum of 1 week in between start products*. It's really hard taking crap care of your skin, researching how to take better care of it, and not being able to do that all at once. Introduce one product at a time and change nothing else about what you already do. If you use everything at once and break out...you won't know what caused it and back to square one. I'm starting a new sunscreen this week and then a BHA next week. I'm really excited and have high hopes...but patience. 

* Non-facial care: AmLactin Lotion -- *omg*. It's a body lotion with the most gentle AHA chemical exfoliant in it. I use it on my body post-shower and I never believed my skin could be so smooth and beautiful. If you have any red bumps...run to Target and buy some now. It's very basic (and with skin care, basic is usually best -- keep it simple) and I love it. I've never had visibly pretty leg skin before (which is a curse after all the good exercise has done them) and now I couldn't be more enthused about wearing dresses. Note: it's a bit stinky, it doesn't bother me for too long but I warned you!

**Dental Care**

* You only have to floss the teeth you want to keep. 

* Seriously this section is the most straight forward: brush your teeth twice a day, floss every day, and after you floss rinse with a mouthwash. That's it. Your teeth will never be so beautiful/healthy. Also, don't neglect your tongue. That's where bacteria really settle in, brush that guy too. 

* If this at all motivates you to floss (understanding why do something is always more helpful to me then how), here is why: it isn't to get crap out from between your teeth (though added benefit). That's where bacteria forms and think of them like a forming anthill and you stepping on them. Your preventing bacteria from making a home in your mouth and it's a battle to be fought every day. Do this and your whole mouth will be outrageously hygienic. 

**El Fin**

I'll admit, when I started this guide I didn't intend for it to be so long. I hope despite the word count it is welcome and provides anything useful for anyone. Again, I can't emphasize enough, I would love any of your open tips/insights/suggestions for anything related to self-care. I'm quite passionate about it (as you can perhaps see).  

***

Below I'll suggest a few more sections that I don't have any tips for, I'd love it if you gave your best strategies in the comments. 

***

**Mental Health** 

I'm an anxious wreck and full-time stress ball in no position to offer advice to anyone. (Except exercise, that has helped me immeasurably and beyond words). I'm including the section though because it is important, and again, I really encourage any suggestions you ladies may have as I could definitely use it!

**Time Management**

Definite an important skill that ties into the rest. How do you do it??

**Sleep**

Sleep is an often-underrated part of the self-care process. There is quantity and quality in regards to making the most of it, and many of us (definitely myself) find ourselves lacking in one or both sections. If you wake up feeling amazing, please post how you do it!

**Relaxation**

Quite similar to mental health, and they definitely go hand in hand. But I think one is more long-term and the other is more ""how do you empty your mind for an hour or two?"" Mind is always buzzing and I can't shut it off. 

***
Hopefully some of you find this helpful, and some of you can contribute where I most certainly lack.

3h1htx,Trust,"Avianca flight 011 was flying a leg from Paris to Spain in November 1983. The pilot ignored the warning system that was telling him he was at an incorrect altitude and the approach controller had given the plane faulty information. The pilot crashed the plane into the side of a mountain killing 162 people on board because he was an idiot and acknowledged, then **disregarded** the warning alarm.

What does this have to do with me and my man?

There are always posts here where ladies are trying to be Mrs. Perfect for him. I want to be Mrs. Perfect too, there's no faulting that by itself. Some ladies may be innocent and unaware, but I think a lot of these kinds of posts are by women who are nervous and afraid. 

They found TRP or rpw and through those lenses see that, along with their own damaging behavior, their man isn't a great or natural leader. He's tripping some red flags, but she wants to give him the benefit of her doubt. 

She's basically here asking how to ignore it or fluff pillows around his bullshit to make it more comfortable. DONT FLUFF PILLOWS FOR BULLSHIT TO GET COMFORTABLE. **You are his partner, point it out.** Respectfully and tactfully acknowledging that he could better his position, leadership, whatever, is ok. 

[I'm not talking about nagging him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2y95v1/a_powerful_image_that_speaks_for_itself/)

I'm talking about things like, ""He really hates my friends and my family and when I spend time with them. He must think they're not good for me, and I need to trust him."" Or ""He spends his paycheck in two days and is in debt to all his friends and he just needs a few dollars from me to pay rent and get groceries and beer and go to the casino. He needs his hobbies and his alone time, so I'm going to work on not being so guarded with my money. I need to trust him."" Or ""He wrapped a towing chain around my waist and shackled me to the radiator for my own safety. I feel a little uncomfortable but he says it's for my safety so I trust him but he's been gone for a week and I'm really thirsty, am I a harpy bitch if I ask for some water?"" 

You're not his mother, he's not perfect the way he is, and if he's worth a damn, he's not going to get salty and have a hissy fit because you let him know he could benefit from downloading YNAB or something. But if he's failing in major areas, you don't just say fuck it and fly into the side of a mountain! 

Just because he is *your* man does not mean his a *trustworthy* man. Not all men are worth submitting to and following but ones that are sure won't complain about his lady wanting to keep him sharp. If you're six months in or a year in or however long into a relationship and he's a bumbling moron or a controlling, short-tempered micromanager then LEAVE! 

Being a rpw **does not** mean ignoring all of your built in alarm systems and blindly trusting a man no matter how badly you want to! 

Being a responsible adult who is in charge of yourself means taking an honest look at how capable and trustworthy the man is who you're allowing to lead you! 

Yes, every man has flaws. You are wholly welcome to support your man. I support mine. But if his stomach starts getting soft I might give him a playful poke and ask him if we can have dead lifts for dessert. 

Being a rpw is not about taking on all of his burdens and making his life a pleasure cruise and pretending he's perfect. It's about supporting a man in a way that enables him to be the best man he can be. He can't be the best man he can be if you let him fail and just cringe and hope it gets better. Maybe serve him a drink while the house burns down because *you need to trust him!* 

A mans burdens are rightfully his to carry, so you help him to grow into the kind of man who *can* carry them. 

There's shutting up and letting him do his thing, and there's ignoring problems and red flags. 

Examples of ladies doing it right: 

--[Doorknobs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2w7doh/the_doorknob_incident_that_wasnt/)

--[Sewage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/25aoo1/displaying_trust_lfmf/?)

--[Owning her misbehavior.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1wcudk/rpw_is_both_improving_and_hurting_my_relationship/?) 

And [this is interesting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1xk830/sometimes_the_first_officer_actually_overrules/?) The comments are important. 

So basically, you're not **only** there to look pretty and blindly trust. Trust is earned, not given! You're there to look pretty and **be a smart FO.**

Not every relationship is perfect. Not every example of trust is something like a home repair. Sometimes you do have to cut the lifeboats and ride the storm out. I have, and it don't regret it. But I knew all of what I was getting into, and I needed to consult with **no one** because I was not looking for reasons to ignore a blaring warning and make myself a martyr. 

Use your heads. There are times to be sweet and submissive, and times to gtfo of a sinking ship.

3gqe50,"If you're a guy, and you're here, read this.","Guys have terrible advice for women. I see it time and time again, and you're all terrible shit at this.

There's a reason. Guys rationalize bad decisions and past decisions as ""preferences.""  I won't dig up the quote right now, but Rollo made a very good point to this theme: Guys will have a preference for whatever worked before. If nerdy chicks show interest in a guy, he will gain a preference for nerdy chicks.

This isn't because nerdy chicks are necessarily sexier or more feminine, but because guys come from an essentially needy position. A position of no abundance.

On TRP we focus on abundance mentality to try to subvert this natural disadvantage, but it's true. Guys will never, ever, have as many options as women.

So when I hear a guy tell a woman, ""No, you keep doing what you're doing, I like a woman with a little spunk..""

This guy doesn't have a preference for ""spunk."" No, he's an idiot who is so thirsty he'll take any woman he can get, and he'll accept her self-proclaimed handicaps as features. 

He'll think to himself, ""gosh, she's bitchy, rude, and abrasive..... well, I like a strong independent woman.""

And that's his rationalization. Because he's a thirsty fucking idiot.

But when they start preaching about their preferences as though it's going to be useful advice for women, then we've got a problem.

And we do have this problem here. Guys think they know what good advice for women is.

Women, if you take this advice- ""i find book smarts to be very attractive"" I promise you will waste a considerable amount of time and energy doing something that doesn't really boost your SMV. Oh sure, some guys might say they have the preference, but ultimately, book smarts aren't actually sufficient to create attraction, nor required for said attraction to exist. Guys will not assist you in actual SMV building. Because, guys want to fuck you anyway, and will basically accept you as you are. But that doesn't help your chances with higher quality guys.

If you're a dude, and you think you should be chiming in, read the fucking side bar. Then read it again. Then *don't* chime in. Because it's unlikely you've got much to contribute.

If you're a guy and you contribute and it's not gender neutral (that is, none of that ""as a guy..."" bullshit), then it's out of here, and you're out of here.

3ermax,Am I 'redpill'?,"I was recently told by a close friend of mine who's staunchly ""feminist"" that I was holding women back by being so open and following of ""lady redpil ideas"".



I had no idea what this meant. I had heard of redpill, but not 'lady redpill'. I had to use google only to discover this subreddit. I thought I'd ask you what you thought on the subject and to judge for yourselves. If I am ""redpill"", it will change how I see repill and the ideas they claim.

* I, as a stay at home mom, make sure the house is clean and laundry is done and food is waiting for Hubby when he gets home. This is **my** job and I take pride in my work.

* I make sure that I always look good and take into consideration his tastes. I still have and wear some things he things are tacky, but few and far between. I get dressed in the morning and make sure I don't spend my days in pajamas. That would make like depressing as hell.

* I buy food he likes and make things he likes because I like seeing him happy. That makes me happy.

* If he asks me to do something, I do it. I know that he's not going to ask me to do anything crazy or outlandish so i just trust him. Why do I need to argue when I know he's asking me for a good reason? 

* I at least try every video game he likes, and I don't bug him about his video game usage. if he feels like he needs to play for 18+ hours, he must be stressed out and need an escape. I let him have it.

* I make sure at functions that I always get him his food and drink first. 

* I visit him at work when I can and bring him lunches sometimes. I don't pack his lunch, as he likes to go out to eat with coworkers. 



Now, I have ALWAYS been this way. I like putting him first because it makes ME happy. I get joy from him having joy. I

 find it funny that she complains to me about her husband not helping her with the house, the kids, or when she's ill but when I offer her suggestions she gets crazy on me about how I'm killing women by being a stereotype. 

Well, my husband without me asking:

* insists on getting up with the baby. He says for me to be a mom during the day I need a good nights sleep

* brings me flowers, gifts, and grabs my butt daily after 7 years of marriage 

* will take care of me if I'm sick and never complain if I ask for extra help now and again. He knows if I'm not making dinner or the house is messy, I must feel like hell.

* encourages me to try new things and talks to me about my hobbies

* will regulate his video game usage on his own and go days without playing some times just because he loves family time too. 

* brag about his hot wife that plays video games to his friends. Our house is even the hangout.


 I believe that every women has a right to choose what the want from life and no one should be told they are ""wrong"". Why is it so hard for her to understand that maybe some ladies LIKE making their partner happy?


If I am living a redpill lifestyle-I'll be blown away. I just figured I was treating my husband with love and respect. Isn't that what we all are supposed to do?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3ermax/am_i_redpill/,1438002081.0,58,0.9,34,RedPillWomen,redpillwomenmaybe
3bz4b5,Mainstream feminism is the Munchhausen by proxy of ideologies.,"Something I have noticed about mainstream feminism and mainstream feminists is that, even among those who are more reasonable or those passive followers who claim not to like the radicals, they *love* misery.

They just can't get enough of it. And they can't abide seeing someone doing something differently, or even the same way, who is happy.

The same feminists can complain that a happy housewife is abiding by a 1950s patriarchal structure that oppresses her and that a happy career woman is sleeping her way to the top. The same feminists can complain that a happy young mother is being hurt and oppressed and that a single woman happily sleeping with a number of men is being used by them. Whenever someone claims to be happy, feminism is here to say ""No, you're not, you're just kidding yourself. REALLY you're sad and hurt and miserable.""

The only women feminism seems to like? Sad women. If a woman is an unhappy housewife airing her dirty laundry then that's fine. If a career woman admits to sleeping her way to the top or complains about how hard it is and how lonely she is, then she's encouraged. If a young mother is stressed, overworked and doesn't really like her children, that is admirable. If a woman is sleeping around and having difficulty coming to terms with her feelings on it then she is lauded as some sort of heroine. When you're miserable, feminism is here to cuddle you, coddle you and tell you that it's all men's fault, or the patriarchy's fault if there isn't a man to directly blame. The unhappy housewife is oppressed by internalized misogyny and her husband. The career woman is oppressed by her male coworkers and the glass ceiling. The young mother is oppressed by her children and their father. The single woman is oppressed by these noncomittal men and her own internalized misogyny.

Mainstream feminism sets out looking for illness, makes it up or creates it when it fails to find it and presents itself as the cure to these ailments.

And in many ways this seeking can actually help. Looking for social illness **when there is an illness** can help. If someone is genuinely unhappy, why shouldn't they look for the cause? It has helped people overcome all forms of discrimination and has helped us craft a world where we are largely free to do as we please, largely without hurting other people. But when the illness is not there, it hurts. Because feminism can't exist without illness. It needs to be the source of a cure, or, when there is no cure, it needs to be the treatment itself. When the children are healthy, feminism needs to feed them rat poison and break their legs so it can heal them again. When the children can't be hurt, feminism needs to lock them indoors and tell them they are ill until it can poison them again.

Because if people, especially women, are happy, feminism can't do anything. So it must assume everyone is ill, convince everyone they are ill and its followers must make themselves ill so that feminism can keep on curing people.

And this is why we need to avoid this sort of thought pattern.

Feminism tries to make you ill or make you think you are ill insidiously.

It says you are being hurt if you're a happy housewife.

It says you are being oppressed if you're a working woman.

It says your male partners can't lay a finger on you even if you beat them black and blue.

It says that forcing you into sex and denying you sex are both just as violent.

When an unhappy feminist, even a normally rational mainstream feminist, or feminist-lite, questions your happiness, that is because they need to find an illness to cure. They want you to be ill.

But that isn't a healthy mentality. When you are continually dissatisfied, continually looking for the next best thing and continually looking for reasons not to be happy, you are *guaranteed* to be unhappy. No matter who you are, what you do, who you're with or where you're heading, if you are looking for oppression, unhappiness and the likes, it will find you.

By all means, if you are genuinely unhappy take a long hard look at yourself, your situation and ask why.

But if it isn't broken, don't break it just so you can fix it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3bz4b5/mainstream_feminism_is_the_munchhausen_by_proxy/,1435915040.0,101,0.89,32,RedPillWomen,SuperSlavisWife

3a676k,FR AWALT is true,"I've had some serious emotional stuff over the last months, and if I'm honest, the last few years. I was a wreck, really angry, mad, feeling helpless, feeling like life had lied to me in this gigantic horrible way. Why wasn't my husband treating me the way I expected? Why wasn't my life the beautiful fairy-tale that I deserved???

I filed for divorce in Feb. bc things had spiraled out of control. My husband was drinking, I was yelling. He worked too much, I yelled more. The more he ""messed up"", the more controlling and mean I was. I felt like if I could just get him to listen to me, if I could control things, get him in line...

I found the Red Pill when I was living in a hotel room with my toddler and a mountain of fear. I was really angry when I first read it and frankly, I still get upset about it. Accepting the red pill makes me look at myself in a clear light and that's so much harder than just blaming my husband and the world. 

Things I've learned about myself:

1. I MUST cultivate an aura of being pleasant and nice to be around. That bossy, bitchy attitude that works well for the corporate woman on t.v. doesn't work well in real life. No one likes her, and as a result, her life sucks. I've been in trouble countless times at work and at home for being a total jerk. It's too late at my work to save the relationship. I already wrecked it. Thankfully, my marriage isn't totally gone. I notice that when I shut my mouth, smile, and allow things to happen, it works out really well, even if it isn't what I ""planned"". 


Case in point: this weekend, my husband (yes, we are working things out), went out and bought a ton of lights for the kitchen and a motion sensor light to come on when I walk into the kitchen. Pretty sweet, right! He starts working on it, and after awhile, couldn't figure out one part of it. He said, I can't figure this out, I've tried everything...I'll finish later. Usually that's when I would get super mad bc that's the usual way things work, he starts a cool project, hits a wall, and stops, and I get angry that things are left undone. I said OK baby, thank you for doing that. It's so cool! And went back to making dinner...


and he went back to finishing the project! Once again he hit a wall, couldn't figure it out, and said, I can't fix it, I'm so sorry. I said, don't worry about it! Thank you for doing all that. And...he kept working. It was unbelievable! I was thinking...wow! This works! Being nice makes him want to help!!!


2. Time management. 
I haven't figured this one out yet, or rather, I'm still falling victim to a lot of laziness. I've stopped the netflix (yay!) and it's amazing what amount of cleaning/organizing/work I can accomplish in the same time it takes for a 30 min show! I still read reddit far too much, but I feel like some of it is still really important to my growth as a woman. I read Red Pill A LOT - which leads me to my third point. 


This is humbling. I'm not proud of it. 


3. AWALT. Including me.
I filed for divorce bc I was sick of the marriage and wanted a new life. I fantasized non-stop about the amazing man that ""I deserved"" and that was surely waiting around the corner to, as they say on red pill, captain save a ho. Um...yeah. I turn 31 this August, I'm attractive, but not toned, cuss too much, and my career is underwhelming (I focus a lot on my kid and my home life, which is good) Slowly, I started to see that...


I have a husband that loves me and our child and makes a ton of money. He works all the time, but our life is extremely comfortable, and he treats me like a queen. Why am I walking away from that? Yeah, he drank too much, that was not O.K. and that boundary has been established and he isn't drinking like that now. Yes, I yelled constantly, and was super mean to him, calling him nasty names and emasculating him constantly. Hard to accept that dark side of myself, but it was the truth. 

The choices now make me feel a bit disappointed in myself for ""settling"" but I'm making a logical, reasonable decision when it comes to RP philosophy. Hollywood glamorizes women like me racing out, divorcing the husband, taking maximum cash, and saddling up to the next guy that walks by. 

Really, in the real world...it doesn't work like that. There aren't amazing men in the wings just waiting to get involved with divorced women raising a child alone. I mentioned earlier how important my daughter is and how much I value that time with her. Marrying/dating someone else would only infringe on our time together and it would take my daughter's dad further out of her life than he is now (he literally works constantly and is gone for weeks at a time on projects). Staying together isn't the easier choice, it's humbling, and embarrassing bc I told so many friends all the ""wrongs"" he did...so many of my friends can't understand why I would stay with him. The hamster is strong. YOU DESERVE BETTER! 

Yes, I do deserve better, and so does my husband. 

That's why I'm focusing on my own self improvement. Being nice, managing my time better, being grateful for this second chance, and trying to remember that AWALT (including me!) when my own hamster goes into overdrive and I want to send nasty texts or blame my husband when things go bad in my own life due to my own actions.


One final story. I play kickball and it's competitive. I love it. Plenty of the wives are on the sidelines drinking while we play, (I'm on a co-ed team), and one in particular stands out. This woman is about 27, with a child that's 5 (no dad in the picture on that one), and she ""got pregnant"" with a total Alpha who is on our team and he has completely been supportive of her, the baby, as well as the first child. It's truly incredible to see it. She went from broke and struggling, clinging to him, to him getting her a new ride. 

Anyway, is she grateful? Is she cheering him on and happy as a clam? NO. SHE ISN'T. She's on the sidelines getting DRUNK, every single game, and complaining that being a mom is so hard. It's baffling when you know the red pill and you see things as clearly as they really are. Anyway, on this particular day, she's a few beers in, talking nasty to her older child, and everyone on the team is deciding where to eat after the game. Some are going to a far away restaurant and some are staying closer by. Her hubby, and about half the team, want to stay closer by, but she flips out bc her girlfriend is going to the farther away place. ""We never go anywhere I want to go!!"" she says. He stays calm, where do you want to go? what about pizza? ""NO!! We eat pizza all the time!!! (wow, she doesn't cook and stays at home?) Repeat the back and forth as the rest of us are silent. Then she says, I'm leaving! Takes the stroller, yells at the older kid, and starts walking angrily. He follows.


One of the other guys on the team (Alpha dude) says ""he's going to get an earful in the car."" His girl says, why? what did he do wrong? 
Guy says, ""it's not what he did. It's about how she feels about herself.""


That was a real breakthrough for me. All those times I was angry, and all the times I get angry now, I try to center myself and say, who is this anger about? It's usually myself being disappointed in my own actions. Hard to accept, but for me, it's the truth.


Thanks for all the advice out there, ladies. I might not be where I want to be as a RPW now, but I can see that each day I AM getting to a better place with myself and my own actions. I hope to one day have a FR that says all positive stuff, and I can say Look! Figured it all out, yay! Not there yet, but getting there.

38pk3a,Your Relationship is Not Equal,"Every time we get a woman asking about our relationships, concerned that they might not be “equal enough”, we always give the same canned response, which amounts to “We have different responsibilities, but we are *equally* important.” This, however, is disingenuous. 

It is almost as though we have bought into their line that equality is important, and that if things aren’t “equal”, then they must be bad and we must be oppressed.  But, using the word “equal” makes no sense when talking about a red pill relationship. It’s not as though I can say “He makes more money than I do, but I wash the dishes, so everything is equal!” That’s not how it works, we can’t measure those things on the same scale. I have no idea how many washed dishes it takes to be equal to his extra hours at the office. 

When claiming to be equal, we are focusing on the wrong things, whether our contributions to the relationship matches his. But, that’s not what’s important, what is important is that we are doing our best to make him happy. In a relationship, it is your responsibility to make sure to do everything in your power to make the other person happy, and if you picked a good captain, he will do the same for you. 

In a way the type of equality we do have is that our obligation to make him happy is equally as important as his obligation to make us happy. We are the most important people in our partners’ lives and we have responsibility to make sure that we influence them in a positive way. Of course, since men and women are different, the things that involves are going to be different.

At the end of the day, I don’t wash the dishes because he makes more money than I do. I am not keeping score of whose duties are more important, who works the hardest, and who has done what for whom lately. I wash the dishes because it is one of the things I can do to fill his happiness bar, then he comes by and smacks me on the butt, because that’s one of the things that fills my happiness bar. It’s based on the principle that if you do things to make him happy, he’ll want to do things to make you happy, which in turn makes you want to do things to make him happy, and so on. It is a positive reinforcement cycle that encourages both parties to fill the other’s happiness bars. 

That is what is important about you duties, not whether they are equally hard, equally time consuming, or even equally important, it’s whether you are going above and beyond to make him happy, even if at first it means doing more than him. No, that’s not equal, but so what? Someone has to be giving, and someone has to go first, if you want to have a positive relationship with your partner.

3899ni,Caught my man bragging about me today :),"Hi!! I mostly lurk here, but post a little on my main account. I've been browsing this forum the last six months or so, and have been with my SO for over two years. My thinking naturally lined up with much of what's here, but actively reading has definitely helped me to remain more present and cognizant in my relationship. 

Anyway, I'm dating the best man ever. Fit, hard working, successful, hilarious, and treats me better than I ever could have imagined. 

We both worked our tails off this year, and are splurging on a nice trip out of the country at the end of next month. We have been emailing back and forth a ton lately - travel arrangements, bikinis he likes, forwarding restaurant menus, etc. anyway, I guess his big fingers goofed because he accidentally (??) forwarded me an email chain involving some guys at the office. 

They were all planning a guys night out, bitching about their SO's not letting them have any fun (one actually said ""ugh women are the worst""). His response was ""sorry fellas, think I'm gonna sit this one out since my girl always has dinner on the table at 7 and just texted me a pic of some lingerie, looks like we might be a little tied up.""  Following were several men basically saying ""yeah yeah, we know you like her, shut up"" and variations of. So I know this isn't the first time :)

Ladies, if you're with a great man TAKE CARE OF HIM. I always have food on the table, the place is clean, and I look put together when he gets home. I also do little things, like taking his dry cleaning, or scheduling appointments for him. My man is busy as hell, but because I help him through the week, he has more time to relax on the weekends. Without fail he always takes me out on a sweet and thoughtful date night every weekend. I help him take a load off, and he loves showing his appreciation. 

Anyway. I love this sub &amp; how it's helped me find immense happiness in my relationship, thought I'd share something silly and happy :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3899ni/caught_my_man_bragging_about_me_today/,1433271506.0,114,0.94,33,RedPillWomen,[deleted]

36egvs,The Submissive Wife on TLC,"Many of you shared that you saw the preview for the new show called The Submissive Wife on TLC.  Where I live, it aired last night and I happened to catch it.  

What did you think?  What did you take away? 

I must say...I enjoyed it!  The veteran ""Submissive Wife"" did a lot of things that I really liked.  

1.  The Blast Off

The Submissive Wife sent her husband and kids off to work and school with breakfast, coffee, a smile on her face and encouragement.  She made sure everyone's day got off to a good start with a pleasant morning.  I really liked that, because I know how a stressful morning can really put you in a bad mood for the rest of the day.  The husband and kids really seemed to appreciate it too.  The husband said he felt prepared for a tough day at work after her send off.  It's just a little bit of effort on her part but really made a difference for her family.  

2. The Homecoming

She made sure the house was picked up and she looked nice.  She welcomed her husband with a kiss and then got him something to drink and made a snack.  She also put away her phone and had the kids do the same.  If he had a good day and wanted to talk she engaged him, and if he was grumpy and wanted peace and quiet she respected that too.  The husband mentioned that her cheery welcome encouraged him to leave work at work.  He said, how can you be a grouch when you receive such a caring welcome home?  He looked forward to coming home and spending time with family.  She made her home a sanctuary of peace and tranquility for everyone.  What husband wouldn't love that?  Another great way she was serving her family.  You might argue that the snacks and cold drinks are a little over the top, particularly if you work outside the home as well.  But, I think the sentiment is still the same.  Make your home someplace your husband **wants**  to come home to for rest and relaxation.

3.  Keep the Love Tank Full

The Submissive Wife said again and again that a great marriage starts in the bedroom.  She made it clear that she is always available to her husband.  She made her husband feel wanted and attractive by being so receptive and open to sex.  She kept up her appearance and was playful and flirty.  She said that sometimes she wasn't in the mood, but she has learned over the years to get in mood and get in the mood quick.  Again, a great attitude and a great example.

Her husband says that his wife chose to submit, but *he* had to be someone worth following.  Her actions inspired him to be a better man.  This couple demonstrates that no amount of nagging and complaining will make your husband want to change, but *you* can change your behavior and attitudes.  

When the wife upped her game, he was inspired to show his appreciation and do things that made her feel special.  Like this woman demonstrated, we should change our behavior and attitudes not out of an expectation of reciprocation from our husbands, but out of a desire to create our own happiness.  

As women we have an incredibly powerful role.  Our behavior and attitude directly influences the behavior and attitudes of our family.  Little things, like brining a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a cold drink in the evening add up over time.  They require a little self discipline and effort on our part, but can pay huge dividends for our family.   

Also, I hope that other woman gets her act together.  I would feel overwhelmed if I let that much laundry pile up.  Why does she need so many naps?!?!!? 

And lastly, chicken and tatertots do not a meal make.  Learn to cook something for your poor husband.

34jdvs,"As a newly minted RPW, I got a second chance with my guy. The difference in our new relationship is nothing short of amazing.","Hi guys,

Former BP shrew here.  I've had a chance to turn things around, and just wanted to share my experience as a way to say thanks to the RPW community.

I was with my boyfriend for a few years, and we broke up.  Well, more so, *he* broke up with *me.*  I was devastated.  I devolved into a grieving mess, but in the process, I also had some big wake up calls about myself.  

Through my grief, it slowly dawned on me that I had not been an easy person to be with.  It's not an excuse, but I didn't realize how much I was acting like my mother.  What I was taught as a child is that men can never do anything right, that women are martyrs and victims, and that everything the man does wrong must be pointed out to him in order to get him to change and get with the program.  My ex was the first guy I'd deeply loved, and I'd treated him just like my mother treated my father!  No wonder he wanted to get away from me!  And the worst part was, being a nagging controlling bitch *didn't even make me happy*.  What the hell was I doing with my life???  I treated the person most special to me worse than I'd ever dream of treating my acquaintances.  It was clearly time for a change.

The one thing that I did do correctly immediately after the breakup was to respect his decision.  I calmly told him that I didn't want the breakup, but that I knew he had every right to leave if that was what he wanted.  I did not beg, I did not guilt, I did not do anything that impinged upon his right to leave a relationship he no longer wanted.  I dealt with my emotional pain in private, because it wasn't appropriate to try to burden him with that.  This reaction was partly out of pride, but as I learned more I was thankful that I handled things this way.  It gave me the right foundation for the larger change. 

We had a few talks after the breakup, and I told him all that I'd realized about how I had treated him.  I apologized and said I'd be working on myself with the end goal of appreciating and respecting my man, and hoped it would be him.

After months of silence, we recently got back together.  I'm so relieved that I have been given another chance with my guy.  He told me that his decision to leave was 50% genuine unhappiness, and 50% not realizing that we had a special connection.  While we were apart, the last piece became really apparent to him, and the first piece was something he knew would be helped if I was successful in the changes I talked about, so he felt it was probably worth giving it another shot.  Plus he never stopped loving me, nor I him.  We'd both moved on from the former relationship, but not one another, if that makes sense.

I'd done a great deal of research and work on myself in the interim.  I had never learned how to be feminine in a relationship, so I taught myself how.  In addition to RPW, I've got a male relative in my life who is a prime example of the concepts.  He used to be with a nagging shrew, and he was miserable while with her.  Now he's with someone who loves him, always gives him the benefit of the doubt, and does not question him.  I've never seen him so happy, and he treasures the hell out of her.  Clearly, there was something to be learned from that.  

Since my boyfriend and I reconciled, I've been working hard to put my RPW lessons into our everyday life.  We may be in another honeymoon period, but I know that at least part of how great everything is right now is due to the change in me.  

I appreciate him, I let him make decisions and I do not question them, I don't try to solve his problems for him, I don't try to be his mother or his therapist, and I have stepped back and relaxed into the relationship.  I let him be the masculine energy with me as the feminine energy.  I trust him and let him protect and guide me.  I don't tell him what to do and how to do it, instead only talking about my feelings about a topic when it's relevant and necessary.  As a result, I'm in a hell of a lot better mood pretty consistently, so that also provides a feedback loop into doing all those things that matter.  

We're just a month or so into our new relationship, so this hasn't become second nature to me yet, but I am bound and determined to keep it up and let this way of relating become part of me.  I'm thrilled with myself when I get it right.  For example, this morning, I saw that he'd accidentally left the front porch light on all night.  The old me would have immediately pointed that ""mistake"" out to him.  The new me flipped the light off, reminded herself that being in love and having a happy relationship was so much more important than a stupid light, and went back to snuggling and drinking coffee with him.  He doesn't even know that he left the light on, because who cares?!  Not me.

Also, he's seen solid evidence of how hard I've worked.  Last weekend, we faced a situation that historically makes me anxious and stressed out.  I noticed it when I started feeling overwhelmed, made sure I did not say a single word while I felt that way, and proceeded to internally handle my shit to avoid slipping into my old (stupid and pointless) pattern.  My boyfriend is very intuitive and in tune with me, so he'd unfortunately noticed that I got quiet during this process, and afterward he told me he was fighting off the urge to flee because he expected me to act how I used to act.  But I didn't!  I recognized my pattern on my own, stopped it before it started, and powered through.  After about a minute of being quiet, I went right back to being happy, feminine, and grateful that I had the opportunity to spend time with my man.

Because he'd noticed the change in me with that specific situation and wanted to talk with me about it, I told him I'd really been working hard to make sure that I enjoy my life and our relationship and that I'm always respectful and loving toward him.  I shared that I actually felt a little shaky, vulnerable, and uncertain in the aftermath of shaking myself out of my old pattern.  That reaction made me even more sure that my old habits were an anxious defense mechanism against true intimacy, and that I was left feeling unsure and vulnerable *because* I was opening up in ways I hadn't let myself open up before.

And, sex: yes, please.  We've always had a bit of an insane chemical attraction, so we've always fucked like rabbits.  We still do that, but we've added in some dominance/submission and it's made it even hotter.  We both thrive when he's in charge.  It's my job to please him, and, in turn, he makes sure that I'm well taken care of.  It's a mini-version of the larger relationship dynamic and we're both very pleased with it.

In summary, I am grateful that I got the chance to make things right, and I am proud that I'm doing it.  The difference in how we relate to one another is nothing short of amazing.  He wants to be close to me, he wants to buy me little tokens of appreciation, he wants to take me on trips, he wants to be the man in the relationship, and I have figured out how to stay feminine so that he can be the man.  As a result, I see evidence that he is a man in charge *who knows what he's doing*.  And he sees the new me as all of the good stuff that he has always loved about me and very little about the bad stuff that made him want to leave me.  

He still has some times where he's still uncertain whether this new me is here to stay, but he does see that every time I have risen to the occasion.  I may slip up here or there, but I don't want that and as soon as I notice it, I will resolve it.  I know it will simply take time for this to become habit to me and for him to understand the change is here to stay.  

We're both ridiculously happy people now.  It feels SO good to come home and relax and know that I don't have to worry about decisions and that I don't have to be in control.  I just revert to being happy, feminine, sweet me.  It's a huge relief to not feel like the world is on my shoulders.  

It all seems *so simple* and *so obvious* in retrospect.  Thanks to my research (including this subreddit), my humbling look at how awful I had treated the person I loved more than anything, and my commitment to do the hard work of real personal change, I'm getting the relationship that I have always wanted.

To anyone taking a good hard look at themselves and realizing they're on the way to killing the love in their relationship like I once did, do the hard work to change yourself.  The end result is a beautiful thing.

3323c8,Things I've learned as a 19-year-old in college,"Here are some things I've been changing in my lifestyle that have worked. Follow these rules and you'll definitely earn more respect. 

1. Stop cursing. Every time you say ""fuck"" or ""shit"" it's a turn off. Try substituting them for something else like ""stuff"". 

2. Cook more/bake more if you can. Colleges usually have communal kitchens or if you're living in a dorm with a kitchen, try to cook something on the stove instead of microwaving things. I've started to bring baked goods and share them with my classmates (male &amp; female) and people always have a positive response. 

3. If it's nice out (spring/summer), wear a dress. Yesterday, I was walking around and I had a female stranger at Chipotle compliment me along with my two male classmates. If you make the effort, people notice. 

4. Spend less time on your phone when you walk around &amp; smile. It's so easy to walk around campus, have resting bitch face, and be on your phone. Don't be that girl. You might be that girl and not even realize it. Take more time out to walk without your phone.  I've practiced smiling at strangers when I walk and I've been getting compliments and guys are more willing to ask me questions, tourists are more willing to ask me for directions (I live in a big city), and guys talk to me more. 

5. Become interested in something on campus where you're involved with men (aside from baking, artsy stuff). 
I've been going to pick-up soccer games and been watching more soccer matches to learn more about my favorite teams. I've also been upping my language game and been learning more German and French since those are my favorite two languages. Watching soccer is fun but I also get to surround myself with quality guys who are athletic/masculine. 

6. Never have sex before you know that you're in an exclusive, committed thing. Know that as a woman, you're the gatekeeper of sex and when you give that up too easily, it's hard for a guy to actually see you more as a plate. 
This was the toughest lesson I had to accept but it's so true. 

7. Never tell a guy that you want to ""go watch a movie"" because that's basically code for sex before you've established boundaries. You're going to end up having sex. 

8. On Facebook, don't take any pictures with red solo cups, drinking, partying, spring break pictures, etc. It's trashy and if you have any delete them even if there's just one of them up there. You will differentiate yourself between 90% of the women of on your campus. Also, selfies are kinda dumb. 

9. This is kinda debatable but I've stopped initiating kissing when and if I go out on a date with someone. I honestly believe that if the guy is really into you, he'll kiss you first assuming you've given out all the right signs. 

10. Skincare is important. Go to a dermatologist and get your acne/eye bags/other skin problems treated so you look good naturally. 

11. In college, you're going to be tempted to join Greek life, go to fraternities, and go out to bars/clubs. Now, even though I'm a fan of Greek life and I have friends in sororities, none of them have ever met their boyfriends at a fraternity party even though some of their bf's might be Greek.If you do join a sorority, learn about their reputations. Just remember that any place with alcohol is never conducive to meeting your future bf. 

12. Having a boyfriend is never your end goal. You must keep improving yourself as a woman and that's gonna take time. 

13. I stopped drinking two months ago for good. I went from being drunk at pregames to drinking a beer or two to quitting. It's been a journey but honestly, l don't regret the decision. I think it's okay to have alcohol every now and then but honestly, I think I'm better without it. 

14. Don't date a guy based on looks alone and don't justify your plate status because the guy you're seeing is hot. He's hot and he knows it. And chances are, if you're a plate and he doesn't want to commit to you, he probably isn't committing to you or anyone. Again, if you go into something with the intentions of wanting an LTR, leave with those same intentions.

321cm9,Actually listening to Him was the best thing I could do for our relationship,"I wanted to post a bit of an update to my first RPW post [Undoing the damage I did - he won't lead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2e2wuu/ltr_undoing_the_damage_i_did_he_wont_lead/)


I was pushing for what *I* wanted. What my view of this ideal relationship with Him would be. I was setting myself up for failure, and more so I was setting Him up for failure.  It's really easy for me to get caught up in the idea of this pretty romantic pinterest bumper sticker relationship. It's a huge character flaw of mine. Since swallowing the pill, and trying to put RPW heart I have made quite a few changes. 

* I've almost completely stopped going in his office unless he called me or I have something legitimately important to ask him. I've helped him foster a space that is his in our home.  
* I've made a conscious effort not to interrupt him. Even when he's not telling the story just right, or it's just the two of us at home. 
* I've actually started listening to him when he talks. I didn't think this was that big of a problem until I made the change. I'd just tune him out and half listen. Super rude. 

And I missed a lot when I tuned out. Because now - I'm seeing how he leads this relationship. Leading the relationship does not mean he meets a set criteria of Alpha Traits. That was my misconception in my very first post. ""Why won't he do A, B, and C, all good leaders do those things!"" (Again with the grass is greener...). Leading means he is his own man. That he respects himself. 

So now that I'm listening properly to my husband-to-be. What am I hearing?

I'm hearing him discuss how his buddy at work is getting a new car. Not so much that Coworker is getting a new car - but Coworker's Wife is selling his car, giving him her car, and getting a shiny new car. I'm hearing Fiance say ""This won't happen in our relationship. I make money, I'll buy the car I want. You do the same.""

I'm hearing him discuss how his groomsmen broke up with his girlfriend over religious differences. I hear him say ""He needs to stand up for himself, because either she's bluffing and she'll stop this, or she's not and that's not something they can fix anyway - they would be happier apart"" 

I'm hearing how justified his frustrations are with my hypocrisy in bed. 

I'm hearing him say ""I appreciate that you take care this and that, I have other things on my mind.""

I'm hearing him say ""This is how I'm going to handle that""

I'm hearing him delegate, I'm hearing him relax, and I'm hearing him laugh a lot more now. 

This was never about Fiance not leading, this was always about me being a selfish twat. Admitting this was my problem is not the same as accepting and doing something about it. I'm thankful for the ladies in this group who have provided harsh advice from the beginning. I'm thankful for my captain, my future hubby! Now the only thing to do is to *show* him daily I am thankful.

Of course, it is extreme to suggest that a man would commit suicide because of this. However, do not be surprised at how much damage you, as a woman, are capable of doing to your spouse. 

Men face the world everyday. They encounter obstacles in their daily lives with their coworkers and their family members. They get stressed at work. They deal with many problems and fix them, as best as they can. Sometimes they don't do a perfect job, and sometimes what they do isn't to your liking, but I guarantee that good men in general put their best foot forward to simply do better.

2wl44t,I am engaged!,"My boyfriend proposed a few days ago, and I said yes! The way it happened just showed how right we are for each other. And I really believe it could not have happened without the support and hard truths that I got from this sub.

Two Christmases ago, I was a FWB trying to rationalize why it was okay. I was still hurting from the breakup of the marriage I had entered into as a teenager, and didn't have plans for the future. Thankfully, I had supportive friends, family, and community. And, very importantly, I had you ladies.

FWB is generally a bad idea. It adds a number to your count, lowering your SMV (mine was only one to start with, but every bit counts). It could have gone very wrong and I could have been hurt big-time. You all told me that. When I have daughters, I will advise them to stay away from it. I advise you ladies to stay away from it. Yet, applying RPW principles, by the grace of God in my weakness and foolishness, allowed me to turn this into a legitimate relationship. I fully embraced the feminine graces and never looked back. When we fell for each other, we fell hard, and started talking marriage and family right away. 

We already had a business together, were already very close friends, and were already involved. So when we decided we were ready to call it love and make a future out of it, things got real fast. He has gone through so much personal growth this year. I know that my ability to use my femininity as a soft landing place for him has been instrumental. He went from a smart, talented, and kind person who was also a bit bitter and escapist, to an incredibly driven, hardworking man who is open to influence and is fixed on seeing things as they really are. He has some huge aspirations for life, and now he really believes he can achieve them. 

And once I had permission not to do the career path I was “supposed” to do, I found work that I really liked and broke through my unemployment slump with his support. I now have no problem admitting that although I have this advanced degree, my main calling in life is to be a wife and mother. I will work on the side to help the family or as a hobby, but my work will be far second to my true calling, and that’s okay. 

I am not an ideal bride by any means. And he’s not a perfect man. But we emphasize each other’s strengths, complement each other’s weaknesses, and are constantly striving to grow. Personal growth is a very RP, very anti-victimhood concept, and we could not have this relationship without it. We have a wonderful life ahead of us!

Thank you for helping to make this possible!

2unk1t,'You make me happy',"My SO is quite the oyster type: he doesn't like to talk about feelings. He shows his love through actions: he's always there for me, fixing things in my apartment, introducing me to his friends and family very early on etc.

I had a hard time adapting to that, because I love to bond with words: telling each other how much we love each other, talking about our relationship. Everytime I started doing this, I saw him feeling thoroughly uncomfortable and not knowing what to say.

Two days ago, we were at a party and I was so happy to be out there with him, proud to be with him, so despite me knowing he doesn't like it I started to say those things again.

Yet instead of saying 'I love you', this time I said 'You've made me so happy this year'.

The difference in reaction was amazing. Instead of not knowing where to look and changing the subject like he would usually do, his whole face lit up, he had a smile from ear to ear, pulled me towards him and said: 'Have I? god, you can be so sweet'.

I was so puzzled by his reaction, and so happy, like I've found his secret button to make him feel good.

I don't even know if it's RP or not, but I've been thinking it is. I think me saying 'you make me happy' kind of reinforces the idea of him being active in my life, him taking care of me and adding value to my life. As opposed to the supposedly unconditional 'I love you'.

Or am I reading too much into this?

2t6om7,The Gaming Analogy that shut my friends up with their judgments about me trying to be a RPW,"In the past few months, I've done really well incorporating a lot of what I've read on this sub and elsewhere on the internet into my relationship, and things have been going great! My friends have been a bit confused and rather judgmental though of me having my SO take the lead in our relationship. Finally, I appealed to the gamers in them to explain why I loved our new setup.

I play World of Warcraft, and in the game, there are different roles for dungeons and raids, like tank and healer. Generally, the tank leads the way in all of these scenarios with the healer's only job being to keep them and the rest of the team alive. Not only does it help make sure that everyone stays together, but then you don't have multiple people trying to decide that they know which way to go or what to do next.

In my relationship, my SO is the tank and I'm the healer. He leads me and I support him. That's not at all saying that I don't have the capacity to lead myself. If I was playing solo, I would still be able to survive, and I have knowledge of what we're doing, so I'll occasionally offer input if he needs it. But our two-person team works so much better when only one of us is making the decisions. 

They actually seemed to warm up to the idea a little after I explained it this way. I think they just always saw it as me giving up my autonomy because ""women aren't as smart as men"" or something similarly silly. But I think now they see that it's about being the best *team* possible.

2s300i,The Red Pill made me depressed. What did it do to you? Share your experience!,"Hello fellow RPWomen. I wish you the best for 2015.

There was a thread that said that the RP is much tougher to swallow for women, but it was pretty emotionless and impersonal, so I wasn’t satisfied. That's why I’m making a new thread where I’d like you to share your experience with the The Red Pill:

**1. What were you like pre-red pill?**

**2. How did you discover the red pill?**

**3. What has it taught you? How has it affected you negatively and positively?**

In this other thread I talked about, /u/blueWidow raised an interesting question that was not answered by anyone. I’d like that to be addressed here:

**4. How did you manage to come to terms with the harsh red pill truths without becoming jaded?**

The sidebar says that, for men, taking the red pill is like a grieving process::

1. Denial

2. Anger

3. Bargaining

4. Depression

5. Acceptance

I think it’s the same for women. I’m going through that process right now and I’m currently stuck at stage 4. And a little bit of 2.

I think that if I had found a testimony that described my experience on the internet, it would have helped me understand myself better and feel less alone. I'm writing this for people who need the help I needed and didn't find.

**Disclaimer:** When I say ""women/men are like this"", I speak about the vast majority, I understand that there are exceptions to the generalizations that I make.

**Here's my experience:**

I’m a low SMV female. I'm physically a 3/10. Because of bad genes, not because I let myself go.

I couldn’t get attention by looking nice, so I tried to work on my personality to be more attractive, but I don't have much going for me, so that didn’t work out well either. I spent most of my life as the awkward kid who struggled to make and keep friends, let alone boyfriends.

My only consolation back then was my hope that I would meet a guy who would love me despite my looks one day. I was an avid reader of feminist literature that said that behavioral sex differences are not innate, men like the same traits in women that women like in men, etc. and these ideas gave me hope that I could maybe still find a good partner.

But I also couldn’t help doubting that feminists (=females) were a reliable source about male preferences. So I searched the internet for male opinions and that's how I found the manosphere. It was anti-feministic so I found it very uncomfortable to read, but I couldn't turn a blind eye to the fact that the sexual strategies it promoted were effective. I spent days reading RP theory and I was surprised to discover what men were really like, not what mainstream culture said that they should be. I suspected that men and women were attracted to slightly different things, but I didn't expect that the differences were that big.

It turned out that women most importantly valued strong, confident, intelligent, driven leaders who made them feel safe and loved, as I already knew.

But men most importantly valued young, fertile, chaste, deferential, physically beautiful women who nurtured them and satisfied them sexually.

This sucked. I wished that this wasn’t reality, but it was and I was stuck in it and it sucked.

**Why did I hate that men are attracted to the things they’re attracted to?**

**Youth &amp; fertility &amp; beauty:** These features are so damn transient. We lose those no matter what we do. It's frustrating that our SMV depends on things we have almost no control over.

Fashion, dieting and exercise can help, but when you’re ugly, these things don’t make you beautiful, just maybe decent. I can pray to be saved by wife goggles, but still... so damn out of my control.

**Chastity:** This must suck for high libido women, but it was pretty easy to accept for me, because my sex drive is so low that I have close to zero interest in casual hookups anyway.

**Sexual satisfaction:** The problem is, the low sex drive would be a serious issue in a LTR. I knew that men had a higher drive, but not to the extent that RP taught me. RP made me aware of the fact that sex is a physical urge to men, they must have it often (either with a partner or alone). As a woman, arousal isn't as easy to stir, so I realized that I wouldn't be able to keep a man satisfied without regularly forcing myself to have sex that I’m not in the mood for just for him.

I found the idea of forcing myself to have sex like it's a chore so unromantic it was repugnant. That's not what mainstream culture says that married life will be like. Mainstream culture says that sex needs to be a special expression of love that's enjoyable for both partners, so if she's not in the mood, it's not happening and he should just respect that lest he objectifies her. The fact that RP contradicted this rubbed me the wrong way because RP desacralized sex.

I felt even more pressure after RP taught me that men need sex to feel close to their mate and not having it makes them feel painfully undesirable and not loved. I would feel loved and desirable just with cuddling, lots of hanging out together and occasional sex. It was hard for me to believe that this wasn't enough validation for men.

RP also taught me that sexual monogamy was a great struggle for a man. Even when in love with one woman, he fights the urge to have sex with many different women. And even when he's 50, his sexual preference remains set on the looks of 18 year old girls, so he can lose desire for his wife that he loves because she changed so much with age that she's too far from his natural standard. Mainstream culture says that he should desire the person he loves even after 40 years of being together, but apparently men just aren't wired that way.

I think that his personality would make him desirable to me even after he lost his looks with age and I don't have this need for sexual variety at all. The fact that my man would never be able to reciprocate such exclusive and long-term desire for me was another painful slap in the face of my romantic ideals.

**Nurturing:** That means being sweet, playful, receptive, sensitive, supportive.

I hated this because it’s a trait that is so easy to have.

Women's standards for a mate push men to be as powerful as they can be, but men's standards for a mate don't. They are low standards in comparison, which means that high SMV men have a myriad of high SMV women as options.

This RP truth made me feel insecure about my ability to keep a man, knowing that my high SMV man could very easily replace me with one of the many other women who fit his low standards. So much for feeling special.

**Deferential:** This one is about the Captain/First Mate dynamic that is advocated on here.

My problem with this was that I had trouble accepting the RP idea that women are naturally more attracted to nurturing roles while men are naturally more driven to go outside and conquer the world, as opposed to the feminist misconception that women and men are naturally the same in that regard. It explained why men have invented and built so much more. This truth was painful to accept because it makes me feel inferior to men.

As First Mates, we assume the supportive role while men are being CEOs, doctors, engineers, etc. And society values men for their achievements because only a limited number of people can do what they do. The male role is prestigious and elitist, whereas nobody stands in awe before the woman who does the child-rearing and the housework behind the curtains. Most people can do what she does, so society doesn't value her work. Value positively correlates with rarity. This led to the conclusion that, to society, feminine traits are inferior to masculine traits. (“value to society” =“societal value” from now on.)

As a woman, I hated this conclusion. Being of inferior societal value just felt humiliating and demoralizing.

The RP fact that men prefer feminine (=nurturing) women only added to this feeling of humiliation. It meant that women’s sexually valuable personality traits are traits that have inferior societal value than men’s sexually valuable personality traits. Feminism didn't raise me to be okay with that fact. It raised me to find the male preference for societally inferior traits in their mates demeaning, so that’s how I felt. Offended, degraded.

And to make things worse, it turned out that even I preferred mates that I'm inferior to. I was raised to want an equal relationship, but *my own body* betrayed me by responding more favorably to dominant, powerful men than to betas, so feelings of embarrassment and self-depreciation ensued.

When I encountered one of those chauvinist man-trolls on the internet who like to rub it into women's faces that they have superior societal value and they have it better because they're men, it got under my skin, but there was nothing I could say back because it was all true. It made me frustrated and jealous.

Yes, I began wishing that I was a man.

Because high SMV men have high societal and sexual market value and they hit the wall when they’re, what, 45?

Because even low SMV men don't have it so bad compared to low SMV women. They can work on their SMV whereas us, ugly girls, better luck out and find a male freak of nature who does not care about looks or we’re screwed.

Because feminism said that we “need men like fish need bicycles”, but RP taught me that it's actually men who don't need us as much as we need them. It's like nature designed men to be the self-sufficient high achievers and we’re the dependent sidekicks who they keep around just because we give them sex, babies, compliments to make them feel like goddamn superman and back rubs when they need a break from being awesome. They don't need romance to feel happy/complete in life, they only need sex that bad. And their SMV lasts longer than ours, so they have the power to leave us for a younger, higher SMV woman after 15 years of marriage. They won’t necessarily do it, but they can and we can’t. We're at their mercy.

What woman wants to hear that?

It’s not just RP's portrayal of men that I found strongly repulsive, women's portrayal was worse: flat out incapable of romantically loving an equal or inferior man, naturally more inclined to not be introspective, to be irrational, disloyal, selfish, fickle, to ""swing branches"" and to perform annoying shit-tests. RP men made us sound like unruly children that they have to put up with and keep in check with “Frame”. I had the emotional impulse to reject that unflattering portrayal, but I also knew that I had to accept that that’s reality. RP men have more experience with dating women than I have and they all agree on these things, so I assume that what they say about women's bad attitude in relationships is true, even though I don’t personally observe it.

Having said all this, I think I can safely conclude that pride/feeling humiliated is the biggest hurdle to swallowing the RP as a woman from a feminist culture. It might be difficult for you to sympathize with feminists, but their struggle is real (no pun intended). For some of them, denying gender essentialism and pushing girls to be more masculine is just a way to protect their self-esteem by proving that women have as much societal value as men. Their denial of reality has the potential to be annoying, but I can only feel compassion for them because I can relate so well.

I’m jaded. I'm in my late teens, but I already feel like I don't have much to look forward to.

I used to swoon over romance movies and dream of Everlasting Love. To me, love was this wonderful, transcendental, erotic power that connected two Soulmates and made their lives complete forever. Then I swallowed the RP and love was demoted to simple economics – callous talk about sexual markets, plates, orbiters, walls and primitive evolutionary instincts. The magic was gone.

And I know that I need to stop pity-partying and get the F over myself, but I can't get over it. I hate this reality. I hate the innate male/female difference. I'm stuck in stage 4. And a little bit of 2.

When I realized that I was wrong to put love on a pedestal, I considered giving up on LTRs altogether and being a WGTOW, but I doubt that I can be fulfilled in life just thanks to friendships and personal achievements, like a man can. I'm scared that if I do this, I’ll end up as a lonely, regretful old cat lady.

Not very appealing, amirite?


I'll see what the future holds...

**TL;DR your testimony: RP killed some of my romantic beliefs when it taught me how different men's sexuality was and how much less they crave love relationships with women than women do with them. It also taught me that male standards for a good mate are transient and relatively easy to meet. Easy standards means that men's mates are more easily replaceable and transient means that women's attractive power has an expiration date. Therefore I, as an ugly woman, think that my options are limited to:**

**1) Being with a high SMV man who will cheat/dump me for another female who is younger, prettier and less frigid at some point.**

**2) Settling for a secure relationship with a low SMV man that nobody wants and never having to worry about competition, but not being happy in that relationship.**

**3) Being insanely lucky and finding a man who will make me happy (and vice-versa) and find something special to love about me despite that I have so little to offer.**

**RP also taught me that sex differences are innate, so now I think that women are less valuable than men to society, because feminine traits are less ""societally"" valuable than masculine traits. It makes me wish I was a man. It feels humiliating and depressing for me to have low SMV and low societal value.**

**RP made me realize that my idea of love was an unrealistic fantasy. Laying bare all the rules and inner workings of the feeling stripped love of its magic and painted such a repulsive image of it that I became jaded. Now I consider being a WGTOW, but I doubt that this lifestyle will make me happy either. I don't know what I'll do.**

This was my emotional journey. I'd like to read about yours too. Maybe venting on here will make swallowing the RP easier for you, like it does for me, so feel free to be verbose.

Feel also free to comment on/criticize my ideas, but with tact please, because I meant no offense, just honesty. I've read texts in the past about the pain of swallowing the RP for women, but most had an aggressive undertone that said ""You don’t like it, huh? Well, deal with it, idgaf about your feeeels"" and that's more irritating than helpful. I think that tact, togetherness and compassion is much more conductive to emotionally accepting the bitter red pill, which is what this thread is about.

Thank you for reading. Especially if you read everything.

2rr0qj,The Hierarchy of Men,"I wrote [a post](/r/TheRedPill/comments/2rr0qa/the_hierarchy_of_women/) on TRP titled the hierarchy of women. **Please note,** TRP is a male-space; we do not use feminine language. The goal of the post was to help men differentiate between women that they encounter, place them into a strata, and then treat them accordingly. I thought a post for the ladies would only be fair.

###I. The Prince Charmings

These men are over six feet tall, dark, drop-dead gorgeous, endowed with broad foreheads, possess chiseled jawlines, rock six packs, make over $1,000,000 annually, are friends with socialites, are physically strong enough to push you down with one hand, are tender enough to warmly embrace you when your emotions get the better of you, have eyes for you and you alone, never cheat, possibly have slept with other women but committed only to you, masters of the culinary arts, can fix the car, do the dishes, do not put up with your whining yet genuinely listen to you when you are in a time of crisis, value you not for your body but for your intelligence, charisma, and personality all while being amazing in bed. 

These men have Ivy League degrees, work in a prominent STEM field and are CEOs. Naturally, they are knowledgeable enough to explain Einstein’s theory of General Relativity to you in a simple, easy to understand manner, yet they are also connoisseurs of the arts. As they walk you through art galleries, they distinguish Rembrant from Degas. Donned in three-piece tailored suits, at home in their mansions, they play Bach’s Cello Suites perfectly. While you sip their champagne from their wine collection, they proceed to play Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major on their ornate grand piano.

These men sweep you off your feet and leave you breathless when they waltz with you in the ballroom, and excite you when they rock-out at the disco. They have a library full of classics and a dedicated theater room. They live in area with sprawling gardens and nature, yet are only an hour away from a major city.

These men are willing to kill if it means protecting you. Their bodies are toned and rugged, capable of besting any man, woman, or any other being that gets in his way; however, he is skilled a diplomat capable of eloquently resolving conflicts without resorting to violence.

These men also enjoy giving oral.

**These men do not exist.** However, a good goal to have is to think of the man you are in a relationship with as your prince charming. If you are honestly able to convince yourself of this, then you really do love him.

###II. The Marriageable Men.

These men have just the right amount of alpha and beta traits. They can lead, they are responsible, they know how to manage finances, they know how to manage *you,* they take the relationship seriously, and they are not afraid of commitment. While not necessarily possessing the genetics of the roman gods, these men are physically attractive. In addition, they have amicable personalities and are not a burden for you to put up with.

You feel at ease with these men. They do not *mess up*; they act in such a manner that you do not resent them for the actions they take. You find it easy to love these men because they are loveable. They are like prince charmings in some ways: some are rich, some are tall, some have a pssion for science, others a passion for the arts. The difference is they have, one, two, three, or more flaws, major and/or minor, that you are able to overlook and forgive.

These men do not pester you for sex all the time … because they keep you attracted so the chemistry does not fade. You **want** to sleep with this man. They do not laugh at your mistakes, yet they maintain your attraction towards them by making you feel like a woman. These men are just the right mix of alpha fucks—as they are physically attractive and possess important alpha traits—and beta bucks—because they are caring and are financially able to provide.

Getting a marriageable man is not difficult, [but it does require work on your part.](/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2qt5th/tips_for_a_new_rpw_i_read_the_sidebar_but_i_still/cn9d9yj).

###III. The Alpha Fucks 

These men are attractive, or as you women would say, “cute.” They are confident, attractive, and tall. You notice them while you do your grocery shopping, when you are at the gym, and when you are simply walking outside. 

But why would you want a relationship with these men? Some of them are broke. Others have just too much alpha—they can be confident and assertive, but they do not care that your aunt just died. They do not have the time nor energy to listen to your problems. Chances are, to them, you are a plate.

They are not ideal relationship options, although highly dominant women will feel feminine with alpha fucks. It is possible for a strong alpha fucks/weak beta bucks man to be relationship material for high dominance women if he does not fail any important requirement for being in a relationship with.

### IV. The Beta Oribters. 

These are the men you friendzone. You know your friends that are just so gosh darn nice? The same ones you just cannot help but feel like are not relationship material? These are them. 

Beta orbiters try to win a woman through their wallet, by listening to all of women’s problems, by being an emotional tampon, and by always being there for women. But those things turn women off. 

Beta orbiters are too needy. They lack confidence. Even if you step back and let the man be a man and lead, he will not fare well. You almost feel like a mother when it comes to these men because they are not self-assured and seek guidance from you. You dominated them, grow to resent them, and feel contempt toward them. They are emasculated and do not know how to be masculine. They are not relationship material because you do not feel a shred of attraction towards them.

###V. The Invisible Men 

These men are about 80% of the male population to you (give or take 5%). They are not attractive. They are short. They have no ambition in life. They do not know how to treat a lady with respect and equality, and they certainly do not know how to make a woman feel like a woman in bed by acting dominant  and treating her submissively.

These men are a mix of betas and omegas. The betas here, as opposed to the beta orbiters in strata four are not even on your radar. You have never met them, you do not even know these guys’ names. You appreciate (or do you?) the men at the cash register, the garbagemen, the boilermakers, the coal miners, and the construction workers. But none of them are relationship material. Some do not make enough money. Others do not want a family. Others just are not attractive enough. Others are attractive, but they do not want to support your dreams of becoming a painter. Some men want to, but they do not want to help pay for your student loans. All in all, these men are too problematic.

The omegas are on a whole other level. Not only are they short, fat, and unattractive, these men are **really invisible to you.** Why? Because they do not even bother with women. They go play video games all day. They cannot for the life of them attract a woman. They go in front of a woman and stutter and twiddle their thumbs and do their best to muster “D-d-do y-you want, uh, um, to um l-like go on a d-d-d-date with me” and the poor woman cannot help but feel her vagina dry up like the Sahara Desert.

***

My advice to women in relationships is that they should try to think of the man they are in a relationship with as their prince charming. Of course it is not true, but doing this will help limit hypergamic tendencies. For single women, of course you should look to LTR and/or marry quality men. Do not settle, at least not for the sake of settling. Improve your SMV and MMV so you can get a guy in the second strata. 

**TL;DR** Prince charming doesn't exist, marriageable are almost perfect but have flaws, alpha fucks can be unstable and have trouble committing, beta orbiters aren't your first choice, and invisible men are completely unattractive. Also read the post.

2mba73,"Hi RPW, long time lurker, first time poster(long), field report about the effects of my behavior changes since finding the RPW.","I have to admit, the feminist and modern dating advice I've gotten from seemingly everywhere is terrible, it never worked, unless heartache is your goal. The advice I've gotten from here is beyond valuable though, I genuinely feel happier in my life and my relationship and I credit it to RPW. Cultivating a feminine frame a mind has made my man more rabid for me than ever. I was always sort of confused about how RPW establish a C/FM dynamic but once I started implementing the advice here, it established itself quite quickly. I realized that for the length of my relationship I'd been pushy, bitchy, and annoying and that the reason we were fighting so much was because of ME and my entitled mentality. 

Quick background on my guy. He's 3.5 yrs older than me, I'm 25, he recently got out of the military after serving for ten years. He's very much a good man, a natural leader, strong, tall, intelligent, pretty much alpha. which I love. But I honestly was at first kind of intimidated by, because it went against all the leftist indoctrination I'd be force fed from university, culture, etc. 

About four months ago I found RPW and made changes immediately. Some of the first things I did after reading RPW:

* Started going to sleep one hour earlier to ensure I could get 8 hours of sleep. 

* Waking up early enough to where I could make myself look good(and by extension feel good!) and start making breakfast for my man and I 

* Instead of telling my guy what I want to do, I started asking him ""I really want to know what you want, love, what do *you* want to do?"" This was from advice I found here, because I had been pushy it seemed he started second guessing his instincts to lead...

* No nagging, at all, ESPECIALLY before he goes to work, no fighting about the unimportant stuff with the idea that as I fix these behaviors the bigger issues will work themselves out

* Made sure that before my SO gets home I've made our bed, had dinner ready, and the house was cleaned, just so that when we're together *we can relax* and that this would also stop the bigger fights from bubbling up. 

* In an effort to save money, I began packing all of our lunches, and writing little love notes with super girly bubbly writing just so my guy will feel loved 

**The results**

Getting 8 hours of sleep has made me sexier. It's not in my head, I took pictures of before/after, I noticed that my skin has more radiance, it has a youthful glow and flush to it, and my laugh lines are almost invisible, late nights and little sleep really DOES take it's toll. It's also made me incredibly more relaxed throughout that day, and I feel like it just helped me be more stable between emotional peaks. 

When I started making breakfast for my guy he was a little confused, mostly because he was used to waking up by himself and eating cereal, but he's come to love me waking up with him. I notice that he's so much happier when he goes off to work because of *this little change* and that he can't help but tackle me when he gets home. It's taken stress off of both of us. It lets him sort of relax and wake up in the morning time while I fix us something to eat, he even will do sweet little things like embracing me while I'm working, or making us tea. 

With packing his lunches, it was something I could do in between fixing breakfast, and after cleaning up dinner the night before. I've been writing him small notes and packing homemade baked goods for him in his lunch, for the first month or so it was pretty normal, it didn't seem to make a huge difference, but months after the fact he proudly will come home now and talk about how his co-workers make comments about how he should ""marry that girl"", and that his friends at his office are envious that he has great food to eat. Sometimes I'll pack him extra stuff and he gives that to the people around him and they rave on my baking ability! This has had such a huge effect on our relationship that I can't believe I never did it, he seems really proud to be with me, if that makes any sense. The added bonus to this is the money we've saved... Ladies, we've saved SO MUCH by doing this, that this has greatly reduced random financial stress as well. Lately I've noticed that he will randomly buy me little gifts and he isn't worried about money so much anymore. 

When I say no nagging, I mean that I never ask him to help me clean up after he's worked all day, or I know he needs to relax. I notice instead that after a particularly great day, he'll just start helping me clean up after dinner unprovoked, I praise him and love him for this and as a result we are both happy. I've also made sure not to tout my efforts as something he should be grateful for, for example I don't say things like, ""I worked so hard today to make this food; You're so lucky you have me, most guys would want a woman that takes care of them like this"", I've seen women do this to their men before, and no one seems happy. I've noticed that *I don't need to anyway*, because it wasn't long before he will do it for me, he'll compliment my efforts and I just smile and kiss him and cuddle him and it makes us both happy.

By asking my man what *he* wants really helped establish the C/FM dynamic that I don't know how I ever lived without. I got this little piece of advice from here in a thread one day and started using it the day I found it. After a few weeks he began to just say what we were doing, and I would just go with it. I've noticed that when doing projects together, like assembling IKEA furniture, I just default to his ideas, and let him go. For some reason I never did this before, I guess because I didn't trust him? 
But I've discovered that by trusting him we are better off than ever. He seems to have SO MUCH more confidence and the ideas he comes up with and decisions he makes are really good *for us*, he seems accomplished and happy doing this, it's natural for him. Where before I was reluctant to give up that control of a situation he would second guess himself and then projects would turn into fights, by letting him make the calls he now will ASK me if he is unsure and request a suggestion, it's improved everything!!!! No more stupid fights about these things! Another thing is when giving my captain(I can call him that now!) a suggestion, it's always a suggestion, I'm sure to never tell him what to do, or undercut his decisions, but instead just contribute to them, and now we work completely together, it's for the best. 

Sex. All of these little things have added up to one huge critical factor. My man is hungry for me. I feel desired like I never have before, it honestly feels like that since taking care of these things, it's cleared up so much free time for him to not worry about these silly household things and now that intensity has been directed at me... in a good way ;) I'm terrible at talking about sex, but basically, ohhh myyy goddd. Good stuff. :)

---

This is literally the longest post I've ever written, but I HOPE that maybe some other lurker out there will see this, I WANT the ladies here to critique me and give me more advice or tell me what I can to do ever better, and I have to say THANK YOU, RPW... Thank you. 

I know that this man is the one who I want to spend the rest of my life with and the other day I glanced at him on his computer and noticed he had a tab on his computer that was titled ""wedding proposals"", if he proposes to me I will be the happiest lady ever. A month ago he randomly asked me about ring sizes... so. I need to stop rambling but yeah, it seems like the RPW philosophy *does work* because I'm happy, he's happy, and I'm finally getting the commitment and fulfilling relationship I've always wanted.

A beautiful example of what women should **not do,** solipsism in action, and how women typically will look to blame others rather than analyze their own behavior.

My goal in this post is to help RPW who are currently *seeking* a relationship not suffer the same fate this woman did. The fact is, as women, many of you *do* want to date/marry guys that have a stable job and is financially well off. I am not saying that you are all gold diggers; I am saying that a man who is financially well off, and possibly rich, is attractive to you and more attractive to you than men that don't. Please don't start giving me comments about how your life is different, because studies have shown this to be the case (a quick youtube search should give you a viral video about this topic). I am making a generalization.

That said, I want to touch on a couple of points we can take away from this.

1) If you honestly have a problem with the relationship you are in, you need to communicate to your partner and address those issues. This woman, in a passive-aggressive manner, shit tested her BF by breaking up with him and wanting him to reclaim her. You know that it was a shit test because just a few days later she messaged him. In short, she was still fixated on him, and tried to get him to chase after her. **Most men, especially not men like Will, will do this.**

2) The fact that she stated ""I'm not a golddigger"" tells me she is a gold-digger. As a man who has managed to save up quite a bit of money for someone in undergrad, this is the biggest red flag for me, and it is also a huge red-flag for a cousin and close friend of mine who are rather rich. My message to you RPW is that you need to understand a couple of different things:

2a) Life is not all about money.
2b) If you do choose to focus on his income/assets/wealth, you need to be honest with yourself and decide on what you want. If you don't like a man who is as frugal as Will is, then you need to find someone that better matches what your partner would be like. That said, keep in mind that the more demands you have (in particular financial demands), the smaller your date able pool becomes.

2hhg51,Girl Game - Guys' Night Out,"Tonight is Boys' Night for my husband, so I'm inspired to share some of my girl game moves.

I have two strategies for Boys' Night that I use as appropriate. Tonight is just the guys heading out for a drink and to watch the game, so I use **Strategy 1: Do Nothing**. That means that he leaves and I don't pester him with texts and phone calls. He's going to be home before I turn out the lights and probably just wants to immerse himself in testosterone before he heads back to his house full of females. This strategy also applies to after work happy hour.

However, there are other events, like bachelor parties and boys' weekends where I like to apply **Strategy 2: Just One Sext**. Basically, I either send a hot selfie, reminding him what's waiting for him at home, or I drop the raunchiest description possible of what's waiting at home. The key is that I hit Send, and then put down my phone. I don't badger him all night with text messages, I just put the idea in his head. Sometimes he wants to go back and forth with me a while, and I love to play along, but it's not expected.

Every once in a while I'll send him something hot when he's just out for a drink or two...but then again, sometimes I'll do that when he runs out to the grocery store! I think the important thing is that it is used as a treat for him, and not as his girl blowing up his phone because she's bored.

Anyway, this has received rave reviews from my husband, and I have some fun always trying to top the last thing I did. We've been married for quite a while, too, so also proof that things don't have to get boring just because the relationship has some years on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2hhg51/girl_game_guys_night_out/,1411692471.0,62,0.95,19,RedPillWomen,HappySnowGirl
2h32ao,It finally clicked!,"Hi everyone! As some of you might know, I'm pretty new to RPW and I've spent most of my brief time here as a lurker. During that time, I found a lot of things on this sub that really connected with my personal beliefs, but other things that left me confused and perhaps a little bit indignant. But I realized this was normal and that it was up to me to figure things out for myself. Now, though, I'm having those lightbulb moments where things just fall into place in my head, which I'm so excited about. I wanted to share some of my thoughts on my realizations and hopefully stimulate some conversation :)

Out of all that I read, there was this one specific post that bothered me and kept tripping me up. I'll quickly summarize: OP said that both she and her SO were extremely jealous people and that she was desperate for solutions. Some of the wiser, more experienced users on this sub were saying that OP should view other girls eyeing her SO as assurance of the high quality of her SO, which should incite her to better herself. They also said OP should stop hanging around the men that made her OP so jealous. OP responded back that she didn't understand why she had to change when her SO didn't. When I first read that, I still had a lingering mindset that was shaped by the feminist-society we live in, and so agreed with OP. The post popped back into my head today, and the rationale of the users who responded finally made sense!

I know a lot of the older users on this sub say things like ""don't live tit for tat"" and while I sort of understood that before, I think it only truly clicked today. See, what I realized was that in a relationship, it doesn't matter who has to change, the only thing that matters is that *the problem gets solved*. Let me just say that again because I think it's so important: *the only thing that matters is that the problem gets solved.* 

Who cares if you're the one who has to change? If the relationship means enough to you, you shouldn't be upset that *you're* the one making the so-called ""sacrifice."" And that's what made me feel so lost, the fact that you have to totally readjust how you think when you're in a relationship. You have to go from focusing on ""what's in my best interest"" to ""what's in *our* best interest.""

The thing is, if you've chosen a good man, you won't always be the one making the change. When you realize something is wrong, you'll need to be the one who changes and readjusts your attitude. That's only to be expected, though, because other times he'll be the one seeing issues and making changes and sacrifices you might not even notice. Relationships are all about a give and take, with each person contributing in different, but equally important ways, to build up something neither of you could create alone.

At first, it's hard to transition from the mindset that oh, as women we have to make sure that ""our men respect us"" and that we're never, ever viewed as wrong, but that's exactly the mindset that gets us into so many problems in the first place! I realize now that I've been viewing relationships from such a flawed, selfish view. The mindset I had might work for short-term flings, but it's not at all appropriate for anything meaningful and long-term.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, as a new user, there's a lot of things that bombard you all at once. At first, it's overwhelming to take in, and you're going to disagree with a lot. But that's only to be expected! The important thing is not to dismiss it immediately just because you don't agree with it yet, but to learn more about it. Everything on this sub might not work for you, but that's no reason to get frustrated or discouraged! In order to better ourselves, we have to first absorb as much knowledge as possible and try them out in order to then properly pick out what will be useful for our particular situation. I hope anyone who's on the newer side and is reading this gets at least a little bit encouraged to reread some posts that bothered them and think about it in a new light :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2h32ao/it_finally_clicked/,1411348511.0,60,0.93,26,RedPillWomen,hawthornevine

I went to A Good School, got my bachelors, my masters, went to Another Good School and got my Ph.D.  Completely 100% focused on My Career.  I dated.  Not much, but had a couple of long term relationships through college.  Both with men who didn't really want to lead, but that was OK, because I was In Control And In Charge.

Post-Ph.D I left a long term relationship because he didn't want me to move to the USA, but didn't want to give me long-term commitment.  I spent my first 3 years in the USA without a relationship, being Strong Independent Career Woman.  

When I met my husband, D, I was a year post-breakup with a man who couldn't separate work and home, and I'd pretty much resigned myself to not ever getting married.  D is very RP, and even though he didn't use that terminology with me, I realize now that that is what he is. 

We fell in love just as I lost my job, and he asked me to marry him.  As he put it 

&gt;I love you, and I can see a future that is the two of us together.  Marry me and together, we'll build a future so bright, we'd never have imagined it possible on our own.

I said yes, but ""informed"" him that I intended to keep my maiden name.  He was upset, but I was adamant, pointing out that ""I'd worked hard under this name"".  This was our first RP battle.  His response? 

&gt;We are going to be married.  A couple, a family unit.  Where we both work *together* for the betterment of our family. For the betterment of us. I promise you that any decision I make about us will always be with our best interests at heart.  I love you, I want the world to know that I love you and that we are in this life for the long term together.  What better way than to present a united front with our names?

I acquiesced, and D told me that this made him so happy, he literally had a tear in his eye.  That the woman he loved was willing to put aside ego and work for the betterment of us.  I was blind, and saw it as ""his"" victory.

Wedding planning was insane.  I was the one who wanted a courthouse ceremony and no fuss.  D wanted the whole nine yards.  We got the whole nine yards.  D gave me a vision of what he wanted, and told me that as I had time on my hands, I would implement it, making sure that the small stuff was taken care of, and the big things he wanted input on were presented to him in a manner that he got to make the decision, fully informed.  

I resented the crap out of this.  I wanted to do things my way.  D told me that the first hint of Bridezilla behavior, and he'd put me over his knee and spank me, and not in any sort of happy fun way, either. That this was *our* wedding, and he would, if I trusted him, make sure we had a wedding to remember.

I have to admit, I cried like a little girl through some of this.  Including temper tantrums when he didn't like something I'd worked on, or if I disagreed with him.  D, somehow (yes, that man has the patience of a saint or something!) didn't break off our engagement or even engage my tantrums.  He met my tantrums with frame.  Refusing to discuss things till I was calm and rational, and not giving in to what I now realize was emotional manipulation.

And what he told me, shook me.  

&gt; Do you trust me? If you trust me, why are you arguing with me?  Do you not think that I will do what is right by us?  We are about to be married.  Trust me.

I cried myself to sleep in his arms that night.  The realization that here I was, I had a good man, one who loves me, who tolerated my bs, who simply wanted the best for us.  And what was I doing?  I was being childish and selfish.  Putting my needs and wants above his; needs and wants he had told me that he would only ever desire for the best of us.  I knew I had to change. 

Its been a challenge, this past year.  I read the RPW stuff religiously, tried to implement it.  Ran around like a headless chicken sorting out the wedding, getting stuff done, and best of all, trusting the man who was about to become my husband.  I smiled through it, even though I was tired, and grumpy on the inside.  But trusted my husband that we'd get through it.

Post wedding, things got tough.  One of our major consulting clients went through a rough patch and didn't pay us on time.  Took us far too long to get green card paperwork in due to a lack of money, so I couldn't work.  When the possibility of a DreamJob came up, it was in a city D refused to countenance to even live in.  We argued.  Someone here told me to listen to what my husband was saying, and why he was saying it.  I did, but wasn't 100% convinced he was right.  

But, I decided, I married him.  I have to trust him. So, I trusted him to captain our ship to better waters, and withdrew from that job.  

Once the green card arrived, and I started job hunting feverently, I found that it was taking longer than we thought it would.  I was, I thought, being a good wife in the meantime:  job hunting, taking care of the house, making sure dinner was ready when D came home from a job he hated that he had to do to keep a roof over our heads.  And it came to a head, again.  He lashed out at me, and we were heading to a big argument.  About a week ago in fact.  Just when i thought I was being a good RPW and doing everything ""right"".

This time though, I had RPW and my best friend, K, at my back.  RPW told me that he had a point, that things were tough for him, that he hated his job, and yes, I didn't have one, so couldn't contribute to the household, and I should, somehow fix that.  

K, though, was like a goddess, sent from above. She patiently, through my tears, told me that yes, he's angry and upset and frustrated, and he has every right to be, because things are crappy right now.  But the worst thing I could do would be to escalate.  Let him take out his frustration, and then pick through the rants, figure out the problem, and the two of us, as a team, find a creative solution to it.

I spoke to him that night.  Told him that it was killing me to see him so frustrated and angry, but given it would be a couple more months before the DreamJob happened, I asked how could I make it better immediately.  He told me the financial pressure was unbearable, particularly as he hated the job, and they kept cutting hours.  

I cried and vowed to fix it. 

I'm getting the bus to a temp job starting Tuesday.  I've made sure the house is clean, so that once I go to work, I don't put the pressure of my chores on him instead of the financial pressures, as he still has to work the job he hates till my DreamJob happens.  Once we have more money coming in, I'll be cooking freezer or crockpot meals so he has dinner ready when he gets home and leftovers for work.  I vowed that he would be the husband of my days, my love and the center of my world.  Its time I put it in action.

My husband looks at me again the way he did on our wedding day, he's relaxed, and happy.  He holds me in his arms and refuses to let me get out of bed.  He play fights with me again, tickling me till I'm in tears and can't breathe from laughter.  I have my husband back.

This is where a year of struggling, married to an RP man has brought me.  I have struggled with my ego.  I learned to place my ego in check.  To put my husband's feelings before my own (not out of martyrdom, but because his happiness matters to me.  I can't be happy if he's not), to listen to what he's telling me, and hold my frame, just as he holds his.  I realized, we're not competitors, we're a team.  And any team needs a leader, to do well.  He is my leader, and that leads me to the most important thing of all:  *Trust*.  Trust that what my husband is asking of me is for the best for our future.  Not just saying that I trust my husband, but *showing* him that I do.

I still have a career (or am hoping to, anyway!), but at the same time, at home, within our relationship, it doesn't matter.  The money all goes into the same bank account anyway, so what does it matter how it got there?  He is my love, my captain, and I trust him now to make decisions that are right for us.  He asked me to get a temp job to help out in the meantime, I have.  He wants me to work a decent job, putting the education to use, so that he has time to start a homestead and grow our own food, etc?  I will. 

This is no longer about me vs him.  Its about Us vs the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2err1z/the_red_pill_1_year_later_or_how_i_went_from/,1409180233.0,52,0.75,21,RedPillWomen,DelphineSerafine
2cvqgh,The Five Respect Needs of Men,"http://www.imom.com/the-five-respect-needs-of-men/

`1`. Respect his judgment
The men were really touchy about this. A man deeply needs the woman in his life to respect his knowledge, opinions, and decisions—what I would call his judgment. No one wanted a silent wallflower (not would I advocate that!), but many men wished their mate wouldn’t question their knowledge or argue with their decisions all the time. It’s a touchy (and difficult) thing in these liberated days, but what it rea3lly comes down it is their need for us to defer to them sometimes.

Several men confessed that they felt like their opinions and decisions were actively valued in every area of their lives except at home. Some men felt that their comrades at work trusted their judgment more than their own wives did. Also, while a man’s partners or colleagues will rarely tell him what to do (they ask him or collaborate on the decision instead), more than one wife has made the mistake of ordering her husband around like one of the kids.

`2`. Respect his abilities
Another strong theme that emerged was that men want—even need—to figure things out for themselves. And if they can, they feel like they have conquered something and are affirmed as men. For some reason, spending hours figuring out how to put together the new DVD player is fun. Problem is, we want to help them—and guess how they interpret that? You got it: distrust. (It’s a wonder any relationships work and that the human race didn’t die out millennia ago!)
And, of course, our attention is not all benign. Sometimes we truly don’t have confidence that our man can figure something out on his own.

The little things equal one big clue
We don’t realize that the act of forcing ourselves to trust our men in little things means so much to them, but it does. It’s not a big deal to us, so we don’t get that it’s a big deal to them. We don’t get that our responses to these little choices to trust or not trust—or at least act like we do!—are interpreted as signs of our overall trust and respect for them as men.

A man might think of it like this: If she doesn’t trust me in something as small as finding my way along a road, why would she trust me in something important, like being a good breadwinner or a good father? If she doesn’t respect me in this small thing, she probably doesn’t really respect me at all.

The next time your husband stubbornly drives in circles, ask yourself what is more important: being on time to the party or his feeling trusted. No contest.

`3`. Respect in communication
Women hold an incredible power in the way we communicate with our men (both husbands and sons) to build them up or to tear them down, to encourage or to exasperate.
Some things just push a man’s buttons. This goes beyond what we say—such as questioning a man’s judgment or his abilities—and into how we say it (and where we say it, which is the subject of the next section).

The disconnect
In my interviews, a large number of men said something like this: “When my wife says something disrespectful, I often think, I can’t believe she doesn’t know how that makes me feel!” I had to reassure these men over and over that their wives probably didn’t mean to disrespect them and were likely just clueless.

Let me give you several common examples of how a man might hear something negative where the woman never intended it.

Hearing disrespect
Not long ago, I was asking Jeff and one of his married colleagues about the dynamic of men wanting to do things for themselves. This man said, “Something, if something breaks in the house, I want to try to take a crack at it before I call an expert. If my wife says, ‘Well, you’re really not a fix-it-type person,’ I feel so insulted. She’s not rude about it or anything, but it’s like she doesn’t respect me enough to believe that I can figure it out if I put my mind to it, even if it takes me a while.”

Hearing disappointment
In a survey—as in life—a sizable minority of men read something negative into a simple female reminder. I asked men what would go through their minds if their wife or significant other reminded them that the kitchen wall was damaged and it still had to be fixed. More than one-third of these men took that reminder as nagging or as an accusation of laziness or mistrust.

Crank up that filtering system
No matter what we think we are saying, in the end, what matters is what the guy is hearing. Obviously, some people can be overly sensitive, and we can’t walk on eggshells all the time. Nor do we want to pass up all opportunities to help them understand our communication writing.

After all, don’t we want our husbands to adjust to our sensitivities? Do you want your husband to publicly tease you about gaining ten pounds? It’s all about loving each other the way the other persons needs to be loved. Even as we help our husbands understand that we have a learning curve on this, we should make every effort to filter our words through a “disrespect meter” before they pass our lips.

`4`. Respect in public
Now we come to one of the most important points of the book. There appears to be an epidemic of public disrespect for men, and the biggest culprit is not the television, movies, or other media, but the women who are supposed to love their men most.

The most fragile thing on the planet
Dozens of men told me how painful it is when their wives criticize them in public, put them down, or even question their judgment in front of others. One man on the survey said that they one thing he wished he could tell his wife was that “at a minimum, she should be supportive of me in public.” That wish was repeated dozens of times on the survey—it was one of the strongest themes that emerged.

Consider this statement, which I have heard (in essence) from many men: “My wife says things about me in public that she considers teasing. I consider them torture.”

Be respectful even when he’s absent
Having seen how important public respect is to men (it is almost impossible to overstate), I have become incredibly sensitive to how often we might talk negatively about them behind their backs. The effects are much the same even when a man isn’t present: The women’s disrespect of her husband becomes even more deeply embedded as she harps on it, and those in listening range may begin to feel the same!

Showing public respect goes a long way
Just as your man will be hurt and angry if you disrespect him in public, he will think you are the most wonderful woman in the world if you publicly build him up.

Trust me—from the men I’ve talked to, that will be the equivalent of his coming home to you with a dozen roses and a surprised date night without the kids. He will feel adored.

`5`. Respect in our assumptions
Unfortunately, in one area men have every right to read something into what we say—and that is when we have jumped to negative conclusions about them. When we really examine our communication, we’ll be astounded at how often is assumes something bad about the man we love. See if any of these assumptions ring a bell.

We assume, “He needs to be reminded”
To us, repeatedly asking “Have you done it yet?” is probably not a big deal. But inherent in the question is our assumption that the guy needs the reminder—that he is either incapeable of remembering on his own or that he remembers just fine but needs our prodding to do the job. What they are accurately hearing is “I don’t trust you.”

Just realize that his reason for not doing it may be different from yours. Remember, half the men on the survey indicated that sometimes they just have different priorities. OR they could just be unable to handle one more thing. One man with a stressful job noted that he sometimes feels like a computer that will crash if he tries to load one more thing onto it. For him, procrastinating on something his wife wants him to do at home is his warning sign that he will emotionally crash is he tries it.

We assume, “He’s choosing not to help”
One experienced female marriage counselor gave me this example: “If my husband doesn’t help with the kids or the cleaning, I shouldn’t assume that he sees it and is choosing not to help. I should start with the assumption that he doesn’t see it.”

We assume, “It’s because of him”
Finally, sometimes something is not his fault—it’s ours. Sometimes we assign unloving motives to our men that could actually be traced back to something we have inadvertently said or done. For example, a wife who is constantly critical of her husband may spur him to withdraw emotionally to protect himself, thereby becoming unloving where he wasn’t before.
“Men are not stupid,” says Dr. Eggerichs. “They are not Neanderthals. Sometimes these behaviors that appear to be unloving are not unloving at all. They are reacting that way because they interpret something as disrespect. Even if something they shouldn’t.”

289cru,The sub has changed me and inspired me to become a better woman. These theories and ideals WORK.,"I feel very lucky to have found this sub while I am still young (18 years old.) It has seriously taught me so much. I used to be a mess...a loud, obnoxious, smoking teenager with neon hair, piercings and ripped clothes. I partied and smoked pot. I ate horribly. I had no confidence and was a bitter person.

This sub opened my eyes. It has transformed me into a pleasant, amicable woman. I have since then dyed my hair, started wearing feminine clothes, stopped drinking, and just recently shredded my cigarettes into the garbage. I have embraced my submissive nature, and have become more soft spoken and feminine. I have also started working out, lifting and eating well. 

At first when I found this sub, I was angry. I thought it was stupid, misogynistic...you know the drill. But I became obsessed with it. I read it every day. And eventually, all of the truths started to hit me, and I realized what I had to do. That I had to accept it and use it to shape myself into a better person.

This change has done nothing but good things for me. It has even helped me strengthen my relationships with my family and friends.

The wishy-washy, demotivational messages of feminism and modern lifestyles would never give me the kind of confidence and happiness that this subreddit has provided for me.  

I just want to thank all you great ladies (and men!) for persevering with this subreddit. It gets a lot of hate, and always will. People misunderstand it's message and get angry at its ideas, no matter how true they are. But it will remain. My success and joy shows how much of an amazing, inspirational, and truthful place this is.

So I just want to encourage you guys to keep on going through, no matter how much hate and bitter slander you guys receive. Because in the end, we are the ones that will continue pursuing fact, not fiction, when it comes to our lives and relationships. And we will come out stronger.

27v3h7,This sub - wow.,"In all my 3+ years of casually lurking Reddit, this sub is the only one that has inspired me to post.

To finally find a community of other females who actually think the way I do..well, relief isn't quite the right word to describe how it's made me feel but it will have to do. I've spent years trying to reconcile how I see reality around me with what other females, the media, western culture etc tout as the way to be happy (as a woman).

When I look back at my past, my behaviour and choices are so clearly explained by TRP that it's astounding. TRP knew me better than I knew myself at the time. I didn't know there was a name for it.

Lately I've been deeply troubled trying to reconcile my desire to give up my career, leave it behind in the dust and focus solely on starting a family. I'm fairly successful, have worked hard to get to this point and my whole life I have been told that career, self-sufficiency and financial freedom is the goal. 

However, I've recently married a great man and just admitted to him that all I want to do is make him happy and give him children. It was by far the most vulnerable I have ever felt in my life...and he loved it!
I always thought the personality traits he loved in me included my above average intelligence and ability to succeed at (most) things I commit to. Now I realise that may be true, but what's wrong with wanting to be the best 'first mate' I can possibly be? I can now measure my success (and sense of fulfillment) in different terms.

So thank you RedPillWomen, for making me feel no shame in putting aside my career and placing the needs of my husband and future family  above all else.

And now I have this place to inspire me towards self-improvement in other ways!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/27v3h7/this_sub_wow/,1402477874.0,83,0.94,17,RedPillWomen,Kinned

2452lo,[RANT] I'm Getting Bullied By Tumblr Feminists," Okay, so I have this tumblr blog. I have always made sure to stay far, faaaar away from the feminist and social justice warrior side of the site. It's a personal one, I post art there and some ramblings from time to time. Yesterday, I made a small post about being a virgin, and how I can't wait to start having sex. 

Then I received an anonymous question:


&gt; Aren't you too old to be a virgin in your twenties? If you want to have sex so much then why don't you just hook up with someone?


Okay, innocent enough question. I answered with this:


&gt; I want my first to be with someone I'm comfortable and relaxed with, and whom *at the very least* dating. I can't sleep with a stranger because it's super risky, and I won't be able to enjoy it because of my self-consciousness.


I thought that was a safe answer. I logged out and went to bed. When I woke up, I had 87 messages in my inbox. 

Holy shit. 

EIGHTY FUCKING SEVEN. 

And they were all hate mail! 

I started reading through them, and they were all regarding my answer to that virginity question! Some examples were:


* You're a fucking slut shamer, you know that? 
* God, what a prude. And you say you're an atheist!
* ""Oh look at me, I'm complaining about being virgin but I don't want to sleep with strangers, that's slutty!"" God, get your head out of your ass you slut shamer.
* You're an idiot, waiting for prince charming to take away your v-card. You're not special.
* Oh so what, you're too good for one night stands? What a fucking prude.
* Lol the internalized oppression is strong in this one.


And my favorite:


* No one wants to fuck you because you're a fat slut shamer. - this was said by a fat activist who weighed 250lbs


I have never been so insulted in my life. I stayed this way partly because of incel, though I have and still am fixing myself, I feel like crying because I feel like a freak for being a virgin in my twenties (forgive the hamstering). It's infuriating that these women would encourage young girls to fuck around while shaming and bullying the ones who refuse to, while asking other feminists to join in on the bullying and shaming! 


I'm just soooo angry and sad right now. I only came here to rant because I know that this is one of the few feminist-free spaces here in the internet. 


 **EDIT:** My hate mail is now in the hundreds. It's kinda sad now really. Some people that had reserved some commission slots have now backed out because of this fiasco, and that they believed that I was in the wrong.
