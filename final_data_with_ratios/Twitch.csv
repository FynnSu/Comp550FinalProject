o33xul,"Twitch is allowing sexually suggestive content against their own ToS, and allowing said streamers to advertise their private porn to minors"," I never thought much about what Twitch allowed/didn't allow until yesterday I noticed my 14 year old brother watching a Twitch stream where a girl was literally spread eagle with her private area pointed straight at the camera, which is completely against Twitch's own terms of service, while twerking, and simulating giving head sounds and licking motions, calling it ""asmr"". Besides the fact the entire stream, being viewed by over 20,000 people, most of whom are likely minors, is blatantly sexually suggestive, the channel is bombarbed repeatedly with links to the streamers Onlyfans account where she basically sells porn of herself to her mostly minor viewerbase.

And she's just one of an entire community who is suddenly doing this fad 'meta' as they call it on twitch of doing streams like this while clearly soliciting their own pornography. If I'm not mistaken it's obviously against most, if not all, state statutes to solicit porn to minors. So not only are these individual streamers liable, but twitch as an entity for clearly allowing it.

This is supposed to be a site where livestreamers can show off their daily lives, play video games, chat with each other, etc; it is NOT meant to be, in explicit terms of Twitch's own ToS, a sexual streaming service; yet they are allowing my 14 year old brother to view sexual content and be bombarbed by links to pornography.

Thanks so much for all your comments and votes 💜



Long message but I feel this needs to be said

&amp;#x200B;

I've been an avid and respectful Twitch user for almost 7 years. My viewing consists almost entirely of gaming and family-targeted animal streams, and in the last year I've discovered the joy of using my subscription and bits to gift to a children's cancer research hospital, and having the pleasure of watching my gifts trigger feeds for the animals. All this time, I have had the same username.

&amp;#x200B;

The username came from an XBox Live subscription I made over a decade ago. I had no idea what name to pick, so tried the username generator - what it suggested had a feminine touch, but also an edginess which might help me ""fit in"" better. To me, the username means ""cool, in control female emperor"". I decided it was a good name to choose.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately followed the instructions to the letter. There has been no response whatsoever to this appeal. I also contacted Twitch via their Twitter feed, Twitchsupport twice, again asking for help, and an opportunity to change my username. I have seen them reply to a large number of messages - almost everyone who has contacted them in fact - but I have not received a single reply to my request for assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have no idea whether my username is, in fact, somehow offensive. I have a protected characteristic, which, without going into detail, means I am often unaware of social conventions and the ""unwritten rules"" that everyone takes for granted people understand. In the UK at least, companies have a responsibility to ensure they are not giving a person with a protected characteristic a lesser opportunity than others when providing a service to them. As I cannot get any response from Twitch, I cannot open a dialogue with them to discuss this. I believe I have done nothing wrong, yet my opportunity to use the service has been terminated immediately, with full force, and without any opportunity at all to make an appeal heard and discuss my situation with them. Certainly, they have made no attempt to adjust any of their actions to ensure my use of their service is fair, given my difficulties.

&amp;#x200B;

I am absolutely devastated. Twitch has, for at least the last year, become very important to me. Watching the gaming and animal streams has become a refuge from the sorrows and challenges life presents, and has, until now, always helped to cheer me up. Through watching streams where other individuals with similar interests can chat, I have made several good friends, something which I still find very difficult to do normally. I had even started to help watch over some of the family-oriented channels, alerting mods where I felt inappropriate or abusive behaviour had begun to occur. I felt part of a ""family"". The day I received the email from Twitch, I cried for the whole day, and, dramatic as it may sound, I feel as if a part of my life has been torn away from me. Everyone who has spoken with me about this agrees that Twitch has over-reacted, and is acting unfairly. That's certainly how it seems to me, too, especially considering the large number of posts scattered across the Internet from Twitch users who have been given a similar thing, and, years later, have also had no opportunity to resolve the issue. Most appear to have gone on to create a ""second account"". I refuse to do that; it's against the Community Guidelines, and, despite the accusation I have somehow broken these, I have always striven to stay well within them. It's not my style to ""circumvent"" requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is to be a member of the Twitch community again; to chat with my Twitch friends, and to join in with the fun comments whilst watching my favourite streams. I want the opportunity to change my username, as I would have done in a \_heartbeat\_ had anyone from Twitch ever asked or told me to do so. I want to be able to trust that if I ever did decide to change my username, not only would it be checked and I would be informed if there were an issue with what I had chosen, but I would be treated fairly if somehow I ended up with a name which was, in any way at all, and in any language or culture, offensive. Everyone who has spoken with me about this has made the same comment: ""Why didn't Twitch just force a name change on you?"". That is a question I would very much like answered, if not for me than for the other Twitch users whom this will surely continue to affect. Twitch has a 3-strike system. Could my username not have been changed to something generic (""user12345"" for instance), and, if my existing name was really that bad, a strike been given to my account to alert me? I repeat this again to make it clear: I would have changed my username \_immediately\_ had anyone made me aware it was offensive to the Twitch community. Even if I cannot see these things myself, I am always open to listening to the guidance of others.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself now cut-off from Twitch, with no way of alerting them that it was impossible for me to see the transgression they have accused me of, and with no way of making my voice heard, or opening a dialogue with them to try to correct this. Twitch, if you're reading this, look at my activity; you'll see I have done nothing to harm your service, or community. All I want to do is join in with everyone else, and under a username you feel is appropriate. Can you \_please\_ just speak to me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/nz2ws5/banned_for_a_username_ive_used_for_7_years/,1623609755.0,1156,0.92,102,Twitch,General_Painter3265
lxpil8,I feel awkward receiving “big” donations. How do you thank people?,"Ok, this is going to be a dumb question. Yesterday a random person came into my art stream and donated $50 and gifted subs to people. To me that’s a lot of money. He didn’t follow me after or stay in the stream. I said thank you and I really appreciate it, but maybe I didn’t thank them hard enough or show enough excitement? Did I chase them away? I’ve also had people who like to gift like 10-15 subs at once and I feel so awkward when it happens. I thank them during the stream and if I have their discord I thank them again in DM. If I don’t have their discord I thank them again in the next stream they come into. Is this enough?

Edit: thanks for advice. And I am a very small stream so donations/gifting don’t happen that often for me. When they do I’m so grateful and happy but also weird about it",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/lxpil8/i_feel_awkward_receiving_big_donations_how_do_you/,1614877547.0,1160,0.97,132,Twitch,dietcokesweetie2

lx4ssy,Please do not announce lurkers,"I feel like this shouldn't have to be said, but, please don't announce to the world when a new person enters the stream who hasn't even said a word. I know you can see all the users on Mod View, but some of us just want to watch/listen and not interact.

It has happened to me a few times when I'll tune in to someone's stream and they immediately go ""oh look &lt;my username&gt; is here! How are you doing, how's your mother, how's your dog, yada yada"" and then I feel uncomfortable because I feel obligated to respond when I had no intention of speaking and just wanted to lurk.

It's perfectly fine to be friendly and welcoming, and there's no problem with streamers addressing the chat as a whole (or people who are chatting), but please do not call out specific users in the chat who haven't even spoken yet. It can make it very awkward for people who just want to lurk and don't want to chat.

Thank you.

EDIT: I understand not everyone may feel this way. Maybe some people like being addressed without ever having said something in someone's chat. But I feel like if you want to be talked to, then you can initiate it by just typing something in the chat. And if you don't want to be talked to, you shouldn't feel forced to by the streamer.

EDIT2: Wow, thank you everyone for the response! I had no idea this would take off like this and I do appreciate your thoughts. After reading/responding to the replies, I feel like I should clarify a few things:

1. It is perfectly fine to address lurkers/viewers as a group and to welcome them. Like ""oh I see we have some new viewers, welcome in everyone! Hope you are all doing well"" - that's cool. But singling someone out by their username when they haven't said a single word - not cool.

2. I am not saying that you shouldn't engage with viewers; you can ask questions to the chat, welcome them, and even thank the lurkers for being there. All I'm suggesting is to not call someone out by name who may not want to engage and just watch, or maybe is doing schoolwork and has you on for background noise. If someone wants to talk, then they can post in the chat. Until then, they should be allowed to lurk in peace.

3. ""Streamers shouldn't have to conform themselves to meet your preferences"" - I am not the only one who feels this way (as indicated in the comments), and while it's true that you can't accommodate everyone, I feel that this is a small thing to ask. I'm not saying to completely change your personality here, just to be cognizant of potential discomfort that can arise from engaging with a viewer who doesn't want to engage. If you want to ignore that, okay, but more often than not I have heard people who immediately leave when they have that happen to them. And if you're not streaming for the viewers, then who are you streaming for?

4. ""If you wanna lurk, then just don't respond"" - Ok, but it can be very off-putting to be called out by name when you don't want to be addressed, even if you don't respond.

5. Follow Notifications - I think it's fair to address someone who follows you, as this is the norm. Thanking them and welcoming them to your community. But remember that they are new, and they still may prefer to watch rather than chat. 


It seems the majority of the people here agree with me to an extent, so please just be mindful of others in your streaming endeavors and let the lurkers lurk.

lwoc68,Fake donos,"I’m not sure what to use as a flair? I think PSA. 

But anyways, Be careful on fake donations. Fake donations are usually in chat and made with some color text thing? If you don’t hear/see your notification for donos go off, it’s likely a fake donation. 

I’m a small streamer who just started a few days ago and on my stream, someone “donated” me $200. Naturally, I got excited and they got a huge reaction out of it. After the stream I figured out it was fake and I got really upset. 

I mainly stream to make money so me, my mom, and my brothers can get out of a bad situation. So learning that the dono was fake kinda hurt a lot. Please be cautious of fake donos.

lu7bmy,"Please stop feeling sorry for yourself about bad stats, and instead try to work on improving your content.","Something I've noticed a lot on this sub recently is the posts that are basically people feeling sorry for themselves because they have 1-3 viewers after over a year of streaming and some even blaming it on ""the algorithm"" or ""bad luck"". I am not denying luck plays a big part in twitch, but if you are on 1 viewer after over a year of streaming, you're doing something wrong.

And it isn't just the posts that ruin the experience of this sub for me, it's the comments. Someone can be talking about their positive experience on twitch, and the comments will just be full of people feeling sorry for themselves. I saw a post a month or two ago about someone saying they were so happy they got a large donation, and there were comments passive-aggressively saying things like ""Must be nice having viewers that would donate"" . Or a post about someone reaching affiliate within a few weeks of streaming, you'll see comments like ""I've been streaming for 10 months and only just reached 30 followers"" (without even congratulating the person) followed by replies parroting Harris Heller saying ""Make a YouTube channel"" or my favourite buzzword, ""networking"".

lswqnk,Twitch removed 720p30 option,"I've noticed that during the last 2 or 3 weeks twitch removed the option to watch streams (and vods) in 720p30 for a lot of partnered channels. If you don't want or can't watch in 'source' quality, you have to use the 720p60 option.

Unfortunately 720p60 looks worse than the 30FPS alternative. Most probably because the slightly higher bitrate isn't appropriate for 60FPS. Darker areas or foliage look like pixel soup. But guess what: it's a 60 Frames per Second pixel soup!

I hope twitch brings back the 720p30 option! 

It was the only reliable alternative if:

lshy6q,Twitch's Automatic Purple Mid-roll Ads,"Hey, I'm the FrankerFaceZ lead developer and I'm here to shine a bit of light onto the issue a lot of people are seeing with automatic mid-roll ads saying they should review their third-party tools.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is a long post, so TL;DR: It's probably AdBlock. It always was. If you don't believe me, please check. Seriously. Check. Scroll down to ""What's My Player Type?"" to see how to check. If `player_type` is not `site`, I want to know. Staff want to know. Let's get to the bottom of this.

&amp;#x200B;

To the best of my knowledge, which involves talks specifically with Twitch staff from the video engineering team, that specific screen is triggered when you are viewing using a player type other than site. Let me explain.

When the Twitch player loads a live stream, it sends a request to Twitch's API asking for an access token. That request includes a `player_type`, telling the API what sort of context the player is in. If you're watching on the main website, that type is `site`. If you're watching in an embed somewhere, the type if `embed`. There are several other types, but those are the two most common ones, and the relevant ones here.

Depending on what `player_type` your player has, it changes what sorts of advertisements are included in your Twitch stream.

* When you're on the main website (aka `site`) that can include pre-roll ads when first loading a stream. It also includes mid-roll ads whenever the streamer shows them.
* When you're on `embed`, that does not include pre-roll ads. That does not include normal mid-roll ads. That **does** include automatic mid-roll house ads.

The embedded player doesn't show normal advertisements because Twitch doesn't have full control of the presentation of the content. They can't ensure that an ad impression in an embed would be a satisfactory impression for the company advertising with them. So, you just don't see ads in that case.

Previously, `embed`s just didn't have any advertisements at all. However, late last year they added automatic mid-roll house ads to non-`site` player types. A house ad is content local to Twitch. It could be an advertisement for TwitchCon. Usually and in this case, though, it's just a purple screen telling you to watch on Twitch. And that you might have add-ons causing trouble.

The change to `embed` players was a reaction to a popular trend in Twitch ad-blocking techniques that would change the `player_type` to a type that did not receive any advertisements at all.

So, what does that have to do with the situation now? Some ad-blockers are still changing `player_type`, even though it does not effectively block ads and in many cases creates more annoyance because of the forced mid-roll house ads, aka the purple screen.

I've checked into a few popular ad-blockers and found:

* **AdBlock**: This is likely the primary culprit for a lot of people. AdBlock has a content script that is injected into all `twitch.tv` pages. The content script changes the `player type` to `embed`, leading to the automatic mid-roll house ads. **This behavior is not disabled by whitelisting Twitch in AdBlock**. You can allegedly disable it on specific channels by whitelisting those channels, after enabling a feature to play ads on specific channels and restarting your browser, but I was unable to make this feature work.
* **uBlock: Origin**: This by itself is not causing issues. uBlock *does* include a content script in all `twitch.tv` pages that attempts to change the `player_type`. However, the script is outdated and has no effect on the current player.
* **uBlock +** `userResourceLocation`: This is the issue for uBlock users. It is popular to add a custom script to uBlock's advanced settings to attempt to block Twitch ads, and many of them do so by changing the `player_type`. They will also continue to run even if you whitelist Twitch in uBlock's settings. Please make sure to check your `userResourceLocation` in advanced settings if you're having the issue.
* **AdBlockPlus**: ABP does not currently have any scripts for modifying the `player_type` on Twitch, and should be fine.

In summary, stop using AdBlock if you use that specific ad-blocker, and make sure you don't have a custom script installed in uBlock: Origin.

# What's My Player Type?

To the best of my knowledge, `player_type` is at the heart of all this. If you have the wrong one, you see purple. If you don't, you don't. I am very interested in any possible reports about seeing the purple screen without a modified `player_type`. The staff I know are also interested.

But how do you check? There are two ways.

First, if you have FrankerFaceZ installed, make sure Playback Statistics metadata is turned on in the FFZ Control Center (under Channel &gt; Metadata). Then, check the tool-tip [as shown here](https://i.imgur.com/9PcBnUX.png). If you see a warning about your player type, something's up.

Don't have FrankerFaceZ? You'll need to check your browser's Developer Tools, in that case. Chrome and Firefox users on Windows can use `Ctrl-Shift-I` to open them, or you can find a link in your browser's main menu.

Once you have developer tools open, you need to go to the Network tab. And once you do that, go ahead and refresh the page to be sure. The Network tab won't show everything unless you refresh with it open.

Once you've got it open, you want to filter by `player_type`. If you're on Chrome, you might have to click the [filter button](https://i.imgur.com/D4TnpLJ.png) to show the filtering settings first. You should see one item in the list, named something like `some_channel.m3u8?...` Click on that entry, and then get ready to look through a giant URL for `player_type`. This is what it looks like [on Chrome](https://i.imgur.com/Nxj3MFU.png) and [on Firefox](https://i.imgur.com/AsxcWkq.png).

I went ahead and highlighted the relevant bits in yellow. In both those examples, the `player_type` is `site`. If you see something other than `site` there and you're on Twitch's main website, something's up.

# Afterword

If you don't have a different `player_type`, and you're still seeing the purple mid-roll house ads, let me know. I'll go bug people about it. In that event, please include a full list of extensions you're using, and which browser. If you *do* have the wrong `player_type`, try disabling extensions until it goes away.

And whenever you disable extensions, make sure to refresh the page. You have to refresh to make sure that any content scripts they added are removed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/lshy6q/twitchs_automatic_purple_midroll_ads/,1614290001.0,321,0.95,180,Twitch,SirStendec

lre5tt,[Poll] What Stream Resolution Quality Do Watch Streamers On?,"Hello everyone,

I just wanted to do this poll to get some ideas on what stream resolution quality most viewers here watch on. 

Link: **[HERE](http://www.strawpoll.me/42692800)**

I, myself, stream a lot, but I watch more twitch overall. I usually am able to watch in 1080p. I am fortunate enough that I have solid internet to watch in that resolution.

On the streaming front, I am having a bit of technical issues with my setup. I was streaming at 1080p but I had to lower it to 720p because of PC performance issues.

This is how I came up with this poll. Even though none of you are my viewers, I was wondering what majority of viewers here favor more. 

Are 1080p streams the only ones you watch? Is 720p a dealbreaker for you?

Can you only watch 480p streams because of internet limitations?

I think a lot of streamers can benefit from the answers we get in the poll.

lr557k,What makes you want to stop watching a stream?,"I'm new to streaming and I've been checking out all sorts of streams I guess with a critical eye to try to figure out what sorts of things might turn a viewer off a stream entirely, so that I can avoid them.  I know one can't appeal to everybody and some things are tolerable for some people and off-limits for others, but I wonder if there are some common, avoidable turn-offs/dealbreakers?  My personal ones so far are:

* Poor sound qualityThis is worse when a streamer is collabing/playing with someone else who has even worse sound quality. This includes voices being mixed under game audio.
* Not saying anything/saying littleSelf-explanatory really.
* Only reading on-screen text and not saying anything else and/or
* Reading out comments/text too quickly for me to comprehend/reading text out in a flat voiceI saw this with a couple of people playing games with a lot of dialogue. I can read! It'd be good to hear some commentary, jokes or asides about the text on screen instead. Voicing some lines I can tolerate, hearing everything read out in a flat voice bores me. I've made presentations IRL where I've had to present a large block of text on a powerpoint slide from time to time (eg a long-ish quote), and I find that pacing myself in a way that gives people time to read the text, and then commenting on it goes over better than reading it out quickly. Alternatively, summarising text on-screen works if the specific words don't matter. I know preferences vary.
* Avoidable technical difficultiesTuned in, two streamers who were collabing had difficulties setting up multiplayer for a game - something they could have set up before streaming. Their chat gave good advice - streamer brushed it off. I came back fifteen minutes later and they were still setting it up. I admit I've had some technical issues starting out and no one is free from them, but I am less inclined to stick around if I see them or if people don't roll with the punches.

What are your turn-offs? What have you done in your stream to avoid them?

EDIT: Thank you for all of your insightful and helpful responses.  I read them all and tried to condense recurring themes into this list. I know this list doesn't capture everything people said, but for me these were the key takeaways:

* Bad audio is indeed a very common turn-off (eg bad mic quality, poorly mixed audio, background noise, streamer blowing nose air into mic).
* Toxicity from the streamer/Ill-tempered, irritable streamer
* Streamer ignoring chat/ignoring raids
* Streamer being rude to chat, giving curt responses, or not dealing politely with disagreement
* Streamer focusing on the chat so much they don't play the game anymore
* Followers only chat
* Streamer arguing with the trolls in chat
* Toxic, unruly chat/unmoderated chat
* Things on screen obscuring gameplay-significant elements, eg overlays or cam
* Insincere personality/fake over-the-top reactions
* No facecam (\**crying in vtuber\* Vtubing counts, right???*)

lcocpn,300-400 Viewer Average and Partner in 5 Months Here is my Advice,"Just yesterday I hit ~~free twitch turbo~~ partner on twitch after roughly 5 months of streaming (somewhat) consistently. Today I'm hoping to share some decent advice and give my own (learned) opinion on some of the frequent yet not always useful tips shared around here.

Before writing this I did a cursory search through the subreddit for frequently asked questions so hopefully this answers most of the ones that I myself have any experience to answer.

**My simple request:** I'm not going to be posting any links to my stream or anything but if you go out of your way to find it please don't follow/subscribe to the channel unless you are genuinely interested. Thanks big boss.

# Should you stream?

If I have to read another thread or comment of a person asking if they should stream I am going to scream. What do you people expect to hear? Yes, please stream the world needs you, you will be rich beyond your wildest dreams and have all the clout to have ever been cloutted.

I know people who usually type out questions like that probably don't read posts but here is a hack I've used to answer my own dumb questions through out the years. Say that shit out loud and respond to it like someone asked you the question. Nine times out of ten, you end up answering it yourself and on the off-chance you actually don't you should have a more actionable question.

Example: Instead of asking ""should I stream?"" you end up realizing the only thing holding you back is having no mic or something. The question then becomes ""I want to stream what's a good cheap mic?"".  Which is a lot better and doesn't make people want to pelt you with rocks.

For those of you who ask ""should I stream or is it a waste of time?"" please, I BEG YOU, stop. Most of the shit you do is a waste of time, you either want to stream or don't. Make a decision based on that.

# Webcam, do you need one?

This question is asked so often that I see it every time I come on the subreddit. Unsurprisingly, the answer is always the same as well, yes you do.

**However I disagree.**

I have never streamed with a webcam, not a single time, yet I'm still here and somehow managed to get partnered.

Now, I know why every one parrots the same advice, it is because the people making tip threads, youtube videos, etc., all say to use a webcam. Harris Heller said it once and I'm pretty sure that was enough for the people who copy and paste what he says in text threads here to become their mantra.

The truth is, all that matters is the content. Ask yourself do you do/want to do a lot of react/just chatting content? If so, you probably want a webcam since your content will focus around reacting to content. Lirik doesn't use face-cam because his content is his gameplay and commentary, not his face. Corpse literally blew up and is famous for not showing his face (even though he is still a personality).

I know the whole ""Lirik doesn't use a face cam"" argument is going to be met with people saying ""exception not the rule!!!"" but seriously, just use your head. Half the people you watch probably don't need face cams. MoonMoon probably doesn't need a face cam, Critikal didn't have a face cam until he already had over a million subs on youtube, schlatt didn't either, Dream doesn't, AdmiralBahroo doesn't, almost every DBD streamer I watch doesn't, just think for yourself.

The point I'm trying to drive home here is not just that a webcam isn't required, but also you need to look at what you want to create and decide for yourself.

Edit: I saw someone say somewhere that you need a webcam for sponsors. That's cap. I've had a sponsor and nobody has seen this ugly mug.

# Equipment in general

People like saying that they need this this and that before they start streaming. This is just stalling. Until last month I hadn't owned a desktop PC my whole life. Before that it was just laptops and using my phone to read chat or look up things. You obviously need SOME equipment to start, i.e. a computer and some form of internet connection, but that doesn't mean you need to pick up a shure, a streamdeck, 4 monitors, 6 consoles, and whatnot.

Here is my setup. Keep in mind I literally just upgraded this last month after saving up for several months:

* Blue Yeti: Hell ya baby got a free game with it too so I'm for sure pleased with this purchase. **Edit**: I recommend shopping around for mics since the yeti isn't as much of a ""get this for streaming"" mic as it once was. Plenty of good options out there for cheaper
* Two BenQ monitors: Like I said, I was using my phone for chat but that got old fast. These monitors are cheap and 144hz. There are some color issues but eff it I barely notice anymore
* Streamer PC from NZXT: My old laptop was from 2016 and made editing literal hell. Averaged 3 crashes every time I would try and render (and the renders took about an hour). Upgrading to this was the most worth purchase I've ever made. Also, the streamer PC got upgraded since I purchased, so you can grab a 2070 instead of the 2060 ti like I have :)
* Red Dragon Keyboard and Mouse: I'm a cheap ass so when I see light up peripherals for like 40 bucks total I am sold.
* Earbuds: Legit don't know the brand. I stole them from my sister like a year ago. I prefer these over a headset anyway since I don't want that gamer dent lmao

**For those of you who are probably saying ""GROSS A PRE-BUILT"" remember that part prices are actual aids right now, not to mention the availability of even finding good parts.** If you have the cash go pre-built that shit is amazing.

**My recommendation:**

Stay with your shitty set-up as long as possible but make sure to pick up a good mic first. Big streamers (looking at you Ludwig) shit on the Yeti, but straight facts all you need is to EQ that shit a lil bit and nobody will bat an eye. You don't have to pick up the Yeti (there are lots of cheaper options) but that's just the one I and many others have gotten since it is reliably a good ass mic.

Audio &lt;- chat engagement &lt;- pc upgrade

# YouTube

How many people have to tell you bums to focus on YouTube before you do it? Twitch sucks ass. I'll say it, i'm brave. No discoverability, especially to those of you at the very bottom. Make a goddamn YouTube and start pumping out videos, it is not hard.

Ludwig made a power point on how to be a streamer that talks about a few things but the most important point of all was what he said on creating content for stream/YouTube. This isn't the exact timestamp but it do be close: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/896089267?t=01h24m14s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/896089267?t=01h24m14s)

That advice is coming from a top streamer who also has over a million subs on YouTube by almost exclusively taking twitch vods and editing them for YouTube.

As for getting views on your videos here is my advice from my personal experiences:

* Thumbnail and title are important but there are outliers that can thrive without doing shit. One guy I saw has their most watched video (over 250k views) with a title like ""\[game\] \[character\] gameplay"" and the literal default thumbnail that youtube makes. AND to top that off it was just a VOD from their twitch channel.
* Audience retention matters. There is a reason massive YouTubers have these weird zoom in pans and flamboyant gestures all the time. Lots of movement and noises keep our tiny attention spans happy and frequently cutting is usually the key to success, although don't overuse it. I do very light edits and have been growing but that's more of my personal preference rather than a growth strategy.
* **Respond and engage**. If you have one comment on your video and they are complimenting you, why aren't you responding? This is by far the easiest way to get someone to continue to engage with you and trust me, that is the most important thing in the algorithms eyes.

# My understanding of YouTube

So obviously, clickthrough rate and audience retention are the things that are constantly brought up when talking about gaining more views and what not, but I am fairly comfortable in saying that there are other metrics that you should be paying attention to.

Let me hit you with a something that would make Dream shake in his boots. I don't subscribe to anyone on YouTube. \*gasp\*

The reason for that being, I almost always have the videos I want to see on my home page. I never have to go, ""wonder if x YouTuber made a video"" since YouTube knows I watch and enjoy their stuff. The question for most people being, how does YouTube know what people like and how does it suggest it to them? Basically, by seeing how often people engage with your content AND also what type of content you create. (although keep in mind, youtube tries to throw new videos at you a lot as well, these are usually in-line with content you engage with though)

For engagement, think of it as like affinity points in a video game but in reverse. Before you get to bang that smoking hot sim, you got to woo them. Every time someone likes your video they get a point, every time they comment they get two, every subscription counts as like 10, watching an entire video might be 20, etc. Obviously, these are made up values but I hope you follow what I'm putting down here. Once they get enough points you start showing up more in their home page.

I know this because I have a different account on my phone that doesn't have the same suggestions as my main account because I watch different things on my PC than my phone. However, I do like to look at the comments while I'm taking a dump or something. Problem was, my videos were rarely every recommended. I solved this easily by liking a couple videos. I didn't even watch them, just liked and read comments. **LITERALLY NOT EVEN SUBSCRIBED AND I GET NOTIFICATIONS ON MY PHONE SOMETIMES WHEN A VIDEO DOES WELL!**

**In other words, by getting people to like and comment on your videos you are almost guaranteeing they see future videos from you.**

Now, keep in mind, engagement is only a small portion of the whole pie. And even though you might engage with a content creator often, there is still a chance you miss some of their videos because of one other reason, the content's genre.

# Content Genre

You might have noticed this phenomenon on various different creators YouTubes, but sometimes they create a video that bombs. Usually, this happens when they create something outside of their niche. This could be as simple as changing games, or as radical as changing the entire direction of the channel. Even if you engage like crazy with a creator, if they change the content enough, you won't get that shit recommended to you.

This is the main reason some creators have several channels and why some even get pigeonholed to one type of content. The reality of it is, if you build your audience on one piece of content and then want to change it, you will be fighting an uphill battle. One of the best ways to fight that is to diversify early OR better yet, emphasize your personality over the content. Jschlatt shits views and he does whatever the hell he wants really. Same goes for jacksepticeye, markiplier, Ludwig, Critikal, XQC, and numerous other creators.

That being said, doing one game/genre isn't a bad strategy either. A metric fuck ton of OfflineTv's videos are the same game. DisguisedToast played Hearthstone on repeat, then switched to TFT, THEN switched to among us, and his videos absolutely kill. Valkyrae is one of the biggest streamers period and all she does is play/upload among us and rust. Then of course we have all the minecraft streamers too.

It's really up to you to decide, but I'd recommend going towards personality content since that allows the most flexibility.

# Other Social Media (Twitter, IG, etc)

Lots of people here seem to think that they don't have time to do YouTube or some other BS they think up as an excuse, so they think that twitter, instagram, tiktok, etc are all ways to grow. Trust me, they are not good ways to grow.

These are all stupid treadmills that trick you into thinking you're doing something when in reality you aren't moving the needle by much if by any at all. Posting ten dumb tweets and reposting memes on IG seem ""productive"" if you frame it in the light of ""content creation"" but the two people that see all of these things don't really give a shit. Spend that time working on a video for YouTube.

Don't give me this ""I don't have time"" bullshit. Do small videos and work yourself up, become better and faster. Perfectionism is a cute word for procrastination.

Ok, now that I took a shit on them so hopefully, you *won't* grind on them all day, these are still ways to grow and are important. Having multiple platforms for fans to communicate and engage with you is always a good idea, but don't spread yourself so thin early on when nobody knows who you are. Prioritize the thing that will get eighty percent of your results.

I personally have a discord for people to come and chat in. Thing is, I had no intention of doing so because I don't really use discord that much. The only reason it exists is that people kept asking for it in the comments on my YouTube videos so I made one.

**TL;DR: Don't put the cart before the horse :)**

Edit: Oh ya I forgot to mention. TikTok is trash for growth. I won't mention names cuz that's probably toxic(?) but there is someone signed on luminosity who has 690k TikTok followers and 95k YouTube subscribers who barely cracks 100 views on Twitch and has a hard time getting over 1k on YouTube. So don't go thinking TikTok leads to immense fame ya darn kids

# Hosting/Raiding

Getting hosted/raided means actual jack. I remember pretty clearly when I had like ten viewers, I got hosted by someone with twenty-five or something. I think only one person ended up saying anything in the chat to me about it and although some stayed for the entire stream, by the time I went live again I lost all of the people who were in the host. This seems to be something others have mentioned as well, you won't retain almost any views from hosts/raids.

Edit: Please do try raiding/hosting or otherwise networking with other streamers at least once. Your mileage may vary and it could end up blowing up your channel. Who knows?

Edit edit: Having something that you can do during the stream is huge when getting hosted/raided. Most of the time, if not all of the time, a streamer is ENDING their stream and sending viewers to you rather than timing it for your own content. So if you are doing something uninteresting or are in the middle of something you are going to get less retention than if you did something crazy to impress the newcomers. In other words, having a strategy for hosting/raiding growth is key.

# Speaking on stream

This seems to be something a lot of people struggle with on Twitch since so many people ask how to do it when nobody is watching/chatting. Coming from someone who had this problem, the answer is pretty simple, talk for the content not the chat.

What I mean by this is you should be focusing on your content more than the chat. Since I play games, what I do is just say some shit about whats happening on screen and sometimes say something that is hopefully funny. Pick up a garbage item? Say something about how garbage the item is, ez.

If you're streaming to NO VIEWERS you shouldn't be streaming to stream anyway. What you should be doing is making a YouTube video in the hopes of getting viewers to watch your stream. The only way to do that is to have good content planned out that should effectively act as your script. Again, Ludwigs stream on this is good (it'll probably be a video soon) so make sure to check it out.

A more recent problem I've had was just how much I engaged with chat (suffering from success I know). When I went to edit the videos I had to cut large swathes of the video because I was just chatting to people. Make sure to avoid this when you are actually trying to get content out for YouTube as it can mess up the flow of a video and make it harder to edit. You still can chat with people just make sure not to go overboard. Again, Ludwig is a perfect example of this, just look at his videos and streams and notice the difference between the two.

# Streaming as a job/hobby

I hate this dumb argument of streaming isn't your hobby or twitch isn't your job. You have 24 hours in the day, subtract 8 for sleeping and depending on your job, 9 for work. All that extra time can be spent doing whatever the fuck you want. Want to get big and make money streaming? Do work. Want to just stream while you're playing games anyway? Do that.

IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL AT SOMETHING YOU PUT IN THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO DO SO! So stop telling people it has to be a hobby or it has to be a job. It can be either for christ's sake.

# Partner difference

I have a checkmark which makes me a better person.

No, but seriously, partner doesn't really do much other than add more emote slots and some quality options. Also, you don't gain extra cash as a partner either. I don't have the mystical bounty board or god-tier split, just the checkmark to flex baby.

# Opinion on affiliate

Devin Nash made a video about how affiliate is a scam, which is kinda true but only for people with no viewers. Having the sub button is huge and even when I was small small, affiliate gave me a couple hundred bucks a month for no effort on my part. Patreon is probably better though, no lie.

# Twitch ""grind""

If you stream 5+ hours a day without making content that lives somewhere else please form a neat line so I can smack you all. People saying they have no time drives me nuts, but when they also ""grind"" all day AND say that, it makes me want to punch air.

1. Stream YouTube friendly content
2. Stop stream and edit content
3. Upload and plug twitch in the video
4. repeat

That is the only ""grind"" you should be on. Affiliate is stupid if the 3 viewers you have are all just you on a different ipad.

# Luck

You know what? Maybe PewDiePie got lucky and that's how he is such a big YouTuber. Maybe early twitch streamers got all their views because they were early adopters. Or maybe these people only got lucky because they showed up and actually put the effort in.

There are plenty of videos on my channel that looked like flops at first. They got like a couple of hundred views and didn't do well. However, after continuously publishing, a whole bunch of them ended up blowing up and becoming some of the most-watched. Without publishing more videos they would have ended up dead in the water. Consistency &gt; luck.

I don't believe too much in luck when it comes to doing very simple things (LIKE MAKING A YOUTUBE VIDEO) but you literally cannot win the lottery if you do not purchase a ticket, it's that simple.

# Editing Software

A couple of people asked this so I thought I should add it here. I use davinci resolve for my videos. Previously, I used hitfilm or something like that I can't quite remember the name, but I had to switch because they don't allow you to have split audio channels (i.e. one for desktop audio and one for mic audio).

I've literally never touched any paid software like premier or anything because, again, I'm a cheap ass.

# What should you upload to YouTube?

Seriously just look at Ludwig, smallant, DisguisedToast, literally every top Twitch streamer with a YouTube. All three of the people I just mentioned are over one million subs on YT and are top streamers, so they are definitely doing something right.

In terms of off-stream content, guides are king. If you're a small YT channel with ZERO subs you can still get thousands of views by hitting the search algorithm of YT. My first 3 videos were uncut gameplay, guide video, guide video, in that order. Guess which ones have tens of thousands of views and which has less than a thousand? Guide videos are insane for small channels.

Edit: Actually, let's just call it searchable content. Searchable content is king

lcdhj4,is reporting enough?,"Hello guys,  
I feel terrible right now even with a very good stream that happened. There was this incident that happened on my stream. I downed and killed someone in the game warzone and they followed me to my twitch channel where they said some horrible things and the worse part about it was the guy was streaming it as it happened. Incited to his viewers to come onto my stream to make it worse. After reviewing their vod, their one team mate who is also a streamer with a decent amount of followers said ""Im tracking his IP address""  ""his dick is small bc he is asian"" and trying to mock me with ""asian accent miyagi voice"" type of comments. I have their vods saved and messages screenshotted. They are blocked now on top of that but inciting to their viewers to come into another person's stream for anything other than being supportive is just really disappointing altogether. I do hope that reporting them to Twitch is enough but I highly doubt it.   


On the side note, if you guys ever feel like you're being discriminated against, always reach out and get help to resolve those issues.

lc9hsg,I was about to quit streaming today,"I honestly was having such a hard time streaming the past couple days. I play Call of Duty and Warzone which is so competitive and it’s hard for people to take me seriously as a streamer (as I’m female) and I was playing SO horrible that I could literally see people entering and leaving my stream. However I hit affiliate with my last stream last night and as I was going to quit today I got my first three subs from some long time viewers. It made me feel so appreciated. 

So to anyone saying they want to quit don’t give up! I know it’s a small feat but taking it day by day is key. If you’re a small streamer just keep going you’ll meet people that can literally make your day as they did mine today.

lbqeil,Not being able to squad stream as an affiliate is infuriating (rant),"I understand the reasoning behind not allowing all streamers the permission to squad stream, but why would you not allow the people who need that option the most to do so? I got so excited when I learned the option was available. I started looking for other streamers who were like me. Small. Around 10 viewers. Consistent and positive. Imagine my dismay when I realized that after finding like minded streamers, that option doesn't exist for me. The most frustrating thing? Almost none of the people who are partnered actually use this feature.  


I entered the tag on the main page and wouldn't you know it! Less then 20 streamers actually use this feature! I used to be a mixer streamer and co streaming was my saving grace! It helped me grow so much and it was available to EVERYONE.   


Does anyone know whether this feature will be available in the future to affiliates at least? Because the reasoning behind affiliates not being able to do this is that twitch can't handle it on their side. But almost none of the big streamers are using this feature! It seems like a wasted feature on twitch's part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/lbqeil/not_being_able_to_squad_stream_as_an_affiliate_is/,1612367155.0,1224,0.96,93,Twitch,NAEKEM

lba3t4,To all aspiring streamers: Don't stop talking,"I usually watch small streamers and I want to say one thing: I rarely say ""hello"" the first time I watch someone. The easiest way for me to break the ice is to comment on something you're saying or doing. Give me something to break the ice. I'm more likely to say ""that's a good song"" (if you're listening to music I like) or ""what are you ordering?"" (if you're talking about ordering food) than I am to say ""hi"" as my first message. Then you'll answer to that and we'll get shit going.

But if you're there quiet doing nothing because you think nobody's watching, all you're doing is giving me the task of initiating conversation and, like a lot of shy people, I don't like that. Make it easier on the viewer. Talk a lot. Obviously we as viewers understand that if you're in the middle of a fight you are focused on the game, but focus time shouldn't last that long. If you're moving to the next zone, you died and you're waiting to respawn next round, you're just killing mobs, you finished a boss fight.. you can start talking again. 

One more thing. I watch people for their personality, I feel like a lot of viewers are the same. I've said this before: Unless you're in the top .1% of skill level, hardly anyone will watch you for that reason. No point in watching a player in the second best rank of a game when basically the entire top rank is made up of streamers. I'm clicking on your stream either because we made friends somewhere else (discord server, another streamer's channel) or because it's a game I like and I feel that can help break the ice. I'm staying because your personality fits with mine and we get along. There will always be someone objectively better at the game than you streaming at the same time, but it's impossible to say that a personality is objectively better than another one.

We watch smaller streamers because we want people who talk and interact. We want to meet people and make friends, so let's make it easier to do so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/lba3t4/to_all_aspiring_streamers_dont_stop_talking/,1612309478.0,1760,0.97,234,Twitch,Alk_Live
lat1xv,"User is doxing me, police contacted and crime reported but Twitch is silent","Hi!

Hope you can help me

It's a long story so here is the summary:

* user is revealing my personal information during my streams on new accounts
* I know who it is
* police contacted and crime reported
* police needs a proof from Twitch
* due to international law (I am in the UK) it will take a lot of effort and time for police to get that info from Twitch
* Twitch is currently ignoring my attempts at contacting them

So basically my question is: is there some kind of direct contact to Twitch? Phone number or maybe some kind of community manager? I understand they are overwhelmed but this is pretty urgent so surely they have solutions in place for situations like these? I just want to speak to actual human.

Please - any help will be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: 

Thank you everyone for the advice and help. Your support means a lot.

Today I streamed with my follow alerts off and with follow only chat (10 minute follow). It is obviously not ideal and I wish I didn't have to do it but at least this way I can remove any attempts at revealing my personal information before it happens.

I will also contact my police again and ask them to do that subpoena thing as suggested by Twitch Program Manager in here.

l9qwdd,Someone is trying to take legal action to get my name.,"Hi I've had my name on twitch for years now, I mainly use it to watch streams or stream to my friends. Yesterday i got on my phone recently and I saw I had a whisper from someone who wants me to change name because hes a ""big shot"" and hes coming from youtube to twitch. He Sent me a twitter handle that belongs  to a new org and youtube page to verify hes ""big"". I really like my name and I do not want to switch it. I decided not to reply because on mobile I cant even tell when he actually sent the message. Today he sent a message saying he will take legal action if I do not change my name and let him have it. 
This in turn has given me anxiety since my friends says if hes big twitch can give him my name. My thought process is now I got to stream so I can show I'm active and maybe just get a little following so he cannot get my name but at the same time I'm so awkward and not very entertaining. 
So what I'm trying to say can he really take legal action against me to have my name?

l9ako5,Adding Live Subtitles (with translation) to your stream FOR FREE!,"Hello, everyone! I had a couple of viewers join my stream the other night and they had some trouble understanding me because I'm an onion and onionglish wasn't their native language. They seemed to enjoy the stream and tried their best to communicate with me, so I promised them I would add subtitles to my next stream. 

One of the streamers I frequently watch has live translated subtitles, so I knew it was possible. There was a description in one of her panels with information on the subtitles and a link to the creator, so I followed it. In retrospect, the instructions were actually pretty simple and clear, but I'm an onion and understanding things don't come easy for me. I haven't found an English tutorial on this, so here it is:



Step 1: Visit http://www.sayonari.com/trans_asr/​

Step 2: Create a new script at https://script.google.com/​
-Delete the default code

Step 3: Copy and paste the code from https://github.com/tanabee/google-tra...​ to your Google Apps script.

Step 4: Name the script and save it.

Step 5: Set the script to be accessible by everyone and deploy script.
-You will receive a deployment ID when the script is successfully deployed.

Step 6: Copy the following URL: https://sayonari.coresv.com/ninshikiC...​ &amp;gas_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-replace the Xs with the deployment id you received in step 5

Step 7: Modify the url according to the settings presented at http://www.sayonari.com/trans_asr/​

Step 8: Add a new window source in OBS targeting the browser tab (NOTE: this only works with Chrome) that has the subtitle page open.

Step 9: Crop the source via transform

Step 10: Add chroma key to make the background transparent.

Step 11: ??

Step 12: Profit!

I'd write down the dates I streamed and the games I played ahead of time (helping me keep to a schedule and think forward about my channel), then make notes about my viewer turnout and general feel of the broadcast once it was over. Not only is it satisfying to look back and see what I've accomplished over the past few months, but the notes I've gathered have helped me understand how to grow my channel more.

My channel's focus is on indie games, which covers a wide range of genres and aesthetics. However, I can look at my log and see what kinds of games drove in viewers, which ones appealed to my niche audience, and what sorts of games either don't work well for me or don't land well with the audience. For instance, certain popular games like VVVVVV and Costume Quest worked well because of their good word of mouth and a bit of a nostalgia factor for other indie fans. On the other hand, I've noticed I don't get that many takers for my Wednesday streams, so I'm looking to tweak my schedule to be more accommodating for my Monday regulars.

hvnf42,"A vent on my ""first"" stream","These are just some feelings I am experiencing and I wanted to put this out there.

I am new to twitch and Ive been working really hard to learn the ins and outs. I have watched countless how to videos, watched other streamers, spent time fixing my channel and learning about panels and alerts etc. 

Anyway, today I logged on and I was trying to do a test stream to check audio and alerts. It wasnt labeled and it was only up for a moment. Someone popped on which is fine, its totally public so even though its a test I know it doesnt keep it from being seen.

Anyway, they came on chat and said hello. It was my first interaction. I just explained that I was testing notifications. Then my notification popped up that they followed me. It was super sweet and showed my notifications worked so I was just beaming.

A second later they send a bunch of sexual stuff. Talking about my appearance, offering money for me to do things on video. 

It was so sad for me. It wasnt even my first real stream and this already happened. I know everyone on twitch deals with this. Regardless of gender or what you look like. I just didnt think it would be before I even streamed, and with the first person to talk to me. It was really discouraging.

Keep in mind, im just a wife and a mom. I made sure to wear a boxy tshirt. No skin. And I also didnt expect anyone to see me anyway.

After that happened, I quick googled how to deactivate twitch. I know I need to grow a tougher skin. (Though I shouldnt have to) But I just wanted to put out there how much it hurts to want to be a part of a community only to have it treat you that way before you even walk through the door.

Of course I am not saying everyone is like that. Its like walking in to the first day of school and someone pushes you down the steps. Sure, most of the people inside will be nice. But getting through the bullies can be painful.

Aside from all of that, these twitch posts on reddit have been so heartwarming to read. I love seeing all of the encouragement to small streamers. Best wishes to everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/hvnf42/a_vent_on_my_first_stream/,1595393316.0,130,0.88,141,Twitch,[deleted]

Don't let someone else tell you that you can't do something. You will have friends question why you're doing this ""streaming thing"". If they aren't showing unconditional support, they really aren't your friends. I really hope this motivates at least one person today. KEEP GRINDING!

Edit: Getting a lot of comments claiming I’m motivating people to do this full-time while going broke and/or quitting their daytime job. No, I’m not.

hr67ur,I was charged an extra $10 for each of my $1 donations to a Twitch streamer. How do I get my money back?,"So, last night, I was watching someone stream and decided to donate occasionally in order to ask them stuff. I donated 5 times, each of the donations being $1. I tried to donate a 6th time, but wasn’t able to. I tried to figure out why, and, apparently, every time I donated I was charged an extra $10. I was donating through PayPal, but the 5 extra $10 charges aren’t in my PayPal transaction history. So, I decided to try to donate to the streamer again and let them know what’s going on, but without using PayPal. It worked and I was only charged $1. So, my question is, as it says in the title, how do I get my $50 back?

Update: I finally got my money back after 6 business days. The reason it took so long was because I had to wait for the transactions to fall off, since nobody was able to help me out.

Update 2: I finally figured out why I was charged an extra $10 for each of my donations. Below the pay now button, it says that they'll charge $10 to see if the card is working.

gzaurj,One of the reasons for the sudden DCMA takedowns,"This is a result of all the DJs that jumped on Twitch during the Covid stay at home order, I myself was a DJ that was streaming on FB and IG and almost every live stream there was taken down and many DJs went to Twitch as a ways to generate income due to nightclubs being closed...the company they speak of is called Gracenote it detects music in streams by matching the music to its waveform signature to determine which label owns the music being played. I knew this was going to be happening and didnt even bother streaming on Twitch...last month it appears they began shadowbanning channels that played live music as some top DJs were getting 30,000 live streams to under 500 in a matter of days. How these DCMAs havent started years ago is beyond me. So that is why the sudden takedowns are happening...the DJs found the loophole to live stream mixes and now Twitch has closed it  


Gracenote was implemented a year ago on Instagram I had 100's of music clips removed from IG over a 2 day period then it was used on Facebook and Youtube and its all what we call in the music industry ""The Big 3"" record label companies that are behind it ( Warner Brothers, Universal and Sony ) they have thousands of labels and millions of songs under their umbrella that they own the rights to so unless you have permission to use the music you will get a copyright violation",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/gzaurj/one_of_the_reasons_for_the_sudden_dcma_takedowns/,1591658545.0,79,0.92,90,Twitch,djbryanc

g2kyi4,Youtube/Google are your friend New Streamers,"I have noticed alot of ""i want to stream but not a clue"" Posts recently.  


When I first started I did went on google and used that a youtube to find out how to stream and learn how to set everything up. 

It was so simple and easy to do.

Before making a post here - Do that, its much more effective than asking reddit and much easier to understand. Visual aids on how to set up OBS/ SE/ SL will help you get set up quicker.   


I have found it confusing why people do not do this as it seems to me the most logical step.   


But the people in this reddit are so nice and helpful if you get stuck but do some research first it will get you started quicker and then we can help you with any issues.

g1qa3f,View count my story,"So, I've been told over and over not to pay attention to views and turn them off because it can start getting you down.

Anyway, yesterday I had my greatest stream ever, I turned view count off!

It was my birthday and we (me and my girlfriend) thought we'd would try and get as many friends and followers to come play marbles with us. I average around 7-10 viewers per stream so as long as we had a couple people to play we were happy.

The stream blew up after around 30 minutes, over 20 people playing marbles with us and it was awesome, I've hit 20 views a couple time, then a guy dropped 10 subs, wished me happy birthday, then loads of bits dropped I was absolutely speachless, nether the less we streamed around 4 hours having a great time then raided a friend of ours.

Later I recieve my stats. 51 max viewers! And $97 in bits and subs! For a small streamer. Man. Gob smacked!  If I had got my view count on, gaurentee I would of panicked and drove people away. And I felt relieved that I didn't know about the 51 viewers.

Turn the count off guys and just enjoy yourself, I think it makes your streams look less needy and more natural.

In all honesty I don't care, I merely stream because I think it's fun to interact with folks and make jokes as I play, alongside a bunch in my discord channel. But IT WAS really neat to have multiple convos with some lovely folks. How do they decide who gets recommended and who doesn't? I have no real idea why I'd have been on a recommended list...

ej7go7,It’s ok to Clip your own channel! Do it!,"I know a lot of people can feel like it’s a bit - let’s be honest, sad and lame to clip their own stuff. It can feel like “if it was really so funny/exciting someone else would have clipped it”. And I get that, I do. But seriously do it anyways! People might have you on another screen, not know how to clip, be lurking.. maybe it’s a slow stream. No reason to not clip something that could be useful down the line. Yes, you can highlight the whole video as well, but most people are going to be more inclined to click a &lt;1 minute video then they will a 2-4 hour video. It also makes pin-pointing funny moments that much easier. 


For example - I had a super fun celebration stream the other day (Cosplay/drank/jump king - fuck jump king) and people were laughing but not too many clips were taken. I clipped the shit out of it later and made a YT video - and people are loving it!  


Don’t feel like you’re a loser for clipping your own stuff. It’s a great way to chronicle your stream without having to wade through hours of footage at another time. 


Best of luck with your guys’ growth :3


Edit: wanted to add this because the most common comment here is “what?! Who feels that way?!” The answer is - this sub. I’ve been here long enough to see this question of “can I clip my own stream” “is it weird to clip my own stream?” Multiple times.

dsnu5g,Streaming helped with my depression and got me a job,"As a kid I have always felt insecure about my body because I was overweight. I was overweight primarily for two reasons: one, I had an extremely unhealthy diet and two I never did any athletic activities. In regards to my diet, my favorite foods as a kid was a large cheese pizza from my local Pizza Hut and Oreo Cookies in any shape or form. On top of my super unhealthy diet as a kid, I also never did any athletic sports. Before I was 20, I had only been to the gym twice in my life and one of the times was just to find out how the sauna felt like. My family also never had enough money to enroll me in athletics in my school as the fees were way too high for us to afford. Because of this, video games were my life.

I started playing games when I was like 5 years old (23 years old now) and loved making Youtube videos. When I wasn’t playing videogames, I was watching people play them on YouTube such as PewDiePie, RoosterTeeth, UberHaxorNova, Teo, and so on. These creators inspired me to make my own Youtube videos which I started doing in 2011 when I was 15 that took a long time to edit. During High school, however, I developed depression and an eating disorder which led all the way till the end of my senior year. This made me stop gaming and video making entirely. I honestly wanted to end my life after high school but I kept strong and moved onto university.

In university I started to stream on twitch (and distract myself from studying) and it has been a really great benefit for my mental health. Although I had a really inconsistent schedule, it was amazing to be able to interact with people live and see a more immediate affect of my content on viewers. It also strengthened my self-confidence as I could speak so much more to fellow peers IRL. Because of this sort of boost in my public speaking skills, I got a job as a New Student Advisor for my uni and greeted the incoming class of students and had personal orientation groups. I got to meet over 300 students and personally helped them out in any way that I could. Because of streaming and practicing talking, I was able to communicate with them so much more than I would have ever thought I could, being an introvert for all of my life. Streaming also got me to become more passionate about gaming as I do way more content than I ever did, especially since I graduated.

For those of you hesitant to start streaming, I just wanted to let you know that there are so many benefits to just start, other than just playing games! Talk and enjoy your time, even if no one is watching! This is your time and you should spend your time enjoying it! Also know that streaming will have hidden benefits as well. Streaming is like those scenes in movies or even in the Sims where a character talks to themselves in the mirror to build their charisma. Practicing talking will help out so much. Just want to let you know that you can do it and I am proud of this community! Thanks for reading my TED talk.

drk9hs,"5 years on, Twitch has no guidelines to combat charity fraud.","# TL;DR

I believe in the selfless dedication of gamers to do good, but have less faith in the dedication of corporations to do good by them. Twitch tolerates poor fundraising practices that undermine the good faith on which millions of dollars in annual charitable giving are based. I have no confidence this situation will change without a vocal outcry from the community.

&amp;nbsp;

# Summary

Twitch is the largest video platform dedicated to live streaming. Twitch Broadcasters and Viewers legitimately raise millions of dollars towards charitable causes annually, drawing [international attention](http://en.rfi.fr/france/20190923-french-gamers-raise-over-3-5-million-euros-science-pasteur-charity-fundraiser). After 5 years of [promoting itself](http://twitter.com/twitchcharity) as a platform for charitable giving, Twitch has [no fundraising or charity guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/) for Broadcasters, and the misleading ""[charity](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/bb5e7234-380e-48ad-a59c-03e51274e478)"" tag can be applied to any channel without any stated restrictions from Twitch or disclosures to donors, regardless of where charitable funds are going. Twitch has, [in at least one instance](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/charity-mail.png), refused to provide donors with necessary information to confirm the charitable solicitations published on a Partnered channel, even when a direct collaboration was alleged between Twitch and a registered charity regarding the channel's revenues. Twitch has failed to address foreseeable and preventable avenues of fraud that expose millions of donors to negligent, deceptive, unethical, predatory, and fraudulent fundraising practices by Broadcasters and contracted Twitch Partners. Twitch profits from Broadcaster revenues passing through its platform and some of these revenues could have undocumented and unreported charitable origins.

&amp;nbsp;

Donors have a right to know their gifts are going directly to a charity and **not** the direct deposit of a ""somebody"", courtesy of Twitch. Donors have a right to know what portion, if any, of their gifts will be going to third parties, including Twitch. Donors should be adequately informed and protected from inducements to Subscribe/Cheer/Tip or otherwise gift in a manner where their gifts will **not** be handled in ways that are consistent with common laws governing the control of funds solicited for charitable purposes.

&amp;nbsp;

# Charity Needs To Be Completely Transparent

TwitchCon's closing ceremony declared 2019 the year of ""pro support"" for charity on Twitch:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*""In the past, you were playing support. [...] This record-breaking year, you have leveled up. This year, you went pro. And that's why we are dubbing this year the year of pro support."" -- [Anna Prosser and DJ Wheat](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/488017911?t=08h10m44s)*

&amp;nbsp;

DJ Wheat ended this declaration with a Clip montage of Broadcasters reacting to charitable donations. The channel of one such Broadcaster is presently barren. The profile displays an ""it's empty in here"" placeholder message, there is no VOD history, and all related social media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.) has been set to private. Nothing in the TwitchCon Clip or on the Twitch channel gives any indication as to how charitable funds were collected.

&amp;nbsp;

There is an old Tiltify profile in the channel's name, so it's likely the Broadcaster raised funds through a legitimate charity fundraiser. The problem is that many Broadcasters do not, because **Twitch has no charity or fundraising guidelines requiring that they do**. There's also no way for the public to readily verify the legitimacy of most fundraising efforts they are seeing on the platform.

&amp;nbsp;

If you search for ""charity"" on /r/twitch, you'll find more threads of a confused and concerned nature than celebratory. Broadcasters [routinely ask for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/search/?q=charity%2C%20help&amp;restrict_sr=1) running charity streams because Twitch provides no guidelines or [guidance](https://help.twitch.tv/s/global-search/charity). [One thread](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/charity-03.png) was downvoted for simply asking how to raise money for charity without touching the funds. A thread below it, posted by the representative of a non-profit, [asks how charities are supposed to connect with streamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/csswvw/how_can_nonprofits_best_connect_with_streamers_to/). [Charity fraud](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3d1wsd/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_charity_streams_with/) [has been a](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4e12i4/suggestion_add_a_charity_button_to_twitch_put_an/) [cyclical concern](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/1xedaq/streamer_pocketing_charity_money/) [for over 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3zc7b7/twitchtv_should_make_charity_streams_illegal/).

&amp;nbsp;

One thread posted on /r/twitch asks, *""how do you guys feel about charity streams with donations made directly to the streamer?""*

&amp;nbsp;

A major Twitch Partner (over 300 million channel views) responded:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Partner:** *""I agree, it is shady, but it was the best way to do it. Almost all charities I have done have gone through my PayPal account. [...]""*

&amp;nbsp;

This comment was made **four years ago.** Charity on Twitch has grown considerably since then, but Twitch has not provided the community with rules to mitigate against fraud and liability (and not for a [lack](https://twitch.uservoice.com/search?filter=ideas&amp;query=charity) of [suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4wm0q3/cheering_for_charity/)). Although there are [legitimate third-party fundraisers](https://twitter.com/TwitchCon/status/1151921339424542725) and charities with their own [official extensions](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/05/13/charity-extensions-making-the-world-a-better-place-one-stream-at-a-time-6a594e90f8c3/), Twitch Community Guidelines do not require their use, and **Broadcasters are not explicitly prohibited from soliciting for charitable donations using personal, for-profit PayPal accounts**.

&amp;nbsp;

Un-sponsored Partners and Affiliates who encourage Subscriptions, ""Sub Trains"", and Cheering with the promise that all revenues will go to charity are not operating on a more legitimate level. Outside of [officially recognized charity events](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2017/12/18/cheer-with-charity-to-support-a-good-cause-76f3e467048a/) and [Extensions](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/05/13/charity-extensions-making-the-world-a-better-place-one-stream-at-a-time-6a594e90f8c3/), these revenues are fungible and paid out via **direct deposit into the Broadcaster's personal bank account**. Some jurisdictions deem it unlawful to represent or imply that a charity will receive an amount greater than the actual net proceeds reasonably estimated to be retained for its use ([Gov. Code, § 12599.6, subd. (f)(8)](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-12599-6.html)), but **Twitch takes a portion of Broadcaster revenues for itself, and most contracts forbid the disclosure of this ratio to the public**. Furthermore, as Twitch does not appear to track the un-sponsored charitable fundraising activities of its Partners or Affiliates, **the giving public can only wonder if their charitable gifts are being documented and reported as such,** or simply treated as 1099-MISC revenues and income for Broadcasters. This not only obfuscates a charitable money trail that should always be completely transparent, but also shields Broadcasters from financial scrutiny by authoritative agencies and regulators tasked with holding them accountable to the public.

&amp;nbsp;

How much does a Partner/Affiliate raise, how much do they receive, and how much do they disclose at their personal discretion to the giving public? How much does Twitch take for itself? How much gets donated to charity? How much gets reported as individual income? How much do Broadcasters write off each year with a substantial charitable tax deduction using funds with charitable origins?

&amp;nbsp;

Nobody has any way of knowing.

&amp;nbsp;

# ""Donation"" is Misused and Misunderstood

Twitch [defines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-sale/) Bits as *""digital content (i.e., animated emoticons) that can only be purchased from Twitch.""* Under the [Bits Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/bits-acceptable-use/), Twitch states:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*Don’t solicit Bits in exchange for money or donations, and don’t request money or donations for Bits.*

&amp;nbsp;

A donation is given freely without return consideration. It's a gift. Within common usage, ""donation"" is a specialized term used in connection with charitable gifts to non-profits; which, in many jurisdictions, implies the funds are tax deductible.

&amp;nbsp;

However, many Broadcasters erroneously use the word ""donation"" interchangeably with the word ""tip"" when soliciting for personal profit. If Twitch clearly and unambiguously forbids this practice anywhere in writing, it does not appear to be enforced on the platform in any meaningful way. One major Twitch Partner (nearly 300 million channel views) has a giant ""DONATE"" button on their channel connected to their PayPal account. The panel describes the terms for on-screen notifications to appear, along with the following warning to donors: *""No chargebacks.""* The Partner has used this otherwise for-profit ""DONATE"" button to collect charitable donations during all of their ""charity streams"", and they are not alone. Twitch's Laissez-faire attitude towards for-profit and non-profit fundraising has enabled a gross lack of distinction between the two on major Partner channels connected to charity.

&amp;nbsp;

Using only the Twitch Bits policy for context, I posted a poll asking [how people interpreted the word ""donation""](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/charity-poll.png) in Twitch's Bits statement. All votes favored the interpretation that it is, *""money sent to an individual through PayPal or StreamLabs.""*

&amp;nbsp;

Within what capacity is Twitch using the word ""donation"" in their Bits statement? Are they acknowledging that a clear misunderstanding for the word exists on their platform by using it in a capacity they expect users to understand as ""tips""? Are they forbidding the solicitation of Bits for charitable purposes? Are they referring to a gift that is not monetary in nature?

&amp;nbsp;

Twitch provides no definition for the word ""donation"" anywhere on the page. I could find no other mention of the word within Twitch's legal guidelines (10/12/19).

&amp;nbsp;

# Partners are Protected at the Expense of the Public

It's difficult to ascertain how charitable funds are being handled even on Partnered channels lauded for their work with registered charities. One major Twitch Partner (over 35 million channel views) made the following claims about revenues on their channel (emphasis added):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch donates** *[channel] subscription revenue to [charity]'s Newborn and Child Survival programs all around the world.* [...]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[...] *Except for minimal Twitch costs (bandwidth, support etc) all [channel] subscription revenue is* **donated by Twitch to [charity].**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**In collaboration with Twitch and [charity]**, *the stream is set up so that $4.25 of every $5 subscription fee is donated to [charity]. While on normal Twitch streams revenue is divided between Twitch and the streamer, [channel] is set up to have everything aside from Twitch's costs (such as paypal feels, bandwidth and support) donated to [charity].*

&amp;nbsp;

The charity also has its own page dedicated to the Broadcaster which states, between 2016-2019, *""[...] funds were raised from [platform], as well as* **all income (subscriptions, bits, cheers)** *generated from [channel].""*

&amp;nbsp;

On 10/9/19, I contacted Twitch Charity and Twitch Legal to [confirm these statements were accurate](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/charity-mail.png). Citing the claims on the channel and charity page, I asked (as a prospective donor) if Twitch directly sends all income from the Partnered channel to the charity. I also asked (as a Twitch Partner) if it was possible for any Partner to make the same arrangement regarding revenues on their own channel. On 10/21/19, I received the following response from the Twitch Charity Team:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*We are unable to comment on another user’s account details for privacy reasons. If you have questions concerning how your potential donation would be handled by the creator seeking donations, then please ask those questions directly of the creator.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*As an Affiliate or Partner, you may choose to donate the revenue you have earned on Twitch to a charity of your choosing. Twitch does not process this donation for you, and you are responsible for ensuring your fundraising activities comply with all applicable laws.* **-- Twitch Charity Team**

&amp;nbsp;

Whether it's unable or unwilling, Twitch refused to provide a prospective donor with the necessary information to confirm the authenticity of charitable solicitations published on a Partnered channel, even when those statements alleged a collaboration between Twitch and a registered charity. Twitch, upon being notified of the published statements, did not denounce them in its official response, nor clearly disassociate itself from the full body of duties and obligations being alleged and implied, or owed to donors under applicable laws.

&amp;nbsp;

No response was ever received from Twitch Legal -- not even an automated one.

&amp;nbsp;

# Platform for Convoluted Charity Schemes

On 10/24/19, a visit to the aforementioned Partner's channel revealed that all text panels, including those about charity, had been removed. The only plain text remaining was an e-mail address ""for business &amp; press inquiries only."" Beside it was an image panel labeled ""DONATE"".

&amp;nbsp;

During this visit to the Partner's channel, the following exchange occurred during a live broadcast:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Partner:** *What matters at the end of the day is what you can do for the world and how you can contribute. [...] That's why I started this place where people can change the world. Here's the link -- you can change the world.*

&amp;nbsp;

The link was for an application to work with the Partner's organization at their compound. Describing itself as a *""group of activists working [...] to make a positive impact in the world,""* their *""main focus is to inspire people through action and raise awareness around important issues.""* When a Twitch viewer asked for more details about what it is they do, the Partner described extensive charity efforts benefiting children.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Viewer:** *Can you exactly say what you do to change the world in your compound? ""We change the world here"" is very vague at best, it gives 0 information [...].*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Partner:** *Maybe just do a quick Google search. I'm one of the biggest philanthropists on the Internet. I raise more than 25 million dollars for children in need, reaching more than 2.5 million children in very effective ways. You're not just talking to a random streamer, bro. I have a very big history. I've been on CNN. I've been invited to the United Nations, even the European Union. I've spoken for [stations] all over the world.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Viewer:** *How are the children supported?*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Viewer:** *Watch your ego, bro.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Twitch Partner:** *""How are the children supported?"" ""Check your ego, bro?"" Well, the guy's just talking to me, like, ""hey, what do you do?"" I'm just giving you a little rundown, bro, and then you call it ego? These are just facts. There's nothing ego about it. It's okay to have an ego, but I don't have an ego.*

&amp;nbsp;

I searched for more facts about charity work on the website linked by the Partner. A section titled ""Our Vision"" describes two ""crypto utility tokens"" conceived by the organization and used in alleged collaboration with a registered charity to benefit its cause.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*Pilot projects in developing regions are expected to launch in 2019 in collaboration with [charity]. These experiments will examine the intricacies and viability of implementing universal basic income on wider scales and, perhaps one day, in the whole world.*

&amp;nbsp;

The application posted by the Partner in chat asks how many tokens applicants own. The Partner has used their Twitch channel to heavily promote the tokens while boasting of their charitable applications. According to the ""White Paper"" published on the group's website, initial fundraising for the tokens took place on the Partner's Twitch channel, with tokens being ""reserved for donors"" (emphasis added):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*""[Token] was initially only distributed for donations not towards its creator but* **towards charity and/or the above-mentioned volunteers** *who are collaborating on initiatives that support [Token]. The initial limited* **fundraising was conducted through our Twitch.tv livestream** *where, at [Broadcaster]’s discretion,* **tokens were reserved for donors who support the project.** *[...]""*

&amp;nbsp;

However, one section of the White Paper confusingly goes on to state that, *""of course, none of this is legally binding, as seen in the mini-documentary""* (emphasis added):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*[...] Of course,* **none of this is legally binding,** *as seen in the mini-documentary. In the end, the entire idea of [token] is built on the psychology of supply and demand and how, when channeled through the right incentives,* **even a very simple token can grow into one of the most valuable and world-changing forces for good** *within the crypto-sphere.*

&amp;nbsp;

The ""mini-documentary"" -- once shown on the Twitch Partner's channel and now embedded on the crypto's website -- goes on to state that this ""not-for-profit"" token can be reserved by ""donating directly to [charity]"" on the Partner's crypto website. When reviewing the purchase process on the site, no means of donating directly to the charity was readily apparent, nor any guarantee that proceeds from the sale would go directly to the charity.

&amp;nbsp;

Amidst these confusing statements about a not-for-profit token benefiting charity, the Twitch Partner goes on to claim that because they humorously admit to ""running a scam,"" they are not legally bound by any of the statements, express or implied, being made to donors on their Partnered Twitch channel (emphasis added):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Co-Streamer:** *[...] I am on top and I am the money man because* **I get all the money.** *[...] Over the past few weeks,* **people have donated around one million dollars to me** *as a result of the two of us livestreaming for around a few hours each day, informing people that we are running a cryptocurrency scam.*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Twitch Partner:** *We're just running a fucking crypto scam. [...]*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Co-Streamer:** *[...] We created what is now one of the most popular Twitch donation platforms both for personal as well as charity donations. [...] Now, for our latest endeavor, we've invented our own cryptocurrency [...] and for that, we've launched an ICO. Only, it's not really an ICO.* **We like to present it as a scam.** *[...] Rather than hiding the loopholes in fine print using incomprehensible legal language,* **we are openly and clearly stating that we are strangers on the Internet who cannot be sued for fraud if we steal your money or use it for a Lambo instead.** *We do not hide our disclaimer that says* **we are not promising let alone making any legally binding statements that guarantee that you'll get any [token] in exchange for your contributions.** *So, what exactly is [token]? It is a simple token or coin that gives people the ability to contribute to its* **altruistic objectives** *by holding it.* **[Token] can be reserved by donating directly to [charity] on [token site],** *or by donating to my development team that is currently building software that accepts [token]. In neither scenario does [Twitch Partner], the creator and distributor of the token, receive nor have any right to any of the funds that are donated,* **making [token] a not-for-profit token.** *As outlined in our White Paper, we also have several unusual mechanisms and strategies in place that* **highly increase the chances of [token] becoming very valuable on exchanges.**

&amp;nbsp;

On January 25, 2018, both tokens were [de-listed from IDEX](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/idex-01.png), spawning a Twitter thread. One Twitter user [writes](http://nerdorable.net/misc/reddit/idex-01.png), *""[Partner] admitted is was a scam today, as [they have] multiple times. They're using cryptocurrency for 'satire comedy' but actually taking people's money. [Clip]""*

&amp;nbsp;

The Clip linked in the Tweet has been deleted, along with all other Clips and VODs from the ""not-for-profit"" token's initial fundraising period on the Partnered channel. If it was ""satire comedy"", it should never have come at the expense of charity on the Twitch platform.

&amp;nbsp;

# The Shameful State of the Charity Tag

If the public is looking for streams giving to charitable causes, they will not find a category for them on Twitch -- only a ""[charity](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/bb5e7234-380e-48ad-a59c-03e51274e478)"" tag. This tag should probably be renamed to ""giving"", as the word ""charity"" can create a likelihood of confusion and misunderstanding for the public about the non-profit status of a channel, conveying a false sense of legitimacy ([Gov. Code, § 12599.6, subd. (f)(2)](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-12599-6.html)). Any Broadcaster can apply the ""charity"" tag to their channel, regardless of what they are doing or where raised funds are going, with no stated restrictions or disclosures from Twitch.

&amp;nbsp;

On 9/29/19, the most popular stream I found under the ""charity"" tag was a static overlay with the title ""Animal Charity Stream - Bit Goal 2019 Appeal"" with 120 Viewers. The words ""Animal Charity Stream"" were centered on screen with a static image of a cat and Subs/Bits/Tips goals. VOD history showed the Broadcaster playing videogames while the same pet cat slept in the background. This was the only cat seen in VODs.

&amp;nbsp;

One profile panel was a collage of random cats with a plea to ""support a local cats' shelter through Streamlabs."" Another was a ""Success Story"" with a picture of two kittens that stated, *""without the generous support of people like you, Polly and Lilly wouldn't have been able to find homes [...].""* All of these panels appealed to public empathy and linked to a tip page connected to the Broadcaster's personal PayPal account.

&amp;nbsp;

Under ""Why Donate"", the Broadcaster wrote the following:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*""The donations help me and the refuge continue our work. While the love and attention our cats receive comes for free, veterinary treatment, neutering and microchipping all has to be paid for. Also, you'll be helping home a rescued cat or kitten. [...] You will receive an e-mail of a random rescue cat, and their story. [...]""*

&amp;nbsp;

Although ""Animal Charity"", ""Cat Charity"", ""Cats' Shelter"", and ""Refuge"" are mentioned frequently, no official names are provided for these supposed organizations, nor is any distinction made between them as perceived entities and the Broadcaster as an individual. Nowhere on this channel are donors provided with the most basic material information necessary to make an informed decision: where their gifts are going.

&amp;nbsp;

This is the morally and legally dubious state of the ""charity"" tag on Twitch; where donors have no idea if channels are charities themselves, or giving to charity at all. At the time of this writing, the most popular stream with the ""charity"" tag was a Twitch Partner with 117 Viewers, and all of their solicitations were for personal profit. I have seen this channel using the ""charity"" tag for over a week without engaging in any charitable activities.

&amp;nbsp;

Both channels remain online using the ""charity"" tag, despite being reported to Twitch for deceptive use of the tag while not engaged in fundraising for a specified charity.

&amp;nbsp;

# Twitch Should Act Like It Has A Fiduciary Duty

Twitch is a company headquartered and doing business in California, which is a state with strict charitable solicitation laws protecting the public from fraud, deceit and imposition. Poor fundraising practices are an area of historical abuse for charity, and these laws serve a dual purpose of preserving public trust in the integrity of charitable causes. Erosion of that trust -- our good faith belief that our gifts will be going towards a good cause -- undermines the foundation on which charitable giving is based, and on which so many good causes depend.

&amp;nbsp;

Twitch could assert that it has no fiduciary duty towards the community, or that it cannot guarantee the authenticity of claims made by its Partners/Affiliates/Broadcasters about where charitable funds raised on their channels will be going. However, Twitch does have a duty not to mislead the public or contribute to fraudulent and deceptive practices on its platform. **It is fully within Twitch's power to dictate what form charitable fundraising takes** through the creation of proper fundraising tools, integrations, and guidelines. It is fully within Twitch's power to insulate the most charitable and vulnerable members of its community from negligent, deceptive, unethical, predatory, and fraudulent practices. It is fully within Twitch's power to impose and enforce restrictions on the solicitations, promises, and claims its contracted Partners are broadcasting and publishing on Partnered Twitch channels.

&amp;nbsp;

After five years and millions of dollars in charitable fundraising, it's difficult to defend Twitch for failing to introduce so much as basic guidelines for charitable fundraising. How much longer must the community wait before it says enough is enough? What foreseeable and preventable abuses must occur before we do?

dqflse,I just hit 100 subs.,"It feels really weird to write this. I don't mean to post it as a brag, more of a confirmation for myself that it's real and to provide some information to help others achieve this. 

I originally tried streaming in 2012 but due to internet and hardware issues I had to wait until this year to start streaming after moving out of home. Since may I've been streaming 4 times a week and recently started uploading youtube vids once a week.

I put 30-50 hours a week intro streaming and I love it. I believe the following things are what have lent to my small success:

- Consistency: by being consistent people know that 7pm on a Monday is zed time. They block this time out to watch me.
- ongoing improvement: I'm always looking out for hardware to upgrade, software to incorporate and increasing the quality of my graphics (overlays/alerts). Never get complacent, you will stall your progress
- interaction: this is the biggest thing I get complimented on. I do my utmost best to reply to all that's (currently I average 30-50 viewers) and my audience can see that and understand if I miss one.

We wrote a chatbot in Javascript, using the [APIs made available by Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/). This enabled our bot to read Chat Messages, and for us to create custom commands that the bot would respond to. We're able to create fun games that the normal ChatBot couldn't do by default.  


But the magic is when we learned that the Philips Smart LED lightbulbs could be controlled using javascript as well! Which means when users write commands to the chat, they can directly control the light level in my stream room - even turning the room pitch black! I'm going live in 10 minutes with our final October stream, where you can see the bot in action.

I'd have to say that I'm quite happy with how they're now doing things, I usually run ads between every 5 games so it doesn't ruin people's experience while I'm in a middle of a game. Even now, if there are ads, it's not as bad that it takes over the screen with ads and instead it now you can see the game while the ad is playing. However, since the max time is 20m per 1m ad break.

do7hku,This is why Twitch is digging their own grave with all those ad's,"Twitch is missing something with their users experience lately and it seems to be getting to the point that people will come less on Twitch for this very reason : the omnipresence of ad's, especially, right at the beginning of the stream.

Something you have to understand when you are a usual entertainment consumer, is that you always have the choice about what you are willing to watch or not. For example, if I come home from work and want to watch some television, i'll just turn it on and pick a channel. If there's ad's playing, and **i didn't have any particular interest for this specific channel at the moment**, i will instantly switch channel. Pretty common pattern here right ? I'm willing to catch a show, or maybe a glimpse of a show, that might catch my interest or not, this is just how TV experience works in general.

The problem here is that Twitch is/was my regular television for the past few years but i just don't want to be **forced** to watch any advertisement **if i'm not even committed yet to the ongoing channel i'm connecting**. What's the point to be called [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) then ? **If it's to not behave as a plain and simple tv experience ?**

When i land on an ad on Youtube, it's fine, because i basically committed myself to the video by clicking on it, i want to watch it. This is a fair compensation for every party involved here. But when i'm not even allowed to know if the upcoming channel i've clicked will interest me anyway and i still have to watch an ad, this is just an awful user experience.

I'm so upset with the idea of switching channels on Twitch, to see what's up on other streams, that i will just close Twitch  and come back some other time when i'm **really bored** and willing to watch some obnoxious pre-stream ads.

In conclusion, this is not a complain about ad's on Twitch, its a complain about a ruined viewing experience that makes me think that, maybe some other platform will offer me a better one and don't make me feel like shit after watching THE SAME Amazon Prime ads for the 50x this week...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/do7hku/this_is_why_twitch_is_digging_their_own_grave/,1572261825.0,2430,0.95,393,Twitch,Marvel2002

dmypgh,Loots is being sued,"I've just had them around as an option for people to support, but got this email this morning:

&gt;
Esteemed streamers,
&gt;
loots has come under fire and is now facing legal threats by one of the major players in our industry which came totally out of the blue to us.
&gt;
As this is now an ongoing legal process, we will not be able to share every single detail, but we will be as transparent as possible and provide more info within the next few days.
&gt;
To give you at least some context: The legal dispute deals with the question whether streamers are allowed to monetize their live content through sponsorships and advertising, and whether they are allowed to use services like loots to do so.
&gt;
To protect your loots accounts and future payouts we decided to enter into preliminary insolvency proceedings (similar to Chapter 11 in the US). With that, we now have three months to solve the underlying legal issues and get back to normal.
&gt;
IMPORTANT: About your payouts
&gt;
If you have received any unpaid Sponsored Messages before October 24th we unfortunately will not be able to pay you until further notice as all our funds are frozen until further notice – we know that sucks big time, and we are terribly sorry for that.
 &gt;
Rest assured, we are working super hard together with the insolvency administrator to pay you at least a certain percentage of what we owe you as soon as possible.
&gt; 
&gt;
But there are some good news, too:
All unpaid Sponsored Messages you have received after October 24th, will be paid out on time. Even better, we will reduce the payout period from 45 days to 14 days and also give you a 50% bonus.
&gt;
Your next payout date will be Thursday, November 17th.
&gt;
&gt;
We will keep you posted about any further developments on our end.
&gt;
Keep the faith, you are our life blood!
&gt;
Yours truly,
Your dedicated loots Team

dlianz,"Should trolls be allowed to stay in chat if the streamer isn't bothered by them, but they start going after viewers?","Last night I was in a stream, and a troll was in chat, saying really horrible things to the streamer.  However, she wasn't bothered at all.  She told the mods not to ban him, and her chat found his horrible behavior amusing as well.  But then...someone raided her stream and brought new viewers in.

The troll immediately started going after people from the raid, telling others to ""F off and die""  making them uneasy.

dkx4li,A fellow Streamer Being Toxic,"I was streaming some Golf With Friends when someone joined my Discord (first time streaming with more than my gf and I didn't think anyone would do that. I took the risk and rip), joined voice, and then started playing this song that had some *bad* words in it. I was able to ban him from my server and I feel like I moved past it just fine. After I got done streaming I noticed that he had clipped what happened.   


He never said anything in chat. He did mess up by using the same name in Discord as he did with clipping. So I know it's  him for sure. The thing is the person is at least an affiliate since he has a sub button. I know they know that using racial slurs is not okay since in their latest VOD someone says it in their chat and once they see it they just go ""okay...."" and leave it there.

dk2qae,Streaming tip: Backup and keep copies of your VODs.,"In todays short Saturday morning PSA, I wanted to point out (in the case that you aren't already doing this) that you should always keep copies of your past streams, even if you think they are garbage. There are three reasons for this:

- You may think you suck and your content is trash, but looking back on what you've done is a great way to see how far you've come. Reviewing these from time to time can give valuable insight into what you can do to be better and what your strengths are. 

- Sadly, I learned from personal experience that there are content thieves out there who have no problem stealing and plagiarizing the work of other creators. You may want or need to dispute them someday and will need proof.

- You may want to branch out into other areas of creation someday, such as video editing, and your streams can be a great tool to help you practice those skills without having to worry about copyright or licensing.

There are surely other reasons out there to keep records of your data, but I wanted to keep this short because it's Saturday and I ain't got time for dis shit.

djolwy,Twitch is looking to expand Transcode availability by the end of the year,"In case you're not familiar with the term ""transcoding"", it basically means having video quality options on your stream.

As part of their new [""Picture-by-Picture"" Ads Experience](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/picture-by-picture-ads) FAQ, this is what they write as an answer to the question ""Does every streamer get Picture-by-Picture?"" (relevant part is highlighted):

&gt;Partners who are streaming games will get Picture-by-Picture. Most Affiliates will get it when they have Transcode enabled on their stream. Without Transcode enabled, picture-by-picture may deliver a negative experience for viewers due to bandwidth constraints. **We are looking to expand Transcode availability by the end of the year.**

The fact that they're looking to expand their Transcode availability in general isn't news, but the time frame they specify is interesting.

This is in line with their Squad Stream announcement at TwitchCon Europe earlier this year where they stated that they will start rolling out Squad Stream [to Affiliates later this year](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/414957525?t=1h0m0s). In order for that to happen, they would definitely need to expand their Transcode availability considering it requires transcoding (as mentioned in their [How to Use Squad Stream](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-squad-stream) FAQ). I was looking forward to hearing something more about this at TwitchCon San Diego a couple of weeks back, but they completely left that out in the cold.

Here's hoping Affiliates will be guaranteed transcoding sooner rather than later, along with the announced Squad Stream option!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/djolwy/twitch_is_looking_to_expand_transcode/,1571410365.0,321,0.98,57,Twitch,HaznoTV

To my surprise I actually got a few followers and a little bit of chat interaction. I don't have a second monitor to view chat so I have to use the pop out chat and resize my game window to see both. Also completing some of the starting achievements is a real big motivation to keep streaming the next day.

die93l,Pro-Tip: The most impactful way to support a streamer is just type in the chat more often.,"**Post is edited/revised**

A lot of small streamers out here struggle to get out of the under 10 viewers hump. The biggest issue is because nobody is chatting and every one of their ~5 viewers are lurking in the shadows. It's 10x harder to come up with something to say AND still be entertaining when you're talking to a nobody.

Of course there are a lot of things you can come up with to speak about. It's okay if you do this for couple of mins but if you're constantly having to rely on talking to yourself for 10+ min stretches (due to silence), it's harder to retain viewership. The big reason why people suggest you talk no matter how silent it is, is so your viewers know that you're not bored. But really. Is it being yourself if you have to do this for long periods of time at once? Because over time this can take away the enjoyment doing this. It kinda feels like you're being ignored.

As a viewer, do you really want to see someone talk for 10+ mins with nobody talking and think they're more entertaining than talking to at a conversation? The big reason why people watch streams isn't mainly because they're interactive or entertaining and engaging on stream. It's because they have a promising community. Having no chat messages at all for long periods of time would make a viewer think the community is just dead. 

I've found a correlation in chat messages and average viewers by looking at post-stream stats (up until 1 month ago). At the 5 min stretches where the chat had fewer than 1 message or 10+ mins of blank chat, I averaged 5 viewers compared to 15. Yes it's true. It's psychologically more engaging to watch a conversation rather than someone speaking to nobody over time.

And so 1 month ago, I asked one of my biggest supporters, my real life friend I've known since middle school, just to chat more often and don't worry about gifting subs/donations. He really really wants my stream to grow. He tried to gift subs to others just to fire up the crowd. Unfortunately that has not been as impactful as what I asked him to do. And guess what? My average viewership 1 month has increased from 15 -&gt; 30 all because he said something every 2 mins. I averaged 2.15 messeages/min to 3.78. More people felt engaged and I started getting more non-gifted subs. A lot of people follow through on this.

There's always gonna be this ONE fan that would want to do whatever the fuck it takes for your channel to grow. And all you need is him/her to chat more often. I asked if he enjoyed chatting more often and he was like absolutely. I was surprised at how much stuff he was able to come up with. Sometimes 1 + 0 = 0 but 1 + 1 = 3. Yes it can go a long way. You don't have to rely on JUST that 1 person but I'm sure you have like 2-3 others who tune in to the majority of your streams just to show their support. 

That's not to say you should always COUNT on others to run the show but I've found that if the audience wants to engage with you actively, it helps in every dimension. Not only does it let viewers know he has a live community chatting but also makes the broadcaster's job a lot easier and not have to come up with something to say. You can try carrying the entire stream like Lebron carries the entire Cavs team but you're not gonna find as big of a success if nobody follows along. That's why a lot of big streamers become where they are. It's because either their chat is lively or they get a lot of viewers due to good gameplay. 

The thing is, Twitch's level of entertainment is a broadcaster:audience. It's not like some basketball game you watch where the announcers expect the audience to react. Twitch streaming is one of those entertainment platforms where engagement is the main reason people tune in. This doesn't apply if you're playing higher intensity games or if your main core value is gameplay-oriented.

dgefbo,Blind Accessibility On Twitch Is Getting Worse Please Help,"  

Hello Reddit, 

There are many parts of Twitch’s website that do not work with screen readers, and as a reference, a screen reader is a text-to-speech program that blind people use to navigate computers and other devices. Some examples of things that do not work with screen readers include using the main website to log in, working with the video manager, reading chat on the iOS app, and more. Furthermore, the new creator dashboard adds more inaccessible modals (a type of popup). An example of this is the new modal to change the stream title, game, tags, and other stream details. 

Currently, there are some ways around these issues like logging in on the help.twitch.tv page and using Nightbot to edit the title and game, but these solutions only cover some of the problems. Additionally, there might be more things that are inaccessible with the new creator dashboard that I haven’t found yet. 

It would be great if Twitch got into contact with a blind person or an accessibility consultant to go over some accessibility basics, and I don’t think the changes would be very time consuming, but I’m also not a developer. 

Despite these problems, I can still stream on Twitch, but blind people have to continue to find ways around the inaccessibility of the website. 

Please try to share this message with Twitch staff, or if you work for Twitch, please let the appropriate people know of these issues, and hopefully we can make Twitch more accessible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/dgefbo/blind_accessibility_on_twitch_is_getting_worse/,1570796820.0,471,0.94,54,Twitch,BlindlyPlayingGames

dbno7o,Step 1 | Acceptance that your content is not good enough is the first step to recovery,"I'd always assumed that all the posts asking for help getting viewers or talking more and well, general stream growth was just a tangential plug for their own stream in the hopes of getting people to check them out. But lately I'm starting to realize that maybe we, as content creators, view our own content much more favourably than others, to the point of being blind-sided.

I've been immediately shot down whenever I point out the *possibility* that they are not as entertaining as they thought, which leads me to believe I'm on to something, but that could also be because I'm being perceived as a dick or a troll. During my usual chitchat with streamers whenever I'm channel surfing, I slip this question in and the general answer I receive is somewhere along the lines of ""Yeah, I think I'm pretty entertaining. Maybe not the most entertaining streamer in the world, but ... Nobody gives me a chance"". Because of this, maybe all these pleas for help with viewership and growth is not out of a sense of entitlement, but *genuine confusion about their lack of growth despite ""everything being right""*.

**What are the implications if we decide to accept that our content has room for improvement?** The most insightful response I got was ""Why would I bother doing it if I thought my content wasn't good enough?"". I found this to be so profound that I was immediately able to relate this to what I'd read in a self-improvement book which said that *we are under the wrong impression that ""acceptance"" is ""admitting defeat""*. And I can understand this perspective. If we admit that we are not entertaining enough, then it is equivalent to admitting we are not ""good enough"" which is something that causes mental pain. Our brain would rather deny this than face the pain. However, only after acceptance can come improvement. If you don't think you have a problem, then you are not inclined to ""solve"" a problem that you don't have.

The best analogy I found for this situation is Step 1 in the Twelve Step Program for recovering alcoholics (feels like an extreme analogy, so please suggest a better one).

&gt;Abandon pride and seek humility: Once you admit your problems and  mistakes, you will find modesty and humbleness. You can’t admit embrace  powerlessness if you’re still holding on to your pride.

Sadly, the people that need to hear this will either not bother or downvote this to hell, but I'm interested to hear the opinions of the rest. Also, the next question is, what comes after? How do we identify what needs to improve and go about it.

Edit:

Thank you for all your amazing comments! It gladdens my heart that there are so many people in this subreddit with self-awareness. You guys should post and comment more, so that we can discuss about strategies to improve content, and reduce the percentage of ""how to get viewers"" threads. It's definitely an eye-opening experience for me, because I thought 90% of small streamers are in that denial state, but that was a really pessimistic estimate.

The common thread I see is *""I've realized that I need to improve my content, but I don't know what I need to improve!""*. Guys, if I fucking had any idea how to create good content, I'd be out there busting my ass creating content XD. All I can say is, if you hang around this subreddit and pay attention to the comments, even in those stupid ""how to get viewers"" threads, you'll find there are a bunch of people with some **solid advice**, which is more often than not ignored, so I suggest you get in touch with them, because those guys are more than happy to help. They even go to the lengths of looking at your vods and suggesting improvements, and of course there's that feedback megathread.

dadq7o,"We need to talk about the ""Music and Performing Arts"" category","Hey everyone! Excuse me for anything that I might not know, I'm very new to the content creation side of Twitch (and reddit, for that matter). Recently I've started a channel that focuses entirely on music, we have a diverse range of content from live jam sessions featuring all different kinds of local artists, to solo beat making streams done by one of our members, and we run everything out of a professional recording studio. I know most people think of Twitch as a gaming platform, but I believe it has a lot of potential to support many different kinds of media.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's the problem, why am I making this post?

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the ""Music and Performing Arts"" category is almost completely dominated by a lot of ""24 hour radio"" type channels. These channels almost never feature anyone doing anything live, and mostly run loops of the same content. Now that's fine, there is obviously a demand that type of content, and I don't think it needs to be removed, but it makes it extremely difficult for musician's and other types of artists to catch viewer's attention. Imagine if you went to the Super Smash Bros. category and a good 75% percent (if not more) of the streams were just games of bots fighting each other without any human input or commentary. Even the best players would have a really hard time getting started on the platform. In my opinion, this is the reason the ""Music and Performing Arts"" category really doesn't get a lot of viewers in the first place. I get that most people are on Twitch for gaming, but even if someone decides ""Hey, I want to check out some random live music,"" They're going to have a really difficult time finding it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do we do about it? Well, I think there's a fairly simple solution, create a new category for the ""radio station"" channels. If this were to be done, both the radio stations and the performers would have a much more clear home on Twitch making it WAY easier for viewers to find the type of content they're looking for. Also, artists will feel more inclined to use Twitch as their platform if they know they aren't going to be lumped in with a bunch of automated channels. You can imagine the types of content that might start popping up. I would love to see strange avant garde performance pieces, or maybe even some sort of play or skit that changes depending on what the chat wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

People are creative, and there's nothing I love more than seeing other artists use their creativity and talents in interesting ways. I think Twitch is such a good platform for that because of it's interactive nature and the way it allows people to build communities.

&amp;#x200B;

So, there are my thoughts on an issue that I'd bet a lot of people on here haven't ever really considered. I'd love to discuss   this, let me know what you guys think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/dadq7o/we_need_to_talk_about_the_music_and_performing/,1569661877.0,96,0.88,19,Twitch,Tryplow

da5syc,Today I had a stream that reaffirmed Twitch definitely IS for me.,"First off this isn't an ""I made it"" thread. Kind of the opposite actually. I've been streaming since June and made affiliate July 4th. It was completely a fluke. I was streaming Rebel Galaxy, an indie title with a small enough Dev that they retweeted when I went live. The perfect storm happened that epic game store, love them or hate them, was giving that title away for free in anticipation of the upcoming prequel. Regardless I owe everything to double damage games. 

The hype wore off the series and my viewership dropped after most people had moved on from the prequel RG Outlaw. My Dad flew in for a few weeks from Canada and my baby got a cough she is just now kicking so streaming sort of took a back seat. It was always for fun anyway. I only wanted affiliate to see if I could get it honestly. 

So now it's late September and I'm considering hanging it up. Not because I'm sad or feeling a failure or anything I just wondered if it's worth my time. I figured screw it. Full fun mode. Screw the rules like ""don't stream super popular games"" I just want to have fun and hang out. 

Finally my long winded story comes to the point. I was playing Code Vein today. A brand new action rpg nothing like what I'd done before. I'm messing around, dying cause I suck at even this easy version of a souls-like and all the sudden I see a question in chat. ""Is this really anime vampire dark souls?"" I remember to read the question aloud for the benefit of my 2 lurkers and tell him well it depends. It's inspired by it but much easier. He tells me that's a relief cause he, like me, sucks at soulsborn but loves the style. We chat while his copy installs (I guess bamco owes me thanks for making a sale) and he eventually tells me he has made his character. This is about when I was ending my stream to go to work anyway so I say good luck and that's it. 

Nothing really stuck me as amazing until I'm at work in analysis mode and I look up the game. 40k viewers with some streamers in high triple digits. This person went by all of them to engage me. Something I'm doing caught this one person's eye and he chose me. Wow. 

So now I have a new motto: if I can entertain one person, make them laugh, or guide them to a game they will like so they can enjoy dozens if not hundreds of hours of vampire anime breasteses it's worth it. My point/justification of posting this here is maybe we all wont be the next Ninja or Drift0r but maybe we don't need to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/da5syc/today_i_had_a_stream_that_reaffirmed_twitch/,1569614917.0,104,0.84,22,Twitch,Septiimus
da1psp,Following option removed. This is bad for channel moderators!," 

Hello,

The new layout is fine, light mode is a bit iffy, but very few people use that. However there is one major issue with the new UI. I can no longer see which channels another user follows, the option has completely disappeared, and I haven't found a solution by tweaking the URL either.

Why is this important? It's not, Unless you moderate a channel. The ability to see who someone follows is a huge deal for moderators because:

* Trolls, trolls like to make lots of new accounts, and being able to see more than just ""This persons account is 3 days old"" helps a lot. ( A 3 day old account that is only following 1 person, can be someone trying to evade punishment, or a 3 day old account that is following hundreds if not thousands of accounts can be identified as a bot )
* More often than not the people that cause trouble have multiple twitch accounts, and the majority of them are quite stupid. They follow each other. I caught someone the other day who was a long time member of a stream shouting out abuse to everyone in chat. We timed him out for 10 minutes, but before his timeout was up another user name into chat, and said something horrible ""I hope you all get murdered"" or some shit. Low and behold after looking at the new users account we were able to work out that both the person we timed out for 10 minutes, and the person we just punished were following each other. Aka the same person. Then followed another account, and again they were all following each other.
* Warning friends, It was a really helpful option if to see who someone is following, so if they for example came into your chat and said something really inappropriate racist/homophobic or whatever, and you saw they were following x,y,z who you know on twitch. You would want to warn them that this person could be bad for their community based on what they said in your stream.

It's also a nice feature in general. It's nice if you make new friends on twitch and want to check out who they are following, people generally follow things they like, and if you like watching their stream you will probably enjoy the channels they follow too.

I just feel like this change was a huge oversight, you're just making things easier for trolls.

I did a little test stream, because I haven't streamed in a while, and I updated OBS, which ruined some of my settings, so now because of the test stream, I know I need to change stuff again.

But I was cautiously aware of what I was saying, and it made it awkward for me, because I know the other people in my house can also hear me.

How do I get over the awkwardness?

7t4hkk,Valve responds to ESL's DCMA takedowns of independent Twitch streams,"http://blog.dota2.com/2018/01/dotatv-streaming/

We’ve been seeing a bunch of discussion regarding DotaTV and want to expand on what we’ve said before.

The first issue we’ve been seeing discussed is regarding DMCA notices. This one is very simple: No one besides Valve is allowed to send DMCA notices for games streamed off of DotaTV that aren’t using the broadcasters’ unique content (camera movements, voice, etc).

The second issue is regarding who is permitted to cast off of DotaTV. We designed the DotaTV guidelines to be flexible in order to allow for up and coming casters, or community figures like BSJ or Bulldog that occasionally watch tournament games on their channel, to be able to stream off of DotaTV. It is not to allow commercial organizations like BTS to compete with the primary stream. It’ll be our judgment alone on who violates this guideline and not any other third party’s.

Help Portal: https://obsproject.com/help

Patch Notes:

* **Scripting**
    * Added Luajit/Python3 scripting support. Scripting can be accessed via the ""Tools"" menu -&gt; ""Scripts"".
    * Lua is supported via Luajit, which comes with the program. Lua is recommended for high performance scripts, automation, and sources.
    * Python is available if access to its convenient libraries is desired. On windows, to use Python, Python version 3.6 must be installed separately (""x86-64"" version if 64bit OBS Studio, ""x86"" version if 32bit OBS Studio), and the Python 3.6 install path must be configured in the Python settings tab.
    * Scripting documentation can be found in the developer documentation: https://obsproject.com/docs/scripting.html
    * Added an example Lua script: An ""Analog Clock"" source which draws an analog clock (added like any other source when the script is active)
    * Added an example Lua script: A ""Countdown Timer"" script which sets the text of a text source to a countdown timer which counts down when that text source is displayed on stream.
    * Added an example Lua script: An ""Instant Replay"" script which automatically save a replay if there's an active replay buffer, and then plays back that replay in a specified media source after that replay has saved.
    * Added an example Python script: A ""URL Text"" script which sets the text of a specified text source to the text downloaded from a specified URL every specified interval.

* **New Audio Features**
    * Added [sidechain/ducking support to the compressor filter](https://puu.sh/z4yKl/b5b0d21cc4.gif). This allows the ability to lower the audio level of an audio source based upon how loud another source is. For example, to apply microphone ducking to a desktop audio source, add a compressor filter to the desktop audio source, then select the microphone audio source in the ""Sidechain/Ducking Source"" property.
    * Added [surround sound audio output support](https://puu.sh/z0c4b/055b60be62.gif), which allows outputting 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 5.1, and 7.1 audio to stream/recording. (When using this feature, please also make sure to increase your audio bitrate to support all the channels in output settings. Although some services like Twitch support it, note that certain services such as YouTube may not fully support surround sound streaming, and may not downmix them correctly for stereo viewers)
    * Added [new audio meters](https://puu.sh/yWyPD/b5fd44c89f.gif) to allow the ability to see the audio levels of each audio channel of that source. This allows the ability to know if there are any issues with a specific audio channel (e.g. if just the left or right audio channel is somehow low or muted).
    * Changed audio meters to behave like peak programme meters. This will make it easier to see if your audio is clipping and set your audio levels correctly. For more information, see: https://obsproject.com/wiki/Understanding-The-Mixer
    * Added an ""Audio Meter Decay Rate"" option in audio settings to allow selecting a specific delay rate (fast, medium, slow) for the audio meters if desired.
    * Added the [ability to rename audio sources](https://puu.sh/z0bAW/d88db7730a.gif) via right-clicking them in the audio mixer, including desktop and microphone audio capture sources added via audio settings.

* **New Production and Studio Mode Features**
    * Added a [""Multiview"" projector](https://puu.sh/z5miv/c26b53afab.gif) (accessible via the View menu), which allows the ability to view the preview/program and up to 8 scenes at the same time. Scenes in the Multiview can be clicked to change the scene (or the preview scene in studio mode). You can blacklist certain scenes from displaying in the multi-view by right-clicking the scene in the scenes list and unchecking ""Show in Multiview"". You can also change the Multiview's layout style in general settings.
    * Added an option in general settings that allows you to transition to a scene in studio mode simply by double-clicking on it. This also applies to the multiview projector.
    * Added separate projectors for both preview and program views in studio mode.
    * Added a [portrait/vertical layout option](https://puu.sh/z5mDu/2d32292f80.gif) for studio mode in general settings which makes the preview/program views vertical relative to each other instead of horizontal
    * Added [per-scene transition overriding](https://puu.sh/z0fK1/3b169a0994.gif), which allows you to select a specific transition to use for a specific scene. To use this feature, right-click on the scene in the scene list, and select the transition/duration via the right-click context menu. (This override does not apply to studio mode quick transitions)

* **Developer Documentation**
    * Spent about a week or so and finally wrote full developer API documentation/reference (useful for both native and script developers), which can be found here: https://obsproject.com/docs

* **Other General Changes and Fixes**
    * Added a [new program theme: Acri.](https://imgur.com/a/T831b)
    * Changed the [default program theme to dark mode](https://puu.sh/yWOLl/4a76b77e3b.gif) for new users.
    * Changed the text of ""Multi-adapter Compatibility"" in game capture to ""SLI/Crossfire Capture Mode (Slow)"". This was changed because the wording ""Multi-adapter Compatibility"" was a bit vague, and users are not typically aware of the potential performance impact when using the option.
    * Optimized the preview pane and reduced GPU usage by 2-8% depending on how many sources were in the preview.
    * The streaming/recording buttons in the main window now highlight while streaming/recording.
    * Fixed a bug on Windows where desktop audio capture could go slightly out of sync with display/game/window capture on certain audio devices
    * Fixed an issue where certain Elgato devices would not output audio by default, and would require users to select the audio device manually.
    * Fixed a bug with studio mode where scenes that are set to fully duplicate would not retain their filters.
    * Fixed a stuttering bug on Linux with audio monitoring
    * Fixed MP3 audio support in the browser source on macOS
    * Fixed a few Dark/Rachni theme issues
    * Fixed a lot of minor bugs and a few minor memory leaks
    * Fixed a known crash that could happen on startup for certain AMD cards/drivers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7sbyw6/obs_studio_v21_released_luapython_scripting_new/,1516682271.0,330,0.96,97,Twitch,dodgepong

7rtdd4,"So about a week ago, I did my first charity stream...","**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT**

...and it went sucessfully. We raised $300 for ALS research, over a 16 hour stream from 8PM to 12PM. Now, we could end the story there, but that isn't the entire story. My Father suffers from PLS, a disease very similar to ALS and is treated and researched in much of the same ways. The disease forced him out of a job that he loved. He was Senior Director of Sales at a company that manufactures capacitors, and at that position he got to travel to and experience many exotic cities that he couldn't have at another job. He traveled all across the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. When he still had his job, he always told me he wanted to take me on one of his trips, particularly to Hong Kong. Of course, he couldn't do that because of his disease, and I am really sad that I couldn't take that trip with him. 

Now fast Forward to about 2-3 Weeks ago. I had this epiphany that I should run a charity stream, and while deciding what charity to raise money for, I thought of my dad, and subsequently I chose the ALS charity. I told my Mom and my siblings I was doing this, but not my Dad, as I wanted to keep it a surprise. Now, to raise as much dough as possible, I chose MLK weekend to do the 16 Hour stream as everyone would be off of work and school. So, I set that as the date and let everyone know. Fast forward to last Sunday, I start the stream, donating $10 that I had worked for that past week. Some lurkers had funneled in, and I was settling in on whatever game I was playing. Then all of the sudden, $50 dollars gets dropped! We had already hit $60, and my original goal of $100 was almost in reach about 20 minutes in. Then $5  and $1 drops in from a couple of friends, and then $24 and $10 came in shortly after! Just 1 hour in we raised 100 dollars, and I was astonished. As the night carried in, some people had to leave, but my brother comes in and drops $20, and says that this would mean a lot to our Dad and that he was proud of me. After some Call of Duty and Fortnite matches, we sat at 120 dollars for a while, and then my biggest regulars had to leave. The stream dragged on during the late hours, and some of my Pacific guys came in and said hi, and I also reunited with an old bud playing Fortnite. At 4:30, I switched back to Call of Duty, and some of my Regs come back. One dropped 30 dollars to bump me to 150, and another streamer that I network with a lot drops 50 as well! At that point, I was sitting at 200 dollars at around 5:30 AM. The same streamer who dropped 50 tweets my stream out, and his friend drops 50 bucks to me and gives me a follow! At this point, I was all giddy, I had gone from 254 followers to around 260, and we had raised 250 dollars, almost $1 per follower. At around 7:30-8 AM, some of my teammates in the ORG im part of dropped some dough, getting me to 280 dollars. They had to leave to go to work after they donated, but they cheered me on for a bit before leaving. Some more randoms came into the stream from 9-11AM, getting new followers and some song requests in. Then, as the stream was wrapping up, my other teammate drops in and throws 20 dollars at me to bump me to 300 dollars. Even though I was really tired, I was lit up like a light bulb at that big $300 staring me down. 12PM past, and I hosted my teammate who carried on the fun for whoever was watching earlier. I got off, ran outside for a bit, then took a shower and napped. 

A few days later, I print out my results from the charity site I was using, Tiltify, and brought my Mom into my Dad's room, where he was watching the news on a Wednesday night. She starts taking video on my phone, while I reveal the news to my dad. He was lit up the entire time, being as articulate as his body would allow him to, as he can't talk very well due to the PLS. His face was pink and he told me how proud he was that I had pulled this off for him. I hugged my dad, and we had dinner after, wrapping up a nice night. 

I have to say though, I did not expect 300 dollars to be the result of the stream. That's more than $1 for each follower I have! Everyone had told me the same. Needless to say, If I could go through that again, I would, and I would stream for longer as well.

If anyone wants to see my Dad's reaction, its on my YT. It's very heartwarming :)

7qbqiz,What legal responsibilities do Twitch have regarding cyberbullying on their platform? What do I do if I am a victim of cyberbullying as a streamer or moderator?,"With the drama in Taiwan and potential legal implications with regards to cyberbullying under the Personal Information Protection Act (link to other reddit post removed to prevent auto delete), I would like to know what similar processes and procedures exist stateside within the US. 

In particular, what are Twitch's responsibilities with regards to cyberbullies and what are my responsibilities as a broadcaster?

What procedures should be followed regarding domestic vs. foreign cyberbullies? Is there a hotline in the US to report cyberbullying? Or is this handled by local law enforcement?

For foreign matters, can a victim streamer contact foreign law enforcement and submit reports through their reporting channels? Is there a US organization that facilitates this?

As a moderator, what happens if I am the victim of cyberbullying due to association with a different user’s channel?

Background: I have my own stateside (Metro DC) IRL channel (reedog117) but have also streamed internationally in multiple countries including UK, Taiwan, and France. I also mod for an international American streamer as well as another streamer who runs a Social Eating/Talk Show channel discussing controversial issues.

Also scrolling down really fast seems to occasionally cause lag on the thumbnails.  

Page numbers to click would be a great way to add functionality to the website, and also get a little more traffic flowing to the smaller streamers on the last pages.

7q1xvp,Some information I gathered for Variety Streaming,"**This information would go best with those who have built their community based off a single game (which most are like this).**

-----

I've seen about 10 posts in the last 2 weeks about ""Variety Streaming and  how to go about it"". This led me to want to collect data about best methods that I've been doing for a while now to maintain the most viewers possible, even when switching games. 

- Stats gathered from StreamLabs/StreamElements/Twitch Stats Dashboard.

 - Now, this won't work the same way for everyone but it's information for those who haven't tested it themselves.

*Slight background info on my channel:*

For my channel, I started my stream built around PUBG. Games I introduced were CSGO/Battlefield 1/COD:WW2. All are FPS games, so no change in genre.

- 6 hour average streams
- 60 viewers average daily
- 70 - 80 viewers peak @ ~ 3 hours 
 - (I think 3 hours is the shortest you should ever stream, in my year of streaming I get to the max amount of people at this point. This means most visibility for you.)

-------

**Four different ""tests"":**

- (1) Started with my most popular game and played for 4 hours before switching
- (2) Started with my most popular game and played for 2 hours before switching
- (3) Started with the game I wanted to play rather than my most popular game
- (4) Started with IRL for an hour and then played random game

*The stats (all averaged) were as follows:*

**(1)** - Started normal. Within 3 hours I was at my max viewers of 60 - 70. Continued to stream until 4 hours was up and then went to my new game. Views dropped to 40 - 50 but stood stable there for the rest of the night. Did this in the past as well so I had a lot of data already collected (about a month worth)

**(2)** - Started normal again. Within 2 hours I was around high 50s in  viewers (odd that I never hit 70 unless I did 2 hours and 30min +). Once I stopped after 2 hours I dipped to high 40s, low 50s on the new game. Repeated for 5 days. No real change in how much I dropped.

**(3)** - Started with the game I wanted to play without building up my viewers first. People came in and left almost instantly once they saw I was playing another game instead. Got to 20 viewers max after 2 hours of streaming. Averaged 20 viewers through my 4 hour 30 min average. Repeated for four days (couldn't bare to watch it happen anymore) on the usual most popular days for me (Thursday/Friday; I get my highest average/highest max viewers on these days). 

**(4)** - Started with IRL for an hour. Viewers got up to about 35 after this. Once I changed to the new game it dipped to around ~25 viewers. Stood around this number and peaked once at 35 again before dipping. Have about 5 days worth of this as I couldn't bare to see my numbers under 60 average (trying to get the 75 average viewers so I can feel worthy of partnership).

----

*I know this isn't a lot of days for data but it's still data. Can't bare to see my viewers low as I'm looking to apply for partnership soon and wish for my average viewership for a few months to be as high as possible.*

**What it showed me:**

- Starting with my most popular game for as long as possible and then introduce my new game allows me to keep my viewership as high as possible during it.
 - Not really sure why a lot of people stood if I did my most popular game first and then switched. Possibly, AFK/just had it as background noise at that point/etc.

- Starting without building my viewership up first ended up causing my viewership to stay low as most aren't there for that game.

----

**To sum it up, TL;DR:**

- Max viewers/average viewers reached after 3 hours of playing most popular game on my channel.
- Most popular game played for 2 hours before switching to new game kept viewers as high as possible on new game.
- Starting without most popular game caused my viewers to stay at 33% my usual viewership.

Best thing to do if you want to stream something else:

- Stream most popular game for 2 hours and then dive into the new game. This will keep the decline in viewers at it's minimum and you'll have a decent number of viewers even on the new game.

7occ50,"How to use StreamLabs OBS ""smart video encoding"" with OBS Studio","tl;dr skip to 'The settings'

## Intro

First off, the ""custom encoders"" mentioned in the [SLOBS announcement](https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs-livestreaming-reinvented-4ddf8324f395) are just modified presets(/settings) for x264, which means they can be easily used with OBS Studio. The downside is that you have to change the settings manually each time you switch games unless someone writes a plugin for that.

It's also not really clear what the benefits really are, as the devs stated that the [CPU usage of SLOBS is on par with OBS](https://clips.twitch.tv/UnsightlyPowerfulMeerkatTBTacoLeft).

## Where is this coming from

The SLOBS x264 settings can be found in the program's source [here](https://github.com/stream-labs/streamlabs-obs/blob/staging/app/services/video-encoding-optimizations/definitions.ts)

It seems support for this ""smart video encoding"" is limited to x264, and despite what the announcement claimed, is only available to PUBG, League of Legends, Fortnite, and Destiny 2

There are two presets which serve as the base for the settings:

* Medium: 'Optimized profile for average CPUs', based on x264 preset 'veryfast'
* Low: 'Optimized profile for weak CPUs', based on x264 preset 'ultrafast'

## The settings

For OBS Studio, navigate to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Output, set ""Output Mode"" to ""Advanced"". The settings can only be used if encoder is set to x264. What you'll modify is ""CPU Usage Preset"", and ""x264 Options""

### CS:GO and Dota 2
There are no special settings for those two.

## Fun Facts
The Medium settings for PUBG, LoL, and D2 are exactly the same, and FN as well as Generic only contain one change.
FN uses `me=hex` instead of `me=dia`. 'me' stands for motion estimation. According to [this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MeGUI/x264_Settings#me) 'hex' ""is considerably more efficient than dia and hardly any slower, and therefore makes a good choice for general-use encoding."".
Generic's only change is the decrease of `bframes` from 3 to 2.

Pretty interesting that StreamLab's ""machine learning"" determined that there is basically no difference between PUBG, LoL, D2, FN, and any other type of content in terms of how they should be encoded more efficiently/""smarter"".

There are more changes in ""Low"" profiles (especially for LoL), but I'm not qualified to comment on what they affect and by how much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7occ50/how_to_use_streamlabs_obs_smart_video_encoding/,1515170074.0,73,0.94,42,Twitch,ZeForte

**Update 2:** [Swatting suspect charged with involuntary manslaughter](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article194441604.html)

**Update:** [LAPD: Los Angeles man arrested in connection to deadly 'swatting' call in Wichita](http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Two-critically-injured-in-W-Wichita-shooting-467049153.html) - *KWCH12*

[Kansas man killed, unintended victim of 'swatting' prank](https://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article192111974.html) - *The Wichita Eagle*

A somber note as we round out the year with news of a swatting incident resulting in a fatality; reportedly due to a heated argument between CoD players and law enforcement being sent to a random house. With the incident being recent and the information being sifted and verified, take note to read carefully and thoroughly from news sources. Also, pursuant to Reddit's [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and especially Rule #1 of this subreddit; no comments that are witchhunting, harassing, threatening, or bullying are allowed. Take care to read the rules of /r/Twitch.

For those unfamilar, 'swatting' is

&gt; false[ly] reporting an emergency to public safety by a person for the intent of getting a (“SWAT
team”) response to a location where no emergency exists. -*911.gov*

which results in wasted effort by law enforcement, emergency responders and can cause harm and/or fatalities to the people involved.

There are ways to protect yourself and it does start with you and being proactive.

- Safeguard your personal information: it's no surprise that this is the very first item on the list. Strong passwords, being cognizant of what you put online; folks of a less savory nature can't exploit information they don't have.

- Speak with your local law enforcement: let them know that you may be a potential target. They may come up with a protocol to make sure that the report is real. Reach out to them and they'll most certainly reach back to work with you.

- If law enforcement does arrive, make sure to comply: they may not know the situation! From their perspective, the report and the threat is very real and they treat it just as seriously. Once the situation has been defused, speak with law enforcement and continue to work with them.

Online actions have real world consequences and this goes both ways. Depending on the perpetrator, the severity of the false report and the events that transpire; punishments can range from a large fine and a felony on their record (in one case with a minor) all the way to a 20-year prison charge (for a man in the UK).

A shared sentiment no matter who you are, what you're doing, or where you are as we go into the 2018 New Year, be safe and be responsible.

7mnw6v,Don't blindly follow the herd when buying equipment,"I'm certain I will catch some flack for this, but I've never hid my opinions before. Here we go. 


**TLDR: Do research and think for yourself before blindly buying the same equipment everyone else uses**


Everyone uses a Blue Yeti. Everyone uses an Elgato capture card. Everyone goes on Amazon and buys the same green screen kit with soft boxes.



I'm positive those are quality pieces of equipment. I'm not here to say otherwise. My point is - is it the best for *your specific situation?*


Awhile back I upgraded from my headset to a standalone mic. I ended up purchasing a Samson G Track. I decided on this particular mic because of the supercardioid pickup pattern. In my mind, it is less likely to pick up potential background noise. How many of you know, without googling it right now, what pickup pattern your Blue Yeti has? Is it the most optimal for your situation? 


I purchased a Razer Ripsaw as my capture card. Granted, I don't use it much anymore because I play PC games instead of console. But the fact is I bought the Ripsaw over an Elgato because I like the features on the Razer. Again, I'm not bad-mouthing Elgato products. I'm positive they are quality, but are they right for you?


Instead of buying a green screen on Amazon I learned the principles behind what makes a green screen work, and made one. I bought two yards of fabric and some PVC pipe. I now have a perfectly functioning green screen for less than $20. The only lights in my room are the typical overhead light/fan combo, and a small clamp light behind my webcam. 



There are other examples, I'm sure. My point is: do your research and figure out the principles behind what makes this technology work. Figure out what works best for your specific situation, and don't buy something for the sole reason that a lot of people use it. Buy it because it's best for *you*.



To be clear. I'm not advocating everyone goes out and replaces their current tech. This post is more aimed at people who are already considering doing that or who don't have any tech yet.



**Edit:** since this post blew up more than expected, allow me to clarify a few things: 

- this post wasn't intended to be strictly about money. Yes, I mentioned it in the green screen to demonstrate *that* point. But the concept of ""what's best for you"" doesn't have to apply only to money. It could be ease of use, features you're looking for, quality in its particular area (IE audio, visual, etc), compatibility with your existing software/hardware, or yes money. Among any number of other factors. 

- I am not trying to push the brands that I use onto anyone. That is completely counter-intuitive to this post.

- I am not trying to say any particular brand is bad, shit, inherently faulty, or anything else.

- if you ""don't know what to google"" when doing your own research, start small: ""webcams for streamers"" (for example) and go from there. Learn as much as you can as you go, and form your own opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7mnw6v/dont_blindly_follow_the_herd_when_buying_equipment/,1514481381.0,112,0.79,85,Twitch,JW357

7m9tyh,Plead to merge the gaming sections of Age of Empires 2,"Dear Twitch Staff,

Please consider merging the two game sections on Twitch for Age of Empires 2:

[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Age%20of%20Empires%20II%3A%20The%20Conquerors)

[Age of Empires II: HD Edition](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Age%20of%20Empires%20II%3A%20HD%20Edition)

As it stands now, most of the biggest AoE2 streamers use the largest channel ""Age of Empires II: The Conquerors"", even when they are playing on HD, to attract the viewers, while new streamers who streams on HD might get overlooked as they might not be aware of this arbitrary split between the games. We are a relatively small community, and merging the two games would both make navigating easier and potentially attract more viewers to overlooked streams. It would be much appreciated if you would look into this issue!

7lod7m,[League of Legends] It is no longer possible to sort LoL streams by the streamer's in-game rank.,"On Twitch, under [Directory -&gt; Game -&gt; League of Legends](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20legends), the streamers currently streaming the game are shown. By default, they are sorted by number of viewers. 

Earlier this year, the option was added to sort the streams by the rank of the streamer, instead of the default of sorting the streams by the number of viewers. 

This option for sorting by the rank no longer exists. I'm not sure which update caused this removal of functionality, or when/why it was removed.

---

Some related information:

Twitch has a system ( in [Settings -&gt; Connections](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections) ) through which players could link their League of Legends accounts to their Twitch accounts. The way this is supposed to work is a four step process:

- the user gives Twitch what they claim to be their in-game name

- Twitch provides a code, in the format ttv-999999999

- the user renames one of their LoL in-game rune pages to match the code

- after short amount of time, Twitch (probably through Riot API) verifies that the user's rune page has been renamed to match the code

If these 4 steps are completed, then the Twitch account is linked to the LoL account.

This account linking broke down around the same time as the sort-by-rank functionality was removed, and I think both of these happened around the same time as the [preseason update that changed the LoL rune system occurred](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections), which went live on Nov 8th. 

This makes me think that what happened was that the fourth step in the verification process no longer works for account linking. This could be for one of two reasons:

- Twitch has not updated their account linking system to accommodate the new rune system (likely)

- Riot's API no longer allows external programs to see player's rune page names (unlikely).

---

**TL;DR: On its [League of Legends game directory page](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20legends), Twitch has removed the functionality of sorting streamers by their in-game rank. I suspect that this is because of the recent [change to the LoL rune system](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update), which Twitch uses to allow users to link their LoL and Twitch accounts.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7lod7m/league_of_legends_it_is_no_longer_possible_to/,1514031656.0,62,0.87,28,Twitch,z_42

7jb7si,Is it possible to see chat over your game-play on the same monitor?,"I checked around the sub and didn't quite see my question. I promise I looked :)!

Here's my question, elaborated.... I play League of Legends and sometimes my chat flies by. I'm the type of person who likes to read chat, while I play, and having Chat open on another screen kinda slows me down, and on a busy night, I miss stuff.

I'm not sure if this is possible- but has anyone found a technique to display chat *over* your gameplay, but invisible to OBS? I capture LoL with Game Capture, so another window that stays ""in-front"" would definitely work! I'd love to have chat on right side of my monitor while I play League. 

My Issue is that I'm not sure if you can keep a chat box ""Always In-Front"" like OBS's functionality. This would also prevent me from looking away for that one second and getting caught off guard while playing... FeelsBadMan.

Thanks for your time!

#2.**Alternative (I think this is better) From Baffler: (Screenshots in his post below)**

You can get it here: http://baffler.tv/Home/TwitchChatOverlay

Let me know if there's any issues or features you'd wanna see added. I'm happy to keep developing it and making it better.

Also, it requires .NET 4.5.2 or higher. You can download the latest .NET framework if you have any issues with it not working.

##Issue with this one- while it's on your screen, it's very easy to accidentally click on it and mess with your gameplay. I played League and I had this chat on the right side of my screen, I surprisingly click on that side more than I realized... so this one does not work for me during LoL. For settings info: I play in fullscreen bordeless.

#3.**One more alternate!** ^It ^looks ^pretty ^good ^too!

https://restream.io/chat - I haven't reviewed this one thoroughly myself, but I like the look.

###Final update- Thanks all for the support and ideas! I'll try a few out and maybe edit the final one that I like and will use!

7ivg7j,Make a Elgato Stream Deck for FREE,"Hello, everyone!

I have made a guide for my budget streamer buddies and wanted to share this with you all. I apologize in advance if any rules are broken, I did read them carefully before finally deciding to submit.

The Elgato Stream Deck is a wonderful piece of hardware but, it is a little steep in price for the average streamer. This alternative uses your mobile device, such as a spare phone or tablet, to use like a stream deck.

The software used in this guide is completely free and available to everyone to use.

https://imgur.com/a/hUgzk

Forgot to mention a couple things in the video itself.

1. The Roccat Power Grid software runs on your local network and nowhere else. This provides a secure connection without any 3rd party servers. Of course, if your internet drops off then so does the connection. At that point however, your stream probably went down also Kappa.

2. You can also launch websites and hotkeys for applications like Adobe products, etc.

Thanks for watching!﻿

I personally love twitch as a platform. I've been streaming on three different channels since 2011, and I got my own partnered channel in 2014.

I would have loved to see twitch become something parallel to, if not bigger than, YouTube (especially with gaming content), but with the BBC article above...

As the old saying goes, ""Any publicity is good publicity."" Well, more people are going to tune in. The bigger problem is, however, that people will be tuning in just to see for themselves what the IRL section has become.

7i9uaf,"PSA : Ban the Tolls, Even it it's Your Only Viewer","So I was chillin on the twitchverse and my favourite streamers were offline or just having lunch so as my wont, I wondered off around the 0 village at the bottom of the page.

Silent stream after silent stream passed by until I found a place where someone was talking. This was good!

Let me preface this by saying I tend to browse incognito, not because I hate talking, I just hate being called out k?

Anypoo, I'm sitting there, watching and listening to a reasonable streamer try to stay alive when lo and behold another person enters the chat! They say hi, the streamer gets visibly excited to see another person and asks newperson about their day, pretty standard fare... Newperson replies and the chat goes on from there. I'm enjoying this a little more and I'm just about to drop a follow and join the conversation when newperson starts to troll and troll hard.

Ive been on the receiving end of this, the chatter starts off as a human, gains trust and builds confidence with you and then they kick you in the proverbials out of left field.

The streamer just laughed it off, bantered back, assuming (incorrectly) that newperson was just joking, but they were not. Over the space of five minutes it just got worse and worse. The streamer, whether they were desperate, confused or just naive I don't know, they didn't do anything. It was like they froze. They carried on playing the game, however they played like they didn't care, they stopped commenting on the game and just verbally and mentally 'shut down'.
The troll carried on with the insults and put downs.

I whispered the streamer,  ""you should really ban that troll the command is /ban newperson"". I saw them read the message and I received a message back... ""nah at least they get me up the list in viewers""

I left.

TL;DR: Just ban the bastards. You will lose viewers and followers  if you have trolls that make you feel like shit. People pick up if you are feeling like shit whether on cam or just voice.

Why?
This bot will sit in your channel making a clickable and findable link in your viewer list for others. This is pretty bad as the bot links to, firstly, a follow for follow chat room on Twitch. But on further investigation it disguises itself as a bot for harvesting stats for your stream channel, on careful observation it requires access to viewing your stream key thusly making the creator of this bot have access to your twitch channel and make it possible to hijack.```

7goq83,State of /r/Twitch - Self-Promotion,"I am seeing this so often and it's becoming a reoccurring pattern where people think it's okay to do when it's kinda not and falls under self-promotion and reposting. A lot of people are going to downvote me and dislike my opinion and that's fine because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. 

The way I see it is people post threads like ""first time streaming and it was awesome"" or ""my experience as a streamer for x amount of months"" and along those lines which all feature the same format where they talk about whatever and or try to throw a curb on it that may seem like it's just a thread looking for feedback or sharing their ""experiences"" when they're not really qualified to do so by any means but boil it down and it's usually all for the same purpose which is to promote their channel in one way or another. I'm sure some will agree and others won't but it's getting pretty stale seeing the same posts over and over again. I can understand how people feel the need to talk about what excites them with their channel growth but I can't help but feel people just do it and think ""well maybe someone will like what I have to say and come to my channel."" which is real scummy by my standard.

Maybe I'm just taking an asinine approach to this and taking it the wrong way, if I am I apologize if it offends anyone but that's just kinda how I see it.

Also there is a vast infobase of everything you need to know if you just searched this subreddit or even google first before making a repost. 

**Edit #1: Possible Resolution**

Many have suggested a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly expressive megathread would help deflate the amount of reposts people make in regards to these types of topics and I agree that it's a fairly decent idea but it would have to be structured properly. I am sure the mods are figuring this out that will work for everyone with minimal uproar. That way everyone gets what they want with little to no sacrifice. Or perhaps maybe just individuals like this can actually read the twitch subreddit's rules and abide by them rather than trying to get past them and self advertise in any way that they can.

**Edit #2: Spotting the Difference**            

I feel like many people have touched base on this in regards to my post and they'll typically say ""well what's the point of /r/twitch then?"" or something like that which is fair to say but kind of wrongly assessed from the entire point of this thread discussion. My reply to them would be spotting the difference between someone who may be doing it to promote their channel and someone who is genuinely seeking advice on a matter that is important to them and others. It varies from situation to situation and it's really all about how it's perceived. At the end of the day I do not want to have others take away from these threads people make that are legitimate and constructive to the community after they've done their researched both here and on google to avoid reposts. To make a long story short it's all about discretion and obvious self-promoting which can usually be separated fairly easily from the actual posts of people seeking council. 

We all must also keep in mind that we are merely stating our opinions and that's all they'll ever be. It is not right of us to forcefully shove those opinions onto others then disrespecting them for not agreeing with them. We believe in freedom of speech so let's remember to allow everyone to exercise that right. Be respectful. Always.

**Reminder of Rule #3**   

&gt; Channel promotion is no longer permitted, as voted by this community. This includes, but is not limited to, stream promotion, including channel links in posts/comments, looking to collaborate and looking for feedback.

**Reminder of Rule #7**   

&gt; Repetitive topics will be removed - you should use the search function before posting. Repetitive topics covers anything that the community feels is posted too much. This list can be updated without warning, so make sure to check regularly!

**Additional Notes**   

&gt; You have to understand the amount of reposts on this subreddit. While I think it's great that people want to share their experiences, they also have to understand that their experiences have been said many times over before by others. People need to learn how to search for things instead of just cluttering up this subreddit with repeated topics.

* Twitch Console app (PS4 / Xbox) quality assurance / stability assurance.     
* iOS app needs increased support.
* Clarification of rules of what can and cannot get a channel suspended and/or banned.
* Create a platform that is better than YouTube for people who want to make gaming videos. So many people are complaining about the Adpocalypse.

7frgaa,"If you think things aren't going well behind the scenes at Twitch you're not alone, actual Twitch employees think things aren't going well.","According to the Twitch employee reviews from glassdoor which [you can read here](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Twitch-Reviews-E639426.htm?sort.sortType=RD&amp;sort.ascending=false&amp;filter.employmentStatus=REGULAR&amp;filter.employmentStatus=PART_TIME&amp;filter.employmentStatus=UNKNOWN#) (you need to be signed into glassdoor to view the actual reviews) Twitch is currently not in a good state behind the scenes. The ratings for the company have just nosedived from where they were in late 2016 of last year. During late 2016, the company had a 4.5 star rating, ~85% of employees would recommend working there to a friend, ~95% of employees approved of the ceo, ~85% of employees had a positive business outlook for the company. Currently, Twitch is sitting at 2.9 stars, 43% would recommend working there to a friend, 44% of employees approve of the CEO, and 37% of employees have a positive business outlook for the company. So why is this? Well after looking through some reviews written by Twitch employees here are some common themes:

* By all accounts the Twitch CEO is terrible at managing his company. [One reviewer thinks Emmett seems to only care about managing his projects and ideas rather than the needs and ideas of his employees](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17215978.htm). Another reviewer states Twitch employees [openly mock the CEO for his incompetence.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17824973.htm) Another reviewer notes that at many of their product reviews, Emmett apparently [screams at his employees](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Twitch-Reviews-E639426_P4.htm?sort.sortType=RD&amp;sort.ascending=false). And almost every review I read negatively criticizes the CEO in some way. That doesn't sound like good management to me.
* Many employees noted the lack of a clear and coherent vision for the future. One reviewer stated that one week Emmett told his team to build something and completely forgot about it stating [""Emmett has the classic new CEO quirk of being easily swayed by the last enthusiastic person who speaks to him.""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Twitch-Reviews-E639426_P4.htm?sort.sortType=RD&amp;sort.ascending=false) Another reviewer noted that the company is suffering from [Not-Invented-Here syndrome.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17824973.htm) Not-Invented-Here syndrome from what I can tell  is the rash need by programmers to reinvent the wheel every time they want to change their code. [\(Source\)] (https://www.developer.com/design/article.php/3338791/Overcoming-quotNot-Invented-Herequot-Syndrome.htm) If programmers and coders are suffering from NIHS lots of money and time is being wasted coding things that don't need to be coded which is likely a sign of poor management. One other reviewer states that [""Everyone works in their own silo and if something goes wrong, there's a lot of finger pointing and ""it was his/her stupid idea"". It makes people question whether or not they even know what they're doing.""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17328257.htm) The reviewer then goes on to blame the Chief of Staff/Program director (he's not sure what her job title is) saying most of the Twitch staff have no idea what she does. Other Twitch employees have told the reviewer that she apparently acts belligerently and makes ridiculous requests for other employees and gets away with it because she's Emmett's right hand. This doesn't sound like a fun company to code for.
* Several people noted that Amazon's culture and Twitch's culture are actively damaging one another. One reviewer says [half the employees in Twitch report to Twitch's CEO and the other half report to Amazon's special CEO.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17988901.htm) They also say that the two halves pretend to work together, but function more like separate entities (hence the silo comparison they make). Another reviewer notes that Amazon [apparently has separate guidelines](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17328257.htm) (not sure if these are work guidelines) to those of Twitch and they're incompatible and they need to be integrated properly. Several people have stated, in the reviews I've cited, they would much prefer to just have the Amazon CEO run things by himself rather than have 2 separate CEOs with different ideas about what Twitch's future should look like.
* A number of Twitch employees, both current and former, have regretted joining or staying with the company. To illustrate this point here are some the titles of recent glassdoor reviews: (Feel free to read some of these by the way)
 1. [""Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW18011438.htm)

 Yeah, it's not a good time to be hired by Twitch.

* According to one review, Twitch is telling it's [employees in HR to write glassdoor reviews that are positive in an attempt to hide the negative reviews.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17231889.htm) I was skeptical at first about this being true, but then I read the positive reviews and some of them look suspicious. Examples:
 1.  [""Decline to comment""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17362748.htm) This review when read sounds pretty negative, but the review score is still positive somehow. This was likely done as an attempt to appease HR/management. Also, the title says ""Decline to comment"" yet the review is pretty damn descriptive.
 2. [""Travail parfait""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17239924.htm) This review was written in French. No I'm not joking. Curious why Twitch would apparently hire and fly someone to their HQ who can't speak any English. Ironically enough, I suspect this was written by someone who can't speak any French.
 3. [""Great company""](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW15992506.htm) The review reads: ""Pros: Free food great people nice place; Cons: Company long hours but they cool"" That's an actual review someone wrote. Okay, where's the details? What kind of food? What kind of people? Why was the place nice? What kind of hours were you working? You see, they read like reviews that someone wrote not because they wanted to, but because they were told to and didn't want to or were in a rush to write. [There](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW14975239.htm) [are](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW14845841.htm) [several](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW16481936.htm) [like](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17348223.htm) [this.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW16685588.htm) If you do a side by side comparison of the positive and negative reviews you'll notice a severe lack of detail in the positive reviews which likely indicates they're manipulating review scores. Those numbers I gave at the start of this article are much higher than what they should be.

So if you don't think things are going well as a Twitch streamer or viewer you're not alone.

Some other sidenotes: 

* Free food, flexible work schedules, unlimited vacation (with managerial approval), and free massages are offered to all employees which is nice.
* Apparently they pay some employees with Amazon stock
* Emmett apparently not only serves as [the CEO, but also the CTO, CPO, and CIO](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17938881.htm) which might explain why management is so dysfunctional.
* A company email went around where a curseword was used. This makes me think a lot of the reviews that mention this are legit.
* [The Engineering team at Twitch apparently looks more like a gladiator arena than an actual team. \(lots of infighting and politics\)](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17988901.htm)
* [The DevOps and systems teams are apparently skeletal](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17824973.htm)
* Several employees are worried about the lack of promotions and career growth if they choose to stay employed.

TL;DR

Twitch is currently a pair of silos built on a house of playing cards and it's only a matter of time before it collapses unless someone fixes it.

But for viewers like me, it's ALSO annoying because (at least in smaller streams), the backseater gamer is the only one saying much of anything. 

And it's not because there aren't other viewers. There are 10-20 people in these smaller streams, so there are viewers. But if they're anything like me, they end up leaving because of this person who keeps guiding the streamer every step of the way, and they're too nice to tell them to shut the fuck up.

I can't think of any positives to this habit, honestly. For either streamers or viewers, do you enjoy backseat gamers?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7f9byo/does_anyone_like_backseat_gaming/,1511548239.0,112,0.82,101,Twitch,january-

7exvnr,Mobile Streaming: Using your Phone as a Webcam in OBS (from anywhere),"Not many people know you can use your phone as a ""video source"" in OBS. I was talking with a few friends who seem to think the only way to get a high quality mobile stream is to do what some streamers do (no names), and use a giant spaceship backpack stream setup with a nice dSLR camera and 5-10k$+ of equipment. 

Little did everyone know you can do the same thing with the phone you may already have. Thus, I made a quick demo video to show how I do it for my stream (partnered Twitch streamer 4+ years). 

Anyway, let me know how you guys like to mobile stream. I would love to add your feedback into the next video or writeup I do on ""mobile streaming"".

7equdt,Know what I'm thankful for even though it sounds cheesy? Twitch.,"Just had a stream that was my best stream to date and need to share.

I've had a VERY hard time keeping a good schedule lately because my day job keeps changing things around, so streaming has been a very slow climb for me. More often than not I stream to no one (which I don't mind so much because I'm still having fun), but tonight (well, last night technically) I decided to fire up Fortnite BR and potato around after watching DrLupo wreck people for hours.

I got on stream and started doing REALLY well; topped my kill count in a match in the first few rounds. I got one chatter in, which is usually the max I'd get in a stream. He chatted for a while, left, and then I got another one. This dude was from Sweden, apologized profusely for his English, and I just said ""Ah, don't worry about it dude, we can at least try to understand each other--the game makes it easy to figure out what we're referring to!"" He immediately DMed me thanking me profusely for being a nice guy, that he has a developmental disorder so making friends is hard for him, etc. He stayed in chat talking with me for the rest of the stream even though I got tired and got back into my ways of aiming like a potato and we all had fun.

Then a kid from Latvia started chatting too! This is the FIRST time I've ever had to try and keep up with chat because it was moving too fast between those two and it was so much fun! The kid from Latvia asked if we could play duos, so I added him, and we played a few rounds and did pretty well.

Then the guy from Sweden was asking if he could help show me how Nightbot works (I just switched over and was talking about how I wasn't sure why a command was breaking). He's the first person to join my discord and helped me set up a bunch of stuff in Discord and nightbot; he said it makes him feel good to be able to help because he can't work, so he likes helping people with these things. I can't believe someone from the other side of the world took time out of their day to help me with this stuff! I started before midnight and it's now 7am for me and it felt like time absolutely flew by. So rather than write this into a novel, here's why this stream was amazing, and why I'm thankful that Twitch exists so I could have these experiences:

- Watching DrLupo kick ass taught me how to play the game better, and I immediately logged on and did way better than ever before. This has happened before thanks to Twitch with BF1 via XFactor, Stodeh, Ekolimits, etc. If it weren't for Twitch I wouldn't know how to improve in most games I play! Sure I could google, but watching is so much better!
- I get to chat with people from all around the world! I'm from the middle-of-nowhere USA where we were taught to believe that big cities are just all TV make believe, and even though I moved away long enough to know better, that's still the mindset I have sometimes. I live in a super homogenous area that has like no appreciation for any other cultures or anything else and it's SO boring. I've only traveled abroad once, so the fact that I can interact with people from Sweden, Latvia, etc., and play video games with them is fucking amazing!
- Perhaps inconceivable to some, I've NEVER played in duos or squads or anything in any game where you have a solo option before tonight. I've never done voice comms in game because I've been too afraid/anxious to do it. Online gaming is something I'm pretty new to (grew up in the NES/SNES/N64 era, then stopped playing games for a long time unless it was a really good RPG/singleplayer), and the fact that I was finally able to do it and all of my anxiety was for nothing is a great feeling!
- None of my friends IRL play games, really. The one that does doesn't like the same games I do, so I never have anyone to play with even if I wanted to (hence comms and such making me anxious, because it'd have to be with randos unless I make new friends). Therefore, I never have anyone on my friends lists for a lot of the games I want to play. I know it doesn't really matter as long as I'm having fun, but just the fact that someone saw me playing, knowing I wasn't great, but still wanted to add me and play with me anyway is a great feeling.
- This is the second time I've had someone in chat whisper me and tell me that they have a developmental disability of some sort, both times first apologizing if they're ""weird"" and then thanking me for including them. I was watching another streamer play with someone similar and several in his chat were saying good on him for doing that, and he was very outspoken how ""he's a sub, he wants to play with me, and that's all that matters--if you don't like it, go to a cancer chat instead."" It's fucking amazing that Twitch exists for folks like that to be able to connect with other people with the same interests as them and that despite all the negativity you see sometimes there are streamers big and small that are just _good_ people that wanna have GGs.
- It's so awesome to see that as long as you're engaging chat, you don't have to be the most skilled person ever. I was working really hard to narrate and talk more this stream and feel like it really worked!
- In my day job and every day life I spend a lot of time surrounded by salty, negative people. Twitch, both as a viewer and streamer, has made me see how INSANELY better it is to just be positive and have fun, and that's made such an impact on my life.

Anyway, I feel like I could ramble forever (e.g., after having cable my entire life, I cut it off and now watch Twitch all the time--another benefit!), but man...even when I don't want to stream because it feels like, ""what's the point, no one's going to watch"" or I'm just tired from work, this is the kind of shit that makes it worth it. I don't ever give into the cheesy holiday crap for any holiday, but I have to say I'm super thankful for discovering Twitch this last year of my life!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7equdt/know_what_im_thankful_for_even_though_it_sounds/,1511356489.0,147,0.86,19,Twitch,cancerofpassion

7ecxn7,Twitch - Can you please fix your xbox one / xbox one x app? It's depressing.,"I love Twitch.  I watch on my phone, my computer, through apple tv, on my xbox, etc.  In our living room we use an xbox one x (and previously an xbox one) as the general streaming content provider and interface for the TV.  

&amp;nbsp;

The Twitch Xbox one app has always been mediocre, although it didn't used to be anywhere near  this buggy.  Currently I'm happy if I can watch for more than 30 minutes without it crashing or telling me a stream is offline when it isn't or just glitching (audio/video) in and out randomly.  Recently it has started green screening at random as well.  Just now watching a dota match I've had to refresh (close app, quit app, reset app, reload, repeat) 3 times in ~50 minutes and this is a fairly common experience.  I don't believe this is an xbox one x specific bug because I had a similar experience on my xbox one for years. 

&amp;nbsp;

Please help!  We love you and just want to use your product more :)  Also if we could get vods available on xbox one x app at the same time they're available on PC and mobile that would be incredible!  Very frustrating to not be able to watch a decent chunk of content on that platform.

Edit - Wow this thread blew up. Glad I’m not the only one!  Hopefully a member of the twitch team saw this and may consider getting a few people to work on a revamped app?  I believe amazon literally partnered with Microsoft for 4K streaming content on the one x launch, makes perfect sense that one of their subsidiaries should have the best streaming platform possible on the system as well.

With the release of the Twitch site rewrite comes the release of FrankerFaceZ v4, a complete re-write of the extension built from the ground up to be more flexible and powerful than ever.

7dihaf,"5 TIPS FOR ANY STREAMER - Posted this elsewhere, thought it might help a few people.","I posted this on a Facebook twitch streamer group and got advised to post it here too... anyways

5 TIPS FOR ANY STREAMER

If you want to take this (semi) seriously, here's a few tips from a guy that has streamed for many years, struggling, having (relative) success, being consistent, being lazy, having few viewers, and lots. I've done it all, and trial and error has taught me the following (this is long, but worth a read)

.....................

1 - Care about how your stream looks

First thing any potential viewer will see is how your stream looks. Have decent (as good as you can) video quality

Make sure your overlay isn't too jarring and covering too much, seriously, no overlay is better than a bad one.

Be selective in the information you want to display, newest follower? cool, last tip? yeah, but people don't want to see a million bits of text all over the screen. I get you want to thank your supporters, but the main point of the stream is the gameplay, and YOU! If a person is just watching your channel to see their name on your overlay, that's not the kind of viewer you want anyway.

Webcam is almost vital, have a decent cam with at least decent lighting. Unless you have a fantastic voice and are very confident in talking to yourself, you need something to focus your viewers attentions, a webcam helps with this. Also, if you use a green screen, make sure it looks good. A crappy looking green screen, looks worse than no green screen. trust me.

2 - Have good audio, and talk

Second thing, that will make anyone switch off your stream is having bad audio.. I check out a LOT of smaller streamers, and this is the biggest thing that will make me switch off within a few minutes. No matter how good your gameplay is or how good your stream looks.

It doesn't have to spend a lot of money, a lot of headsets have a half decent mic on there, the best way is a standalone mic, again, you can pick up a half decent usb mic for £30. The main thing is, put a little research into how to record good audio!
Listen back to a vod, or record a test though OBS. If your mic is clipping or sounding distorted, fix it. Make sure your game audio is there, but make sure you can be heard over the top of it. Use a noise gate and/or noise reduction (built into obs) to not have fan whirr and horrible noise though your mic.

It might take a few hours to get things set up, but honestly, its worth it!

3 - Play a game you enjoy, on a schedule

The big one, if you want to do this for a while, you NEED to enjoy what you're doing. Play a game you would play if you weren't streaming, don't play a game you THINK will get you views, or do it tactically. I played lots of games, trying to find my 'niche', but when i actually started playing the game i would boot up pre/post stream, is when i started getting better viewership. The fact i enjoy the game, and know a bit about it is what did it. It might not work for you, but its what worked for me and its at least worth trying!

Also, if you have a small viewerbase, i wouldnt try to be a 'variety' streamer, or at least schedule your most popular game, and fit the other games around it. When youre building a viewerbase, you want to stream what the regulars want to see, when they are expecting to see it. A schedule is important, even if you stream 6 days a week, make sure youre streaming the same game, at the same time for a fiew hours, at the same time for at least 3 days.

4 - Watch the numbers, but don't get bogged down by it

Controversial, but watch your current viewer numbers live, and compare views/unique views/follows per day using the twitch stats in your dashboard. BUT DON'T GET OBSESSED.

I see a lot of people say ""dont care about number, just do what you do"" and whilst this is the right attitude to have, i.e. don't get upset or angry when you have less viewers, and don't get giddy when you get a few more than usual, but use this information to your advantage. See what times youre getting the most views, what games are bringing in the most viewers, if you are keeping more viewers around that usual, what are you doing, if you had a load of people leave, why did that happen?
Don't get obsessed by it, its easy to get drawn into it (been there, done that), but its vitak info.

5 - Network and use Social Media

People get the wrong idea with what is meant by networking.
NETWORKING IS NOT SPAMMING LINKS ON PAGES AND FORUMS!
Get involved with the community of the game you play,participate in forum posts, get on reddit and be a part of the scene, watch other streamers and be a part of the chat, chat with other streamers that play the same game, maybe make a community around it.

But please, don't spam your twitch there, that INSTANTLY turns people off you.
I'll be honest, this part is a ""do as i say not as i do"" part, because I struggle to have the time to network as well as i want to.

6 (extra) - BE PATIENT! Dont kill yourself!

Take your time, I don't mean days, I don't mean, weeks, it could be months, years, until you get to the point you want to. The bottom line is, you gotta want to do this, enjoy it, and love it.

There are stories of people getting a few hundred viewers in their first few streams and being partnered in a very short period of time. These are generally people who have already built a network in a gaming community and/or are moving over from youtube.

There are people that make affiliate in a few weeks, and congratulations.

DON'T JUDGE YOURSELF AGAINST OTHERS!

I have been streaming off and on for YEARS, almost 4 years at time of writing.
Over that time i have learned to do the points listed above, figured it out myself through hard work, and being stupid.

Fortunately for me, due to the fact i had built a bit of a community when the Affiliate program launched, i was automatically eligible for that, but that was only due to the fact i had spent years doing the above. I am now eligible for partnership, but i want to re-iterate, that is because i have been continuing to build my community since then!

It may take a year to get affiliate, it may take years to get partnered. It could happen in a couple of months, or it could not happen at all. My main point stands, do it because you enjoy it, and don't get discouraged if you don't hit goals when you hope/expect.

Finally, dont kill yourself. If you work 40 hours a week, dont stream 40 hours a week... you WILL make yourself ill. Again, speaking from experience.

Stream in the time you have free. If you are able to stream more, do it, it may help your exposure, it may not. Its better to stream 3 times a week for 3 hours at a time in a good, healthy, mental state, thank it is 5 times a week for 6 hours whilst being exhausted and strung out. TRUST ME, again, speaking from experience.

.....................

Total essay of a post, but they are all lessons i have learned myself over a long time, and are certainly worth reading over.

PLEASE, post your own experiences and advice below, this is what this community is supposed to be for.

Agree with what i said, or have i opened your eyes? Let me know. Disagree with it? Why? I want to hear your point of view.

End of the day, have fun, stay healty, and enjoy streaming!

7d8i51,Can we talk about the state of Creative?,"Creative is in a bad state. There have been many changes made to Creative, and most of them have impeded the growth of this wonderful section. Creative casters and community members are intensely dedicated to Creative, but the withdrawal of support has left us all feeling hung out to dry. I want this to spark a discussion about the future of Creative on Twitch, and I want Twitch to level with us on the support they are willing to provide.

 

An incomplete list of the changes that have affected Creative:

* **Cross-listing to Creative using Communities such as Food/Music – Removed.** As casters looked for ways to bring Creative to other parts of Twitch, they began to branch out to different ""game"" categories beyond Creative. Most common would be setting the game to IRL, then choosing a creative community such as music. This would show the caster in both IRL and Creative, expanding their reach. With the recent ""beta"" update this has been removed.

* **Creative directory landing page Jumbotron – Removed.** This was a video player directly on the Creative game directory page that would show a current creative streamer. It was extremely noticeable when a caster was on the Jumbotron because the huge increase in viewers. Twitch slowly did less and less curation, allowing vodcasts to be shown, and the Jumbotron has now been removed.

* **Bob Ross/Food channels – No longer streaming in Creative.** The channels used to launch Creative no longer stream in that category and provide a boost in viewership. They now stream in Always On. This along with the removal of cross-listing means these channels no longer show in Creative. Let me re-iterate: the very channels used to launch the Creative category don't even stream in Creative.

* **Commission button – Removed.** There was a button next to the sub button that allowed someone to contact the caster about commissioning a piece. The caster could show or hide this button. This has been removed with the change to the ""beta"" site. I know this feature wasn't very fleshed out, but I used it as a quick glance to see if commissions were open or not.

* **Hashtags/communities – difficult to utilize.** Creative has had a rough time with the changes to communities. Hashtags were initially implemented with creative, and were outright removed with the launch of communities. I personally don't use communities for discovery, but I had used hashtags when they were available. Communities are no longer shown on the Creative game directory. I did find a page that shows creative-associated communities, but 500 bits to anyone who can 1) find that page and 2) explain to me how that is intuitive UX design.

 

I don't want this to be all negative, but the paths forward I have come up with require serious buy-in from Twitch to accomplish. I know there are people at the Company who care deeply for Creative and I love them for it, but it's becoming harder to believe the Company cares about Creative. This isn't the first time we've made noise about how the changes are hurting us. These are the questions I hope to address: **Do you (the reader) even care about Creative as a category or do you view Twitch as a gaming-only platform? Do you think Twitch is willing and able to go beyond gaming? What would it take to foster a healthy and growing Creative section, from Twitch, the casters, and the viewers? Is there a future for Creative on Twitch?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7d8i51/can_we_talk_about_the_state_of_creative/,1510791401.0,82,0.94,33,Twitch,Tchaikovsky1812
7d87ah,How does Twitch deal with SELF HARM and SUICIDE? Shamefully...,"CW: The following post contains content about suicide attempts and self harm.

EDIT: TL;DR the post and comments:
The suggestions are for Twitch to re-examine it policies and ToS; have people with a background in health to advise them (not turn it into a mental health service replacement); re-examine it's bot functions that may harm people at risk; and include features that the community can alert to help people who are at risk of self harm and suicide, and not ban them.

Hello,

I am a moderator of an Australian streamer's Twitch channel.  I am also a health professional, and hold a mental health first aid certificate. Last night, Viewer made some statements in chat that he was having a rough day and he ""might as well do an IRL stream and shoot himself in the head"" or ""hang himself"". Chat sent him well wishes, the streamer was also concerned and I jumped into whisper with Viewer.

After only moments of conversation with Viewer, it was evident that he was seriously suicidal and had self harmed within the past two days. I stayed with him on chat, and found out he lives on the other side of the world to me and no-one to contact urgently where he was. He was alone, and he was desperate and in danger. I used the ""Report: Self Harm"" function, an noted this person needed urgent medical attention. I continued to stay with him in whisper and the situation was beginning to improve. Within 5 minutes, there was a response from Twitch, but not what I was expecting...

Twitch banned his account.

I managed to make contact with Viewer via Instagram, and continued to improve his state over the next hour, made a plan to make contact again and for him to link back in with his health professional.

I am absolutely infuriated at the (lack of) response and heavy handed approach Twitch has taken. If there was a person sitting on the other end of my Report function, I am dismayed and disgusted that they would sit there and ban a user when someone has requested urgent medical attention.

If it this is a bot-ban hammer, I am even more disgusted that Twitch would use an automated feature to deal with vulnerable people who are at immediate risk of ending their lives. To use an automated feature is even more unacceptable and deplorable.

I have used their Help function and Twitter with no response in over 12 hours. Absolutely shameful; this is bigger than trolls, we are talking about the biggest killers of youth today. Self harm can be an indicator of suicide, and when somebody states they are thinking about suicide it is important to help them. Not silence them.

Other big websites like Facebook have tools to step in and help after a Self Harm report has been made, and I am so angry that Twitch's response is to put self harm and suicide in the too hard basket and ban users instead.

Step up your game Twitch, and I am not going to shut the fuck up about this until something reasonable has been done to change this in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7d87ah/how_does_twitch_deal_with_self_harm_and_suicide/,1510788595.0,1592,0.88,248,Twitch,badxan

7cykwq,Well I guess it's time to say goodbye to BTTV and the legacy site (at least for now),"In the last couple hours, twitch has completely removed the option for the Legacy site.

http://prntscr.com/hahtao

 We can no longer use the older and admittedly more clunky site **at all.** There is barely any BTTV support for the new site (support still in very early rewrite development). 

I know Twitch has no obligations to provide us with a site that is BTTV supported and are not affiliated with BTTV, but it would be really awesome if we still had the option to bring back the Legacy site, **at least** until BTTV is fixed for the new site.

Edit: For all those wondering what my personal issues are, I took a screenshot comparing the old BTTV supported chat (left side) next to the new, forced chat (right side): http://prntscr.com/haj1rx

Edit 2: It seems there is a little confusion over what this post is about. It is not about fixing BTTV. It is not about fixing FFZ. It is not about comparing BTTV with FFZ and any other extension. Most importantly, it is certainly not about bashing the new twitch site. Most of us have been having a productive conversation about the current state of the new twitch chat/UI and how being forced out of legacy affects us.

I'm glad to announce an AMA with the lead developer of FrankerFaceZ (FFZ) /u/SirStendec   
  
  
&gt; Hey, I'm Mike aka SirStendec, and I'm the lead developer of the FrankerFaceZ browser extension. I'm a speedrunner and I found Twitch in September, 2013. I found FrankerFaceZ in January, 2014 and subsequently took over its development two weeks later.  
  
&gt; FrankerFaceZ is an enhancement suite for Twitch that adds custom, channel-specific emotes on top of numerous optional tweaks to chat and other parts of the website to let people dial in their optimal experience. FrankerFaceZ is also known for having a ton of features that make life easier for chat moderators.  
  
&gt; With the release of the Twitch site rewrite comes the release of FrankerFaceZ v4, a complete re-write of the extension built from the ground up to be more flexible and powerful than ever. The features aren't all in yet, but they're coming.  
  
###The AMA will be held [Friday November 17th at 4pm EST](http://a.chronus.eu/180414C)

From the email

&gt;Twitch is releasing the nearly 30 million inactive usernames that were associated with the Twitch predecessor, Justin.tv.

&gt;This is confidential information which you are receiving because you are a Partner. Please read through all of the details of this email and do not share it until you see official communication from Twitch on the blog or Twitter.

&gt;After we launched the ability to change usernames, the logical next question was, “When are you going to release JTV usernames?” We’re excited to say that for PARTNERS ONLY, that day is today and that time is now.

&gt;We’re releasing the nearly 30 million inactive usernames that were associated with the Twitch predecessor, Justin.tv. These highly coveted names have been unavailable since we retired the Justin.tv brand a few years ago, but we’re excited to finally make them available again. Because we understand how important it is to your personal brand, and acknowledge the additional complexities involved in changing a Partner username, we would like to extend you the opportunity to claim these names, starting today, before the public launch later next week.

&gt;As a Partner, you have been given access to these names as of right now. All you will need to do is change your name through the standard flow on your settings page. For instructions on how to complete this, see here. If you’ve already changed your username in the past 60 days, fear not as we’ve also overridden that cooldown for you.

&gt;As a Partner, it’s important to us that you have all the information you need when it comes to changing your username. As such, we would like to remind you of the below key facts and known issues that may impact your account if you change your username:

&gt;1. Your revenue will not be impacted. We want to stress that a username change will lead to absolutely no loss of revenue.
&gt; 2. Your old username will not be recycled. Except in special circumstances, your username will not be made available again to anyone else.
&gt; 3. If you change your username, you will lose access to your broadcaster stats associated with your old username. If you want to preserve your prior broadcast stats, you must export your stats prior to the name change.
&gt; 4. Your channel URL will not redirect to your new username. You will need to update the URL anywhere you are using it — your business card, Twitter or Facebook profile, etc.

&gt;We’re as excited about this as you are, but please do not share this information publicly until you see an official communication from Twitch on the blog or Twitter.

This feature NEEDS to be added to the Twitch app.  Twitch VODs in general are often many hours in length, with a lot of down time of the streamer waiting for game queues, going to the bathroom, mindless banter, muted audio due to licensing issues, etc.  But it's basically impossible to seek forward 3-5 minutes manually.  Because the play time is so long, you basically have to move the time icon forward one pixel with your thumb and you end up going forward 30+ min or something

7bjkrb,Dedicated regulars mean everything to us,"Hey Twitchers,

I just wanted to share a great feeling with you all that will hopefully remind some people out there what this streaming thing is all about. I hear a lot of streamers talk as if viewer count is everything, which gave me even more reason to share my recent experiences:

Just to give you a background, I started streaming about 1.5 months ago. I was a competitive Gwent player with a pretty high ranking (top 100 on global leaderboards at one point) so I was able to build a small following relatively quickly by exclusively streaming Gwent and TES: Legends. I got affiliated after a month, which made me so hyped, but once I decided to go in to streaming with more of a variety, I noticed barely any of my followers coming back. I still have my regulars who show up at least once a week, which I am extremely greatful for, but the majority of my followers would show up and say ""oh, no Gwent?"" and then just leave right away...

Recently I was streaming The Long Dark, which is a nice single player survival game, and some dude from Australia came to hang out with me while he was sick in bed at like 3:00am and couldnt sleep. He stayed up with me for the whole stream, and now whenever I fire up my stream, he is there to greet me literally as soon as I go live, and we can just chat about whatever. He will stay up until 4 in the morning just to chill. It's the most amazing feeling to know that someone is coming to watch my stream because he enjoys me and the atmoshpere which I have created on my channel, even when it's just a few of us a lot of the time, I know that everyone there is having a great time just chilling and talking bollocks.

Why do I share this story? Because this is what it's all about. This made me realise that I want people to come and watch my stream because of me and the community I am striving to create, not just the game I play. I honestly feel way better having only 5 viewers per session who are highly active and having a good time than 50 viewers who I know will bail as soon as I change games. Forming connections is what it's all about, and I look forward to forming many more with streaming as a medium &lt;3

7bcm9m,Changing Spotify levels just for the streamer.,"**Who I am -** I am a PubG streamer and my audience likes to have music but I need to listen for footsteps and gun shots. I wanted a simple solution to my problem of having to play them music at a audible level and me wanting to listen intently to my game. Everyone was telling me this was a mixer issue and I would have to spend upwards of 100 dollars to fix it. I set out to find a simplier solution that was free.

**The Goal** - Spotify at one level for me and another for the Viewer (All other sounds Equal)

What you need to install (Voice Meter Banana, Audio Router, An Audio Cable)

**How To.**

 1. Install [Voice Meter Banana](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) and [Audio Router](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router/releases/tag/v0.10.2)

 1. Open Voice Meter Banana
[Change the Hardware Input 1 to your Virtual Audio Cable \(Check A1\)](https://imgur.com/ucEEj7b)

[Also For Hardware Out \(TOP LEFT\) Make A1 = YOUR HEADSET](https://imgur.com/LLFqLPI)

[Use Voicemeeter Aux Input as default device.](https://imgur.com/u9OBuxq)

1. Open Audio Router
1. Open Spotify
1. [Click the drop down](https://imgur.com/3P0NXG2) for spotify and [route to Cable-A](https://imgur.com/TX83nmS)

Open up OBS go to 
File
Settings
Audio
Desktop Audio Device (DEFAULT)
Desktop Audio Device 2 (Cable-A)

This should accomplish Your stream having ALL the same level of audio except for spotify.
You can use Hardware Input 1 to adjust the spotify volume on your end without disrupting the stream audio.

7b7292,Another way to do donations - what do you think?,"Lurker here posting for the first time. I had an idea for another way to do donations and I'm curious what you all think. 

The idea is to set up stream challenges where people donate to a common pool that is only paid out if the challenge is completed by the streamer. Examples could be a speedrunner getting a new PR or getting a chicken dinner in PUBG. If they don't accomplish the goal, the payout doesn't happen. It would be similar to how kickstarter works but with different conditions for when the money is actually paid (and a much shorter timeframe).

I thought of this idea while watching streamers get donation trains and seeing messages like, ""if you win this game, I'll donate $50"". I realize that some of those might be bogus, but I'm guessing there are many people out there that like the feel of watching someone getting closer to goal while the stakes get higher and higher. I think this would entice some people to donate that wouldn't otherwise donate.

I'm a software developer so I'd be able to set it up where the pot amount shows up on the stream. Perhaps streamers could personalize it so an amount will only show up on stream if the pot gets above a certain quantity or some notification plays whenever someone contributes to the pot.

Anyways, would streamers appreciate something like this?

Edit: Looks like GatherBot is doing something like this on an individual basis. Maybe the idea of everyone pitching in together is enough to warrant a different implementation. I dunno.

7a4gqn,Double Purchase of Bits Due to System Error. Twitch Support Refuses to Help.,"TL;DR

So before I start I wish to apologize for I am not English but I try my best.

About 5 weeks ago I made a 25000 bit purchase to support a streamer but due to some technical issue the transaction went through twice. Now instead of paying €320,14 ($372.641) i lost €640,28 ($745.31). I got 50000 bits but this was unwanted. My brother shares his Visa card with me and this transaction now took a heavy toll on the both of us because he happened to get some bills he needs to pay as well. I can understand that technical issues happen and are not anyone's fault. But I am here to complain about the support twitch has given me on this issue. 

&amp;nbsp;

According to my bank I should first reach out to the support to handle this issue before disputing it. And I have tried my best to work with these guys but without any result except frustration. I will explain everything I went through to get where I am now:

The streamer I donated to decided to help me with this, she contacted twitch through twitter where they told her I'd best make a ticket on twitch for this. I did as told, made a ticket and waited 8 days before making another ticket. I got a reply after roughly 2 weeks. The reply said:

&amp;nbsp;

""Hello,

Our sincerest apologies for the delay in response, our team has been quite active lately helping the community with all the exciting updates to the site.

For any assistance regarding Bits charges please direct your inquiries to Amazon directly. You may use this page to locate all the contact info for Amazon.

Thanks!""


&amp;nbsp;

So we went to Amazon to get this mistake fixed. But unlike twitch Amazon actually replied within 20 hours. Outstanding support if I do say so myself, but the reply was not what I expected:

&amp;nbsp;

""Hello,

I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused.

I understand you want a refund for Twitch Bits order that was accidentally purchased.

Although Twitch Interactive is part of the Amazon family, it is independently operated. Please contact Twitch Interactive directly at purchasesupport@twitch.tv for help with refund for the Twitch Bits order.

We look forward to seeing you again soon.""

&amp;nbsp;

So Amazon tells me this is Twitch's domain. That only leaves me to wonder why they would redirect me to Amazon. Bad support? Incompetence? Refusing to give the money back? I can only guess. Anyway, i was very frustrated at this point and  I send a mail to twitch on the given email to get this over with.
9 days later I get a reply back saying:

&amp;nbsp;

""Thanks for contacting Twitch support.
Our sincerest apologies for the delay in response, our team has been quite active lately helping the community with all the exciting updates to the site.
In the chance that your issue has resolved itself since contacting us, then that is great news! If not, and you would still like some assistance, please reply back to this and a representative will contact you shortly.""

Note the part ""The chance that your issue has resolved itself"".
I do not see how this issue can resolve itself... instead of someone actually looking into this matter they just send me one of these standard pre-written email without a second thought about this matter.
At this point i was VERY frustrated and I've written a pretty angry mail back and telling them that maybe I'll have to go public with this issue. After that mail I got a mail back the same day. I was literally thrilled and excited by this. The reply I got was:

&amp;nbsp;

""Of course, so sorry about this! Our apologies at this time.
Please provide me with the Order numbers from your email receipts for both of the related payments so that I may issue this for you.
Thanks.""

&amp;nbsp;

This was progress for me. I was happy. Until 7 days later where I still had no reply of any kind. No feedback or nothing.
At this point the Visa got cleared so we knew the Visa was going to charge the bank soon. We have near nothing left at this point and I send my last mail to twitch 2 days ago. I explained them that I'm going further with this, i'm going public and I'm going to my bank again for a dispute.  And i do not care how far I will have to push this. This kind of support is unacceptable for a company as large as twitch.

What does it take for twitch to cooperate with me? how much more time and effort will I have to put into this? Is twitch refusing to refund? this amount is NOTHING to them but LIFE CHANGING to us at this current time. Maybe they aren't refusing, maybe their employees lack the capability of doing their job properly. Or maybe they have to put their entire staff on these so called ""exciting updates to the site"" so that they cannot help me.

&amp;nbsp;

I do not know what twitch's issue is with helping me with my issue.. but it has frustrated me.. very much and I just want it to stop. I have unsubbed to all the streamers i was subbed to, I stopped purchasing bits. I WILL NOT support twitch before this issue is fixed. 

I'm running out of options here and if the issue isn't resolved with Twitch directly I'll be forced to go to my bank and dispute the double purchase. I'm open to hearing any advice or solution anyone can offer for me regarding my issue.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
-------------------------------------------------------
EDIT:

&amp;nbsp;

So i got a reply here from nerolabs. Many thanks!
My case got noticed and something is being done about it, hopefully this will will avoid further complications for other people in the future.

I got confirmation via email:

&amp;nbsp;

""So sorry about this!
In an effort to rectify this situation with you, our valued user, we have refunded $616.00 ($308 × 2) back to you, please allow up to 2-3 business days for this to post to your account.
Please do not hesitate to reach out should you experience any troubles. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
Have a GREAT day and please ENJOY the streams \(^o^)/
Kindest Regards,
Twitch Support""

&amp;nbsp;

Aside from this email I got confirmation from Amazon as well that both transactions have been refunded.
This is going to help us out a lot, many thanks.
Despite the long wait, twitch support did seem willing to resolve this issue. I do not know where this went wrong or what happened exactly, but hopefully this will avoid other people from running in the same issue and hopefully twitch support will pay more attention.

To me this seems like a good sign that I can trust twitch and that they are willing to help people with their issues.
It was also nice to see there's so many understanding people and people willing to give me options for the worst case scenario's. Thank you everyone who contributed!

I will update this post once more after we receive the refunded amount back in a few days.

784qme,19 months of streaming: my story so far.,"I'm ripping this from a comment I left another streamer (slightly edited to make sense), decided to post it as its own post and hopefully it helps someone.

I've been streaming for 19 months now. I sat streaming LoL for the first 4 months to absolutely no one, so when I got that first real regular, it was divine. Then the second, then the third and fourth, pretty soon I was getting 6-7 viewers every single stream, after about 7 months. Then I found a game coming out of beta, and decided to start streaming it, first on the final beta weekend, then starting on the release date.
Within 2-3 days on that game I shot up to 30 viewers, minimum, every stream. most days I had 50+ in there, I was in heaven. Chat was insane, I was pumped, elated, I'd caught my lucky break, life was good on the top. I made a ton of friends, got to know a ton of new viewers, the game devs, it was just awe inspiring to suddenly be the guy everyone wanted to watch. I felt so good every day, every stream, I went out there and put on my best face, life was good.

Then the game died. within two months the entire game channel went from 200+ viewers to about 20. All these people I'd gotten to know left. All except about 2 people, and I was back down to 8-10 viewers. I straight up gave up on streaming mentally.

I stopped streaming 8 hours a day 6 days a week. I'd miss days of streaming, my schedule flip flopped around. I my energy and motivation fell through the floor, everything I'd built had collapsed. No more pm's from devs, no more massive raids to drop, no more insane hype in chat, just dead mostly.
I appreciated those who'd stuck with me. They were no longer viewers to me, they were twitch friends. Not the kind of friends you call when you're sad, or go get beers with on the weekend, but those very few people, they were my one rock remaining in the barren wastelands of my mind, that gave me hope to continue on.

Then they stopped coming mostly.

Sure, they'd pop in from time to time, say hi, or lurk, and leave. As my viewership numbers tanked even further, I would think to myself ""why even bother streaming today. no one will be there."" But I have very little else going for myself in life. I had nothing but time on my hands, so I'd still stream occasionally. Mentally though, I'd checked out. I stopped caring. The tides of twitch had broken me, and I didn't give a damn anymore.

This is where the turn began.

 Despite not streaming as often, I'd remind myself of the times when I streamed to absolutely no one. I struggled to comprehend even WHY it was so soul crushing losing everyone, considering at one point I had no one at all. Not even friends who'd come watch. I couldn't figure out what I'd done wrong, why I'd been shunned by literal dozens of people. Was it something I said? Was I not funny enough? Did I piss off the wrong viewer and they convinced others to leave? Even the closest twitch ""friends"" had all but evaporated. My discord server was filled with spam from two people, despite having over 100 members, talking about league of legends and shit posting back and forth and spamming about spamming (no joke).

I never did get an answer, but my attitude hardened. I realized through all this time I was still doing this mindless task of streaming, still turning the stream on at least 2-3 days a week, and still breathing. Once I stopped giving a damn about viewers, I began to appreciate those few, very very few, people whos faces I still saw. I saw new faces come in, watch for a bit, and leave. I've seen this thousands of times. THOUSANDS. each time someone comes in, talks for a stream, or a few streams, and you think you're building a connection with them then they disappear it tears you up some.

But over TIME, lots of time, hundreds of streams, I noticed a trend. No matter how rarely these people came around, they still DID come around. I developed an entirely new appreciation for the people who come into my stream. My attitude changed. I was no longer just appreciative, I was genuinely thankful, in a way I'd never been before. Each and every human who comes into my chat, I'm not just happy to have another viewer, I don't appreciate them for being a number, I treat em just like I would if it were a stranger at a bar in real life. Strike up a conversation. Introduce yourself. Find out what they like to do, find common ground, like you would when making a friend. I no longer had anything to lose, and lost interest in growing my stream, it was hopeless at this point. This was around June this year.

Fast forward to today, I haven't had less than 18 viewers a stream in two weeks. Wednesday this week I averaged 38. I honestly, could not care less. Legitimately. Not saying it for the camera, not saying it to sound cool on Reddit, I legitimately could not give a damn if there are 5 or 50 people in chat. I don't care if my viewers don't show up for weeks. I don't care if they show up every day. I have nothing to lose. Nothing. There's nothing I could lose that I haven't lost before.

These hardships, they forge you. They force you to dig deep if you want to continue. We all deal with trauma in different ways, and having everything you love torn to the ground, kicked, spit on, abandoned, and rendered irrelevant, obsolete, and forgotten, it either breaks you or it makes you stronger. I came out stronger I suppose. I definitely came out less weak as a human. I no longer try to put on a show for stream. I used to call it that, it was my 'show'. Ha. shows are for actors, and unless you're the next great actor, no one is gonna buy it. It was a personality shift in myself, that shifted my attitude towards what my stream is, and it could only have happened through repeated breaking of everything I held to be true.

So story aside, some of my advice. Treat every single stream as your first stream. Today you're gonna have 0 viewers. Accept it. you don't have viewers. That means you got more time to talk to anyone who comes in. Remember that there is a split between game-play and streamer that creates the formula of what makes a good stream. It cannot be 100% game-play, with no streamer interaction and hope to grow. It can be 100% streamer though. That just reinforces that original statement, you are literally part, or all, of what people come to watch. If people wanted to watch other people be fake, they'd be watching cable instead of Twitch.tv, so know that this process you're in will be a defining factor in who you turn out to be as an entertainer.

Don't worry either, I promise you anything you build up will again be torn down. I'm sure mine will fall apart and I'll go back to streaming to 5-6 people at some point. This would probably be disheartening if I cared anymore. Since I'm just being me, playing video games, talking real talk to my computer, it no longer matters if I have a chat or not, I don't need that crutch anymore. I've been without. Its not as fun, and its not easy, but it is something everyone goes through, and likely multiple times, especially nowadays.

I've dropped a lot of hard and fast statements here that I'm sure people can argue into the ground. ""but so and so didn't ever fall off!"" ok? sure? there are a hundred explanations for those cases, and in the end this is an excuse that others can debate over, I don't care. I am just a streamer, I stream, its what I do and who I am now. Don't care what others do or did or didn't do. Don't care that its a saturated market, don't care that I'm not seeing success as fast as others, I just don't care anymore. and it's working pretty well so far I guess.

I don't know if my story will help you. I didn't list every single time the viewership dropped, or rose. But I can tell you, it happened to me, and it does seem to be cyclic, and that there is always a surge after the calm. You meet new people. You make new friends. Then you have a whole new set of friends who move on, or come irregularly. But then you get to a point where, like me, I have 100+ unique chatters over a 18 average viewer stream, and you realize that if you pick up enough people who love your stuff, even if they aren't all there at once, you can maintain solid viewership numbers and always have someone to talk to, even if its not the same person every day or every hour of a stream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/784qme/19_months_of_streaming_my_story_so_far/,1508725017.0,287,0.86,80,Twitch,cconeus

77yfjm,Twitch Culture as a whole... and being an older streamer.,"I have a love/hate relationship with Twitch. On the one hand, I think it's a great platform for creatives to come together as a community, and everyone shares and participates in something they love.

On the other hand, I find most of Twitch to be vile. Especially the attitudes I see towards older gamers, or people who try to take it more seriously and present content that's mature. I see the trolling in those chats constantly, the same low-brow easy jokes being made day in and day out. I know trolling is just a given anywhere you go online, but I have to say it's just kind of discouraging and disgusting to watch at times. 

I notice that the people who do the best on Twitch seem to be the younger, louder, more obnoxious streamers, and I've noticed some of the older streamers that I really love to watch start to act that way too in order to get viewers. Or, they act like PewDiePie, who... don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the guy personally and he seems like an OK person, but I'd be lying if I didn't say he was obnoxious. 

I'm not saying it needs to be super serious all the time or anything like that. It doesn't need to be monocles and swirling glasses all the time, but the bouncing off the walls shitposting is just becoming super grating the more I'm on Twitch. 

It makes me wonder in what direction the site is going, and if it's time to abandon it before it completely loses its shit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/77yfjm/twitch_culture_as_a_whole_and_being_an_older/,1508648818.0,54,0.73,75,Twitch,[deleted]

We are all excited for TwitchCon. It is a convention were we get to see our favorite streamers, get awesome advice, listen in on panels with in depth subjects, and have a good overall time celebrating the site that made streaming entertainment possible.

My message to streamers. Do what we do. The fans are there for us. The smaller streamers are there for us. Talk to as many of the people that support you as humanly possible. Without them we are nothing in this industry, Obviously there is no need to roll up in an entourage of subs and donators everywhere you go, but definitely give them a few minutes to say hi, ask a question or two and make them smile. Cause that's what we do. We bring smiles to these fans faces on daily basis. When someone is having a shitty day, we are there. When someone has passed away in their family, we are there, when someone is going through heartbreak, we are there. 

Smaller streamers just starting out. They sometimes to look up to a lot of us. Give advice where you can. And it wouldn't hurt to attend a panel or two and show support for your fellow streamers, as we are not perfect and have a lot to learn.

My message to the fans. We love you. We want to see you smile around us. At the same time give your favorite streamer a little breathing room. I'm not trying to be a dick by saying that. WE KNOW and acknowledge your support by merely being there. 

Don't be shy. Be excited at TwitchCon. Come up to your favorite streamer and say hi. We love that shit. (we have egos too) We love to talk to you guys about what we're doing next, what we been doing, and memorable moments in our streams. When at the meet &amp; greet line, first off THANK YOU in advance for being there for us streamers. At the same time know there are hundreds of people behind you waiting to say hi to their favorite streamers too.

Hammers up fam we all love you

Message to all after hours. Be responsible. UBER &amp; Lift EVERYWHERE. Don't walk alone. Walk with someone always. Pace yourself. The night is long. There is a reason TwitchCon starts 11am/12pm. Cause Twitch knows we are out late partying. Don't do anything extremely stupid. Obviously have fun. Have YOUR FUN. 

For IRL streamers. I watch a lot here and there. But please respect privacy of others. If someone wishes to not be recorded. Have the decency to respect that. Not everyone wants to be put out there and have their conversations heard.

774jeb,For anyone who’s turned off from streaming.,"Be yourself, play the games you really enjoy. Don’t worry about what anybody is thinking of you or if you should talk more, or if you’re annoying. Just BE and do what you enjoy and if somebody happens to click on your stream, that’s a person to have a conversation with. You’re not acting, you’re enjoying. You’ll get nice people and you’ll have a douche nozzles every now and then but they’re two clicks away from being timed out or banned and shut out. Don’t let it bother you if no ones watching. You’re playing the game because you want to, and why not stream it and have the opportunity to meet some people? 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression. Millions have. It’s an every day struggle ,saying the right thing and doing the things that make you look as smart as you know you are. People can be terrible, ignorant, and self absorbed thinking they’re better than the next guy. But in all reality nobody’s better than anyone. Anybody could learn the things you know just as well and if not better. Then, you can learn those things more in depth and better than them. We’re all the same. Say somebody says something that you don’t agree with. You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk to them anymore. There’s nothing wrong with anything you do unless you physically hurt someone. Or mentally fuck with a person.

JTV names have also still not been released. Maybe Twitch partners have access to these names, I do not know because I am not one. I have met several people now who said they want to start broadcasting once the username they want is made available. Supposedly, the inactive usernames have been reclaimed by Twitch and not released to the public. This was posted by someone here 4 months ago, but I don't see a reason why they still have to be held or why Twitch has been pretty much silent on this.

76stu5,8 OBS tips to make your stream run smoothly,"Hi  /r/Twitch! 

We recently published in the StreamElements blog a guide to help streamers make their stream run smoother. 

We asked approval from the mods of /r/Twitch to post a summary of the post, with a link to the full post, that includes more details on each tip. 
Read the full post: [8 OBS tips to make your stream run smoothly](https://blog.streamelements.com/8-obs-tips-to-make-your-stream-run-smoothly-a8d634b34bce)

Here are the bullet points:

- Use your Graphics Card for Encoding - Use the NVENC/VCE/QSV setting in OBS to change encoding from CPU to your graphics card and releasing some workload.

- Adjust video bitrate - Bitrate is affected by your internet upload. By reducing it in 100 at a time you will notice the reduction in your CPU usage. 

- Advanced Encoder Settings - There’s a few hidden settings within the output settings section. One of them, encoder preset can control how much you upload, the higher the prest = less CPU. 

- Potentially countering drop in quality from using NVENC/VCE/QSV -  This cool trick counters the drop in quality

- Downscaling your resolution - In video settings section in your OBS you can downscale your resolution output, which means your computer will need to encode less, and therefore will lower CPU usage. 

- Load your overlay from a single browser source - by using StreamElements, you can load your whole overlay from one browser source instead of several, reducing your CPU usage by a lot. 

- Selecting a downscale filter - This option controls how to downscale your resolution. By choosing the Bilinear option you’re choosing the best option for less powerful computers. 

- Selecting an FPS to stream at - FPS settings are affecting directly your CPU usage, the less frames (30) the less work for your CPU.  

We hope you’ll find it useful!

76amtf,To all the small streamers out there [x-post r/pubattlegrounds],"
&gt;I stream PUBG and there's a little kid and his sister that sit for hours watching me, they're my only viewers and I talk to them for hours and hours whenever I get to play. His dad left them and they often talk to me and say how much they wish his dad was as cool as me. Sometimes they send me emails and stuff asking when will I steream again.

&gt;You don't have to stream for lots of viewers ofr money, when one person appreciates what you do, and is thankful about it, it feels great.

764rav,Messages on past broadcasts are worse than useless since they are only ever used for spoilers,"Title says it.  Every VOD I watch, I have to remember to go in and turn off messages added after the broadcast, since the only times I have seen them used is some idiot who is determined to spoil the outcome of a competition for people like me who are watching after it originally broadcast.

I've worked as a computer programmer before, and I know how much it stinks to spend a lot of time and effort programming something, only to have it be completely removed because it's totally useless.  But: adding messages after the broadcast should be completely removed, because it's worse than useless.

If Twitch wants to add a separate comments section to VODs the way YouTube has them, fine.  But allowing people to add messages into chat after the broadcast is nothing but trouble and should be completely removed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/764rav/messages_on_past_broadcasts_are_worse_than/,1507901174.0,66,0.87,14,Twitch,Gorm_the_Old

75y3j8,Dont play Copyright music on streams,"Relatively comfortable sized affiliate streamer is currently on twitter blowing up hardcore because their channel has been 'indefinitely suspended for a dmca claim' against her stream.

No official statement from twitch - but apparently she was using the royalty free nightcore music playlist - and was not contacted prior to her channel being struck off the list.
The current Partnership manager for twitch is discussing the matter on twitter with people saying it's perfectly normal and your channel will be removed if 'breaking the law'

No idea what to make of it all for the moment, but for now those of you that rely on song request bots / playlists (even royalty free ones) - maybe not do that for a while.

EDIT :- as brought up very appropriately by u/zMASKm in the thread, it is only the streamer who is pinning this on copyright music cock ups - whereas the DMCA could have been for multiple violations of ANY kind across her content.
At this point likelihood of twitch going on a rampage slaughtering us for our kate bush collection streams are quite low, but be sensible about using content that is not your own across streams.

Edit 2:- from u/Sachburger - She just tweeted this picture: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DL9tsZbX4AA2BLL.jpg:large
Basically twitch sent out the wrong email it seems and she was banned for something completely unrelated to any music/copyright.

Looks like she suffered the 'bank account suspicious of bits' issue - which led to her account being banned - and they sent the wrong email and as suspected this was nothing - as you were",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/75y3j8/dont_play_copyright_music_on_streams/,1507825371.0,71,0.7,118,Twitch,OmegaCydonia

I had a bad day at work, one or two viewers were in my channel but there was relatively no interaction, and I had some issues with my sound that I was trying to work out. I was thinking about calling it quits a little bit early and was feeling a bit discouraged until...

Suddenly I got my first host ever! I know for most of you this may not sound like a big deal, but to a small streamer that has been streaming daily for a few weeks and staying between 3-8 viewers, it was incredible. When I saw the message that 26 viewers were now joining me and the chat began to move faster than I had ever seen, I was ecstatic. I never thought I would ever be on the receiving end of a host, let alone one with viewers in double digits. 

Big shout out to the Shadowverse stream community, they are very supportive of one another. Thank you to all of you who encourage small streamers during the low points to continue doing what they love!

Also, tissue networks will send us fresh skin from surgeries (tummy tuck, breast reduction, etc)  that we  chop up and extract cells from.  

It really isn't gorey at all, in fact watching my blood draw is more gorey.

Any twitch staff out there to give me an okay?

Edit: Seems like this post is generating some interest. Just wanted to clear a few things up!

1) Before I am accused; mods and others, this post wasn't a plug for my stream, just a genuine question. 

2) I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking I strictly stream science. I actually stream games and irl more. Given the nature of my research, its sometimes hard to stream while keeping full attention on the experiment. I do stream science, and am working on getting a schedule into place!

71xu6h,Noise suppression is honestly the best feature of OBS Studio. You might not need a new mic just turn this filter on!,"My PC is on my desk next to my monitor. It's an mITX build but still powerful so when I play a demanding game obviously the fans turn on. And OBS always picks up that background noise. Well that was annoying for me. I used noise gate but that just removes the noise when you don't talk. As soon as I started talking the background noise was there.

And then I realized there is a filter called ""noise suppression"". Well that removed the whole background noise and actually I can keep my mic always on. The difference is day and night.

I'm just sharing this story because I was thinking about picking up a new headset or mic just because of this. Obviously having a good quality mic is nice but if you are on a tight budget like me this little filter can save you a lot of money.

6zwd06,"Oversaturated game, is it worth it to stream it?","So I did a week solid of streaming on twitch, every night from 9pm est to roughly 2am est.

Not a single viewer.  Literally not a single one.

I tried a few nights the next week. 

Not a single viewer.

The game of course is PUBG but thats sort of the game I want to play.  And I was interested in streaming because the game so exciting and has such little ""boring af"" parts to it.

Other wise I typically play long ass 4x strategy  games, which would be a snore for a viewer.

Now I wonder if it's worth to stream at all while PUBG is so crazy popular.  I want to get into streaming but I literally have had zero interaction in the past three weeks and have never gone beyond two viewers  (one was a friend helping check my audio  levels and the other myself).

Am I just adding to the saturation? Should I just power through it and hope for some cool chatters to make friends with eventually? Or am I just eating away at my bandwidth and causing my wifes netflix to buffer for no reason?


Edit: Alot of great responses!  Thanks guys! I got four lurkers last night because Ironically PUBG was down for patching first twoish hours stream.

6zl5ol,Just had one of the best days streaming today :),"Today was pure magic.

--------

**Started off the stream like every other day.** 

Started the stream, opened chat, made sure my view count was hidden, and just started playing. 

At the start, my usual guys who join instantly joined and I spoke with them for a bit. 2 of them joined in playing with me and 1 chilled in the chat. Though, once my games started, it became different than the usual. I don't know what it was but we simply had an amazing time playing and chatting. Tons of laughs and true enjoyment. 

**After about a game or two of PUBG (40 minutes), my other regulars started coming in and started chatting, as well.**

My chat was laughing, talking to each other, and reacting to almost everything that happened. This was different as chat is usually just a few lines every few minutes and most don't talk to each other. This time it was an insane amount as people were chiming in with ""hahaha"" ""you're an idiot"" ""OMG"" etc and just making friends with each other. Basically, what you would see from a bigger streamer with a lot of chatters. Seeing that honestly made me be more comfortable while streaming, as if I was around my family. I didn't have to constantly think about things to do, it just came natural. 

**For about 6 straight hours, almost everything I/we did in-game caused the chat to go mental and laugh/react in an amazed way.**

It honestly felt so amazing when I saw this and I can see how bigger streamers, like Shroud for instance, can do 12 hour+ streams without batting an eye. People who joined (I can see who is new due to a program I have; doesn't shout out lurkers (PLEASE NEVER SHOUT THEM OUT; THEY WILL LEAVE)) nearly instantly followed and wanted to join in on the fun times. I invited a few to play with me and even they were having a blast and said they were def coming back tomorrow.

After the 6 hours is when my main guys usually go to sleep (a lot of them are from the EU so it's 4AM there usually around that time). It became quiet as I only had maybe 4 chatters left but they still were chiming in which is rare af. I streamed for another 30 minutes and got off once those other 4 chatters got off as well.

* Couldn't help but listen to ""It Was a Good Day"", by Ice Cube, after :D

-------

**TBH, I needed this.** 

Days like these aren't something new to me but I haven't had one in a good while so that's why, I guess, it felt so amazing. Have been on a bit of a slump recently (emotionally) so this has def bounced me back up to being motivated and happy :) Streaming has been hard, been doing it for 6 months. Lots of Ups and Downs came along. Days like these, though, give me the motivation to get through another 6 months. 

Never give up just because you had a bad day. There will be many. You'll obtain 0 followers or 0 new viewers but soon you'll get a day with more viewers than normal or more followers than you've ever thought was possible. Cherish these days, the good ones, and remember back to them as these are the days that will push you further and will get you through all the bad and to all the good. :)

I started streaming on September 25th 2016, so I'm just shy of my 1 year streamiversary. Over the last 11.5 months, I have made countless friends, gaming buddys and had many amazing memories made. The communities I have become a part of, and the one that came together around my channel has been an amazing thing to be a part of.

2 days ago I hit 1,000 followers and 10,000 channel views, crazy! I thought when I started 'if I get 100 followers I will be very happy!'. I stream first and foremost to make friends, and I started in memory of my friend who passed away in order to raise money for the charity that supported him throughout his life with a severe disability.

Twitch has helped me honour his memory and for that I am eternally grateful and I can't begin to explain how happy and proud of what has happened over the last 12 months.

6xz6e5,The wait is over! Purple+ is now here. Important information about your TwitchDB intros and more within!,"Hi everyone! [](#HeyGuys)

Yesterday [I showed off a few screenshots of an upcoming project](https://redd.it/6xs5q8): Purple+. This site is a successor to http://twitchdb.tv, http://twoos.twitchdb.tv and https://requests.twitchdb.tv. **It's now here!** [](#PogChamp)

[You can have a look around Purple+ here](https://purple.plus). There are far too many changes for me to list them all individually, so I would encourage you all to take a look and find them all for yourselves. To name the most prominent though:

- Profiles expanded to cater for everyone, not just streamers.
- There is a new Query Database tool for powerful searches. 
- We've got a brand new layout and colour scheme (including optional nightmode).
- Full Help Documentation is now available.
- Approved Advertisement requests are now publicly available.
- New Schedule Page to help you find new streams.
- You can feature one of your clips on your profile.
- Profiles support more social media sites.
- Profiles also allow you to add subreddits, Discord servers, Steam groups, etc.
- Profiles now even support Twitch and BTTV emotes!
- We will now give you a reason if your profile is rejected.
- You can ""bookmark"" your favourite profiles and add notes to them.
- You can see how many people have viewed your profile.
- The Twoos transactions page has been made a lot better.
- Plus a lot of fixed bugs from TwitchDB.

The list goes on, but I'll keep this relatively short for now.

***PLEASE NOTE THAT LEGACY TWITCHDB INTROS WILL NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED.*** Unfortunately, TwitchDB intros and Purple+ profiles are not fully compatible and a database migration wasn't possible. However, some fields will automatically be filled with TwitchDB data when you go to submit a profile if you did have an intro. 

There are currently 5734 intros on TwitchDB, and we've got absolutely no idea how many will be transferred across - so please be patient when waiting for your profile to be approved. We will be working around the clock to try and keep on top of them. [](#panicBasket)

***ALL LEGACY INTROS, TWOOS AND ADVERTISEMENT REQUESTS WILL BE LOST AFTER OCTOBER 1ST.***

I would also encourage everyone to provide as much feedback for the site as possible. The site so far has been created as it is because of community feedback on TwitchDB, and I hope to be able to continue that.

Finally, I would like to close by thanking all of the other contributors to this project:

- /u/Decicus for hosting the project and helping bring all this together!
- /u/distortednet for the original TwitchDB project.
- /u/sargasm_gaming for providing the artwork for the trophies.
- /u/EthicMeta &amp; /u/Greuxn for contributing to the help articles, beta testing and extra invaluable support.
- The team of beta testers:
  - /u/BoomLiam

6x1ma7,"[PSA] Please Always Get WHOIS Protection, When Registering a Domain Name!!!","Ok, folks. I can't stress this enough, and would like to remind you about WHOIS protection, when registering a domain name. 

Last week, I went on another browsing spree on Twitch for small streamers to checkout/watch/follow/connect with etc. 

I realized, there are more and more people now, who go above and beyond to make a nice channel. That includes making a website for their channels as well (wasn't that common few years back). 

Here is a catch though!!! When registering a domain name. Please, spend a few dollars more  for WHOIS protection! Heck, some websites offer it for free for the first year. 

Registering under fake credentials, under a friend or relative, will NOT help you. It will still put you and/or others at risk! 

I came across two streamers, who had websites without WHOIS protection. One completely overlooked it, but said, he'll fix it. Another guy told me ""I'm not too worried, I didn't register it. So it's not me, lol."" What??? I tried to change his mind, but it was pointless.

6wumyz,WebM: The gem of making custom VIDEO alerts! A guide to excellence,"Good day wonderfuls of the Twitch subreddit! Since recently Streamlabs has been upping their game **AND** upped their storage for streamers to 1gb (with 25MB filesize limit), I have felt the need to share this with the world.

Please keep in mind this is moreso for the people who already know their beginnings with making videos - if you don't, there's thousands of tutorials that I learn it from. Best get started!
__________________________

This is going to be mainly about rendering out a video in the **WebM** format which works with a lot of alert services (Only Muxy and Streamlabs are really relevant for me).
Let me go ahead and show you an example of one of these in action: https://gfycat.com/LinedFrightenedCattle

_________________

**STEP 1: CREATING AN ALPHA VIDEO**

We are going to work on this *without* chroma keying out any sort of background. So when creating your alert, make sure it has no background and is completely alpha (checkered dots usually indicate this). 

**100% Make sure that the video is as long as you want your alert to be regardless of the content in it. Let's say your animation takes 5 seconds and you want an 8 second alert, your last 3 seconds will be empty. This is just my workaround to not have the alert repeat on Streamlabs for longer durations and short videos.**


I've already created something I wanted to perhaps put up for sale so I'll be rendering it out with you guys. Here's how it looks in After Effects: https://gfycat.com/GrotesqueOrneryBassethound

_______________

**STEP 2: THE PLUGIN TO RENDER AS WEBM**

Rendering as WebM is not naturally possible in Adobe Media Encoder / Premiere. You're going to need a plugin for this which is: http://www.fnordware.com/WebM/ **OR** you can use FFMPEG to convert an alpha video into WebM, but this is a lot more intricate and I can't really go into that right now.

edit: as pointed out by /u/spktralco: One can use [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/) to turn a .MOV file with Alpha into a WebM with alpha. I personally don't know how true this is for other video formats with alpha into WebM though, try it out I'd say.

___________________

**STEP 3: RENDERING IT OUT**

I personally use Adobe Media Encoder and have minimal experience with Premiere since I'm a Sony Vegas fanboy, so I'll be showing you the settings that I use personally. I have no perfect knowledge of what these all are - but I'm pretty confident that I'm going for maximum quality output.

**The key detail is to tick on the Alpha channel,  screenshot album will be included.**

Album: http://imgur.com/a/LsaXS

____________________

**STEP 4: FINAL PRODUCT ON ALERT SYSTEM**

I am going to assume you are already sort of well versed with the alert system you are working with as to changing the basics like Font and whatnot.

Go to the media and just upload our file, remember the max filesize on Streamlabs is 25MB. Set the rest of the settings and you should get something a little along the lines of this...

https://youtu.be/qfCaEGvjpAs

__________

I would 100% recommend people to look up tons of tutorials on how to make alerts, you can really make yourself something fancy if you get creative enough! 

I am going to bed soon but if there's any questions that need to be answered from the comments or DMs I'll get back to you!

6wfjk7,Small streams still make a difference,"(I hope this is okay to post here)

I'm a small, *small* time streamer, currently aiming for Affiliate and over the past few days have found it hard to muster the energy to stream as it started to feel a little bit futile. 

After a hot, humid day I decided to jump on stream and play some HotS for a little while when one of regulars came on and started watching. 

They chatted for a bit before telling me that their boyfriend broke up with them earlier that week and that they'd had a pretty crap week. He wanted to take his minds of things a bit so I didn't press the matter too much and just spent a couple hours chatting with him whilst playing about Overwatch and random other stuff. 

After I finished the stream, I got a message saying that it had really helped them with their situation, and was excited to tune in again the next day, as I'll hopefully be jumping into the Destiny beta. 

Just made me realise that after a rough patch wondering if it was worthwhile, that even smaller streams still have an impact on people, and gives someone a place to escape and relax. So to anyone out there who may be in the same boat, or wondering whether or not it's worth while; go for it. Keep going. It's genuinely making a difference, and those human interactions are what streaming is really all about (for me anyway). 

My resolve has been renewed, and I'm now genuinely looking forward to streaming when I can going forward. :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6wfjk7/small_streams_still_make_a_difference/,1503876142.0,166,0.92,44,Twitch,Wortermelon

6w886i,"UtiliTwitch- Free chrome extension that adds sorting options to Twitch. Find new/smaller streams sorting by lowest viewers first, random, and more.","**TL;DR-** UtiliTwitch is a free chrome app that adds more sorting options to game directories e.g. sort from Low-High viewers instead of the default high to low. It's still pretty rough and there are definitely bugs, but I wanted to gauge how much interest there was before putting too much more time into it. 

**Still too long?** [here's a gif](https://gfycat.com/DearAdoredGnatcatcher)

**Download here:** [UtiliTwitch on the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utilitwitch/kicbnicedhdefmgfbmnkcfocedlcoonl)

On this sub there are frequent questions along the lines of ""how do smaller streamers increase visibility"" or ""how do you discover smaller streamers"" etc, and someone will almost always comment that Twitch should implement an option to randomise the order in which streams are displayed, or give the option to sort them in reverse. I cobbled together a free chrome extension that adds both of these and more into the site.

Currently the options for sorting are: by viewers, uptime, account age, alphabetical(by stream title), and random. These could easily be changed to any other stat given by the Twitch API. 

Speaking of which, UtiliTwitch also has the unintended ability to update the streams shown in a game directory without having to refresh the entire page.

The extension is in very rough beta. It works (mostly) but it has bugs. It doesn't currently work properly in directories that Twitch has customised eg cs:go, and it works but displays badly or has other bugs in Overwatch and Creative. These seem fixable. It also doesn't work in conjunction with other sort options like language or those in LoL or Hearthstone. 

Why release it if it doesn't work 100%? a) It's free. If people absolutely hate it, they can just uninstall and they haven't lost anything bar a few minutes, but more so, b) working around the Twitch site is a PITA. I'd like to gauge how much interest there is rather than keep sinking time into something that nobody may end up using.

6w510b,unskippable 30 second ads,"I never encountered this until about 3 or 4 weeks ago but now opening a stream I am seeing an unskippable ad, often 30 seconds long and always the same.
Strangely, on my notebook I am able to skip after 5 seconds. 

What's up with that and why is the interaction so different on my two systems?  

Also why even be this obnoxious?

I haven't checked out a single new channel since this first appeared. I am not going to sit through a long ad just to take an impulse peek. 

Ads like these are exactly why I use an adblocker. I whitelist whenever I am asked nicely and not made to regret it. But I will make a conscious effort to disable any and all amazon related ads as a basic principle forever now.

6vud0w,"Introducing, One Monitor Twitch Chat! [Tool]","Hey /r/Twitch!


* With the approval from the /r/Twitch moderators, I can showcase my small project I've been working on! That is the One Monitor Twitch Chat.

**Overview**

* OMTC is a small program I have made that enables Twitch streamers to be able to read their Twitch chat whilst only having 1 monitor. The tool will overlay **any game that is being played in borderless** and will be click-through, you can also change the opacity of the program using the hotkeys F1 &amp; F2.

* I made this to cater to the people that don't have dual screen monitors or any other way of being able to view their chat, hopefully this helps as much people as it can! The entire project is also on [github](https://github.com/aylsero/One-Monitor-Twitch-Chat) if you'd like to see, and or edit the code/project if you wish!

* This is my first tool I've ever released to the public, please be aware it might come with some bugs and faults (In the case you find any please post them here), but the tool will ask you to update if there is ever a new version available.

6viyki,One piece of advice:,"I've been on Twitch now for a better part of two years.  I'll never forget what it was like to stream in front of nobody, then getting your first viewer that wasn't an irl friend, and then continuing to grow and eventually achieving partnership.  However, there is one important message to ALWAYS remember.  Don't expect anybody to be in your chat because they owe you nothing.  It's easy to lose grasp of that as you start to grow and numbers become a little more important.  ALWAYS be thankful of what and who you have!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6viyki/one_piece_of_advice/,1503495012.0,66,0.88,36,Twitch,KratosRising
6vhebl,"Had my first active night and it was great! Thanks, Twitch, for creating this platform!","I just had my first good stream and I'm super excited. ""Good stream"" can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people, and I know what ""good"" is to me is probably nothing to most other people, but wanted to share anyway!

I've struggled for a while to maintain a schedule (I work 50ish hours a week and am taking classes, as well as have a dog to take care of on my own), get people to watch me, etc. I've tried dabbling in many things I read online, but ultimately have just been struggling.

Tonight I decided to start with BOTW and stick with it if I felt like it--well, I felt like it.

Pretty soon I see I have 2 viewers--nbd, happens regularly but only for a split second. Soon enough the ""2 viewers"" number sticks around for a while, and one of them starts chatting with me a LOT. This particular person told me some personal stuff that communicated to me they might have a hard time communicating with others IRL, and so I really thought their opening up was pretty awesome. They then continued to chat with me for hours!

Just having that single person extra meant more and more people stopped by, because I was bumped up the list. I've ***never*** had 4 viewers at once, and tonight I had 4 viewers for extended periods of time quite regularly, and even got up to 5 viewers! I've also not had someone follow me while I was live in a LONG time (only 8 follows total, to be clear), and sure enough towards the latter part of the stream someone who stopped by and started chatting in addition to the first person decided to follow! I've never had someone who began chatting actually follow me, so this was a big deal for me.

Though I spend all day working with people at work (albeit cranky ones, usually), outside of that I'm usually incredibly shy, I feel sort of paralyzed when I have to interact with new people, for various reasons I tend to come off as standoffish or cranky, and generally I just want to keep to myself because of all that. So, for me, part of streaming is learning how to interact with people in a way that feels good to me, rather than stressful and terrible. Chatting with the people who stopped by my stream tonight felt amazing. It's not like we had some deep conversation about life and death, but just knowing that there are people out there who are easy to talk to, that they liked chatting with me--as trivial as I know that sounds, it felt so freaking great.

I know this all seems silly and trivial, and in the grand scheme of things I know that streaming video games isn't the most important thing on earth. I'm a grown-ass man with a serious job during the day, and if my family knew I was streaming they'd probably be worried I had a brain tumor. I get it. But I've found I really just love streaming even when no one's watching. I get to do one of my favorite things and interact with new people who think it's just as fun as me. So, thanks, Twitch, for providing this platform, and thanks to everyone on Twitch who helped provide tips on this subreddit or just contributes to the Twitch community in general!

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the comments and checking out/following the stream everyone! That was definitely not expected and each time I got the email ping at work it made my day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6vhebl/had_my_first_active_night_and_it_was_great_thanks/,1503473257.0,115,0.88,43,Twitch,cancerofpassion

I'd never have thought in a million years something like that would ever happen to me but it did and it was the best stream I've done so far. I'm at 39 followers now and it's just an amazing feeling.

6uhk6q,Ads on twitch become atrocious,"Okay so before you down-vote me to hell and mention how the company needs to make money blah blah blah, just hear me out.

Recently tw made it so any stream you check out, it will run an ad before you can start watching, and whats even worse, sometimes when you watch a stream and lose connection (might not be even your fault but on twitch's end) it will run an ad as well! *e/ (apparently for some people it isn't the case and it's how it always has been, my experience is as such though, I didn't used to see an ad for every channel out there)*

You are watching a stream, lose connection for a second and bam, 45sec ad you gotta watch and miss out on the action because hurr durr, we need to make money. 

My main problem with this is basically that I'm missing out on the action. Wanna run an ad during the stream? Sure, make it so it runs when the streamer is on a break or something, *like it used to be*.

For comparison just imagine watching your favorite show only for it to be interrupted by an ad and completely missing out what happened during that time, because the show didn't pause for you to finish watching the ad.

*It happened to me once*, I was watching grubby's stream and I actually interacted with him by asking a question in the chat, guess what? **His answer was blocked by a 45 sec ad I couldn't get rid of**, thanks twitch for the amazing experience created by your ad-system. I had to play the vodcast the next day and find the time that I missed just to see what he said, horrible stuff. *(for clarification, it was a 1-sec DC that started the ad playing, not the streamer himself).*

It also brings another point: **well done on driving me away from new streamers and content**, and I am 100% sure I'm not alone in this.

When I open up twitch, I look at the channels and see whats going on, and I can't be bothered seeing what other people are doing simply because of the ads that run for **every single channel I try to check out**. Even if you play the ad, then decide the channel isn't what you are looking for and look for something else, hey-ho you gotta see another one of our 45 seconds ad to proceed!

Twitch, you are taking my hate on ads to a new level. I basically hate every single thing being shown by the ads on tw, not sure how that's supposed to help anyone.

By the way, Im not saying to get rid of ads completely, just make it so it doesn't get in the way of the viewers experience so much..",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6uhk6q/ads_on_twitch_become_atrocious/,1503060236.0,307,0.88,164,Twitch,antyone

* step number two , Open the client and the app and enter your ip adress into the client and wait for it to connect. You are now pretty much done with DroidCam now you can just press start to get it working.

* step number three, Open OBS studio and right click sources&gt;add&gt;Video Capture device then name it and press device you'll want to choose DroidCam source 3.  And now you're all done.

Option number two: IP Webcam

6ti9xf,If Twitch charged a 5% upcharge on bits instead of 40% it would be used so much more than Paypal donations.,"I can't honestly bring myself to use Bits when so much is lost in the middle compared to Paypal. From a donator POV I know I'm not going to chargeback, but I hear stories of streamers having to deal with that. Bits seem much more reliable to receive, but the donation loses a lot of value when going from Donator to Streamer if you're an honest donator, compared to the ~4% Paypal takes.


Obviously its a processing fee + extra for Twitch pockets, but if Twitch lowered the % they charged extra on the bits I think it would be used much more often, resulting in more profits for Twitch. Even though each transaction it would be less $ skimmed off, much more would take place resulting in more profit I think.


What's everyone's thoughts on this?



Edit: ""40% upcharge"" is referring to the [markup](https://strategiccfo.com/markup-percentage-calculation/)  not the % of Twitch vs the Streamer.


Edit 2:  [a quick graph I made of the Markup Vs. Donation for PayPal and Bits](http://imgur.com/Bc1moZx.png)  the upcharge is only comparable at $1 and PayPal still is better. Past $1 PayPal becomes even more ideal as an even higher % of money goes to the streamer.  To compare PayPal to Bits I entered the Markup % for $1, $5, $15, $50, $100 and $250 since those are the quantities you can load bits to your account in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6ti9xf/if_twitch_charged_a_5_upcharge_on_bits_instead_of/,1502663428.0,705,0.95,180,Twitch,bitobittys

6seoan,"To everyone who is always saying ""Don't give up, growing a channel takes time""","**THANK YOU!** You were right!
I started to stream regularly in May and since then I've streamed on about 70 days for an average of around 4 hours.

[**This**](http://imgur.com/gallery/ekC9j) is my Twitch stats page of the last 7 days. This week is the first time I have a few viewers who actively participate in chat! Yes, of course I had someone come by and chat for a few minutes in the past but this feels like more than just some random visits.

I do not advertise my channel, nor am I the person who actively networks (I wouldn't really know how and where) and I don't really have any real-life friends who would be interested in my streams either...

So what changed? Why is my average viewer number suddenly greater than 0 or 1?

I guess **I've changed**!  My mother always said ""*Es ist noch kein Meister vom Himmel gefallen*"" which literally translates to ""*There still aren't any masters that have fallen from the sky.*""
In the past months I got **a lot of practice** in streaming! And I guess a lot of people here on this sub need exactly this practice as well. Because sitting in front of the camera, playing a video game and trying to be entertaining requires different skills than memeing in Twitch chat...

English is not my native language and today I must say that I feel way more comfortable expressing myself in that language than before. I've always had conversations in English for my job, but holding an improvised 4 hours monologue is simply just different than a normal conversation. I streamed Witcher 3 and read every book out loud. Trust me, in the beginning every time I read a book that one viewer I occasionally had was gone immediately. Why? Because I was bad at it which made it boring. I needed practice.

Last Sunday I streamed 5.5 hours of Pyre which was really just me reading text out loud the entire time until my voice gave up. I now have enough confidence to to that. Because I had enough practice.

Of course I am never done practicing, but it such a good feeling to finally see some rewards. I'm just having so much fun right now with streaming and actually getting some immediate feedback in chat :)

I've never actively participated in this sub, but I've been lurking here for ages. So to all of you who actively participated in the last few years and shared your tips, tricks and experiences: Thank you very much for keeping me motivated!

I hope I could motivate an other person with this post to keep practicing! Good luck with your channel!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6seoan/to_everyone_who_is_always_saying_dont_give_up/,1502210088.0,81,0.81,62,Twitch,r3zn1kakaPJFry
6s7z0a,Quick advice for new streamers who stream PUBG and are having trouble gaining or keeping any viewers.,"Advice: Don't stream PUBG.  
   
It's a popular PC game that's super easy to stream, so it has billions of streamers.  
If you stream PUBG, your channel will be burried underneath hundreds of thousands of other channels with zero or one viewer.  
It's a terrible stream game for people who don't already have an established audience.  Even if you're getting those fake app followers, you're not getting real viewers.  
  
Multiple times a week I see people post here because they can't find viewers.  They'll talk about the games they play or they'll link their profile, and 90% of the time it's a PUBG stream.  
  
I get it.  You like the game and want to stream something you like.  But you need to understand that there are consequences to streaming this game.  
  
Not trying to sound like a dick, but it's not a good stream game.  You're not only picking the category with the most competition, but the category with the strongest competition as well since some of the biggest streamers out there play PUBG.  
  
It's just a bad market.  
   
There are other games this applies to as well, but PUBG is a big one that I see most often here.

6s2zvy,"Introducing Streamplex, a MultiTwitch-style stream viewer with instant active stream/chat switching","It's a multi-stream viewer with one large main stream that has audio and chat, and live, muted thumbnails of the other streams, with the ability to instantly swap out the active stream with a click (including audio and chat). I made it while trying to keep up with the half-dozen Evo streams I was trying to watch a few weeks ago, and found all of the other MultiTwitch-style sites didn't quite fit my needs. Check it out and let me know what you think.

**Important note:** at the moment, it's optimized for widescreen desktop/laptop monitors. It probably won't work well on portrait-oriented monitors, 4:3 monitors, tablets, or cell phones.

6rd8wb,I created a web based subathon/sellout timer that increases the countdown time based on tips/bits/subs,"Link: https://marathontimer.herokuapp.com

No ads or anything, totally free. Simply created a tool that I thought people might be interested in. It is a subathon countdown timer that you can add to obs/xsplit as a browser source. The text has some customization options to help the timer fit in your layout.

You set the starting time, and the maximum amount of time, and it starts counting down. When someone subs/tips, the timer will increase by the amount you specify. This allows you to do subathons/sellout marathons where a sub can add 10 minutes of stream time, a resub can add a different amount of time, bits add 1 minute, etc. It will also now differentiate between the different tiers of subs and resubs.

By linking your twitch account, it can get bits/subs/resubs. To use tips, you must link a streamlabs account. It does not work with anything else right now.

I am a self taught coder, and this is my first web based app, so there will probably be bugs. If you find any bugs, please let me know. Also, if there are any suggestions or questions please let me know.

Edit: If anyone plans on using this for a marathon, message me and let me know! I'd be interested in hopping in and making sure everything works right and watch",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6rd8wb/i_created_a_web_based_subathonsellout_timer_that/,1501775913.0,91,0.95,30,Twitch,boothin

If you have ANY questions throughout this guide please don't be afraid to ask. 

WARNING: I AM DOING THIS ON AN IPHONE, SO PLEASE BARE WITH ME IF FORMATTING IS A BIT OFF.

So I'm going to provide some links and explain what they are going to do for you as a twitch streamer.

https://muxy.io/ - Muxy is my choice of overlay/donation tracker. It connects to all the basic websites and becomes optimal for anyone who wants to become larger :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

http://chatty.github.io/#download - I use this for chat! I use this because I like the fact it shows everyone who is watching your stream. You can also set it up so you can see when someone enters your stream without it actually ""welcoming"" them.

https://obsproject.com/download - Self explanatory. If you need help setting up your dimensions/bitrate you can always message me directly.

https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/twitch-streamers-tool-for-single-monitor-streamers.364/ - I was using this when I had one monitor. It displays the chat transparently so it won't get in the way of your game! 

http://www.speedtest.net/ - test that speed. Make sure you CAN stream. Try to keep upload above 5mbps for general gaming.

First off, if you're planning on becoming popular then please, have patience. This isn't something that you'll wake up and have 5m followers. It's a grind. 

Second off, interact. You downloaded Chatty for a reason, use it! :)

3: Play. Tips are only so good, you must play. Luckily enough twitch as a community is good for first time streamers. If you're going to stream league of legends if you do really good in game, post your twitch link and ask people to say hi! Simple as that!

If you play games such as: 

Runescape
Any sports game
Small indie games

You will most likely have a higher chance of getting that FIRST viewer!

6qbd2x,"Mini-Rant: New Streamers, please treat viewers as people, not a statistic.","I love watching new/small streamers, the interaction, the awkwardness of starting out, etc. But there's quite a few I notice see viewers as less as a person and more of a number.    
    
One example from the other night, I hopped into an Overwatch stream, it had 2 viewers including me. I said something and the streamer said ""Hi, also if you like what you see, make sure to hit that follow button."" After that, the streamer said nothing and went back to playing Overwatch. It felt less like trying to get to know someone and more of someone trying to get something from me. Maybe some viewers are okay with this or pay no attention, but as a streamer myself, I never introduce myself like this. I see a new viewer as a potential friend, and that is no way to introduce yourself. it seems like a streamer cares more about their follower count than actually getting to know you because if you leave, they'll just ask the next person in chat.    
    
Another big thing that really irks me is people who ask other people to lurk in their chat to boost viewer count and thus gaining more exposure on the category list. Again, focusing on numbers. They don't care if there's no chat interaction from these people lurking, they just want numbers. Do they not find it strange that there's 5 people you asked to be in your chat and there's no one talking? Might as well be streaming to 0 people.    
    
And similar to that is people who do ""follow for follow"", but I'm sure you know about that by now. They (usually) don't care about you as a streamer or your content, as long as they know their numbers are increasing.    
    
With that being said, those streamers don't treat new viewers as actual people it seems. They are more interested in numbers (follower count, view count, donations, follower goals, getting affiliation, etc) than the viewer individually. And seeing the threads here about ""How do I get more viewers?"" ""I have no regular viewers."" One possible reason is how you treat the viewers that do come in. I really do think first impressions are everything, especially on a platform like twitch.    
    
Think about it, there are hundreds of thousands of streams that are live at a given time. For 1 new person to choose to check out your stream, even just for a minute, is something incredible. Imagine you are at an author who wrote a book that's in a library. And seeing someone choose to read your book out of all the other thousands of other books there. Incredible, no? DOES NO ONE FIND THIS AMAZING?! That's why it's so hard for me understand how a streamer sees viewers as a number. Maybe I'm thinking way too into this. Scratch that, I'm definitely looking way too into this, but it's something I wanted to share as a different mindset for streaming when starting out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6qbd2x/minirant_new_streamers_please_treat_viewers_as/,1501340128.0,68,0.79,42,Twitch,[deleted]
6qaphz,An Important Piece of Advice,"So I've been doing pretty well for myself recently with my streams, getting 10 viewers per stream with a very active chat.

Well on my last stream somebody came in and had a good time chatting and all was well. THEN, when I mentioned I'd be ending soon they PMed me ""hey, do you think I could get a host?"" I didn't respond as I thought that was rude right off the bat, but hey I figured maybe I'd check him out after stream and give him a shot (maybe he really doesn't know any better and I can help him out). Well, when I check him out he's sitting on stream saying that I went offline, then they refresh their page and look for other people to host them! He was literally watching other streams begging for hosts on stream.

PLEASE! DON'T DO THIS! That immediately put me off his stream and I will NEVER go back, this is not networking, this is begging.

PS: I'm truly willing to help people and give advice, just PM me your stream on here and I will give it a look and try to help out where I can.

6px1v6,"How to deal with non-trolls, yet awkward/intense viewers?","Hi,

I'm sure I can't be the only one dealing with this (either now or in the past). Throughout my days on Twitch, I've had good ol' trolls like all streamers... they're pretty easy to deal with. Either ignore or ban and everyone moves on. 

However, I find myself having a difficult time dealing with viewers who are nice and friendly, but super intense/socially awkward people. I try to be understanding as I can see how some people who hang out on Twitch are looking to find a community where they can feel safe to discuss things in their lives with other human beings, but sometimes it gets too intense/too much. For example, they'd write a bunch of little paragraphs on how their relationship is doing bad or how they're miserable in general...

Here's the thing, I love talking about mental health, experiences and stuff. But when it gets too personal, too often, I never know what to say or do. I have brought up the issue in private with that person and they stop for like a day and then it comes back like before. Again, I try to be understanding. Ive went through depression and Im sure this person just is trying to get stuff off his/her chest. 

But imagine having a person like that every stream, talking about how miserable their life is - the whole stream - and I always read chat and respond to every little comment so I try to respond and be nice, but it gets heavy, you know. And other viewers are trying to be nice as well, but the second one of us don't answer that person, they copy-paste their message asking why me or the viewers didnt answer.

It's a tough situation. That person is by no means mean or trolling. They seem in a tough place in their head and get too intense/impatient, too often. 

What do you do? I don't want to ban them or time them out because I know they're not doing it to be annoying... I even tried to send them to Facebook groups for support in their area and stuff but they just hang out in my channel instead. 

I legit have no clue what to do. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6px1v6/how_to_deal_with_nontrolls_yet_awkwardintense/,1501172623.0,82,0.91,70,Twitch,[deleted]

6pcnrd,Stream branding for beginners,"Hey everyone, it's Aaron again. I decided to write a bit about Twitch branding, since I've seen a few people who aren't sure where to start. 

Twitch branding the thing that streamers either take extremely seriously, or don’t give two s**ts about. You either get an MS paint info section made from a 30 minute bathroom session, or you get a masterpiece from the likes of Geersart.

Branding on Twitch is highly debated on whether or not it’s actually important for the growth of your stream. And there isn’t a clear answer.

But coming from a business and twitch sponsorships background, I can say for sure that I think it’s MASSIVELY important. 

For those of you who see the benefit like me, I hope this post today can provide some value to you and show you a little bit of the basics for branding your on-stream graphics.

First off,

#Have consistent graphics across all platforms.

This is pretty basic stuff, but the number of people who don’t follow this rule is crazy.

You need to be sure that the graphics you use on stream or for your profile picture are consistent across your social media accounts, or any other account that you create content on.

You need to do this to make it extremely easy to find you on other sites. For instance, if I know you have a profile picture of a turtle on Twitch and I search you on Twitter and see a turtle, there’s no question in my head and I can hit the follow button immediately.

Also, this is important to do just to solidify your graphics and your brand as **yours**. The more you expose your viewers to your designs, the more they are going to connect with them.

#Secondly, be sure to hire a professional to do your graphics.

I’m sure you’ve heard this 8,023 times already. 

And believe me, I get it. Everyone who has ever chased their dream did not have a lot of spare cash at the beginning. It’s tempting to do your own graphics, but theres a good chance you don’t have years of design experience.

There are a few reasons I recommend going with a professional over making them yourself:

1. Professionals can connect your graphics with your personality.

Remember, branding is more than just graphics. It’s everything about your stream (personality, the way you dress, etc). So if you can find a designer who can portray **you** in your graphics, they’re a keeper.

2. Professionals can craft unique designs.

Chances are, if you haven’t made art for years, your art style is just going to be a mish mash of things that you’ve seen from other people. Professional artists have developed their own styles, which is super important for originality.

#And finally, be sure to create art for your notifications on stream.

This part is one that a lot of people forget.

With streamlabs or any other alerter, you can practice branding guidelines when someone follows, subscribes, or donates. In fact, this could be the greatest way for viewers to get exposure to your brand since it will probably be showing up the most.

One of my favorite examples of a streamer who does this well is Lirik. Those cute little cat pictures that show up everywhere are pleasing to look at, and I now associate a large part of his brand with those figures.

Doctor Disrespect also does this well. He centers a lot of his brand over his mustache, and his alerts follow this same pattern.

And that’s it!

I hope this helped you guys out if you’re just starting to take branding seriously.

6p1yad,"I'm a small streamer with 8 viewers on average, 100 followers and just blew up with one clip. I'm now the most watched twitch clip of all time","So I've been streaming around 2 months, got to about 100 followers (well 150, but 50 of those are by one troll). And have been really enjoying streaming to my small audience. 

I don't really play many scary games, and one night some one bought me Five nights at freddy's and I screamed like a little girl. From then on I learned my followers enjoyed how much I hate horror games so every Friday I've done ""Frightday"" and played scary games. I stream Mon/Wed/Fri but Fridays are always when I pull in most people. So I've made sure I've always got a good scary game ready.

I then started to play outlast 2, and had many jump scares that was clipped but one of them was perfect.

My partner went to the shop and got me a Jack Daniels (in a can) and sent me 2 year old daughter up the stairs to give it to me (My office is in the loft). Due to my headphones I never heard her enter the room. At this point a crow jumped up in the game and made me scream, I then looked down to see a devil child looking back at me and screamed blue murder.

This was the clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/StylishScrumptiousBobaTheTarFu

The clip was posted to reddit and started to get some serious views. At one point I was on target to be most watched video of the day. I then topped that and became the most watched of the week, then the month and finally of all time

I've had ladbible, youtubers etc all contact me to use my clips. I even had family members contact me saying ""WTF are you doing on my social feed this morning""

My channel jump to a 1000 followers and last night was my first stream since this all happened. I managed to pull in 80 views and it was an amazing experience.

At the moment I'm so overwhelmed by the response and happy to see people enjoying me being a pussy ;).

At this point I don't think I want my channel to grow much larger as I've always enjoyed talking to my viewers and I think if I got any more, the chat would move to fast for both me and them to enjoy.

6oxqiq,Best way to handle a $700 credit card chargeback spread out into multiple donations?,"After a bit of detective work, it seems like I have a headache of a situation on my hands. Over 4-5 days, I have had one viewer donate to me in $5 to $20 increments via credit card, and he is based overseas. 

So each time he donated, there was a 3% + .30 cent (USD) charge on top of a 2% charge for currency exchanging. 

His parents contact me and say their 11 year old used their credit card and asked for their money back, saying if I keep it it is fraud and how they wish to chargeback and then saying how they need the money since they are poor and whatnot.

Honestly I am not out to ruin people financially. I am not rich or anything, but I live a simple life and I don't want to make people unhappy even if they come off as abrasive. 

I read streamlabs policy on credit card chargebacks: https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/219435648-FAQ-for-Credit-Card-Donations and basically they state I can challenge them and if I win I keep the proceeds but that there are still some fees involved. (I think with the credit card company or something)

So here is my solution. To avoid any fees with the credit cards, currency exchange, etc, I will offer to just paypal these guys the $700 in their own currency. This can save me a lot in fees, and it saves my PayPal status since overall he donated maybe 50 times in small increments so I don't want my account status to be jeopardized. 

What do you guys think? If anyone has been through a similar experience please let me know how you handled it. Trying to get through this with the least stress possible. 


edit: You guys have a point. I don't want to give them money and then have them chargeback anyways. I will probably just dispute it all to save a headache of losing money.

6okrb0,Advice for new streamers: Please don't beg viewers to take part in whatever community stuff you're doing.,"I've been watching a lot of new streamers lately.  
People in the 5-10 viewer range.  

One common thing I've noticed a lot of them doing is using all sorts of crazy gimmicks to keep people involved in their channel, and then spend half their time BEGGING people to take part in them.  
  
Some examples include:  
  
*  Elaborate point systems designed to reward people for watching/following/subbing, but without any actual rewards
*  Bots designed to keep games running in the chat at all times
*  Huge community events that you don't have anywhere near enough viewers to support even the slightest bit

There's more, but these seem to be a few of the more common ones.  (and usually, I see most people doing ALL of them at once)  
  
I get it, you're building your stream the way you want it to be in the future, and you're hoping the viewers come in the mean time.  
But it just comes off as super pathetic when you can't even watch a streamer without getting personally begged to take part in this stuff.  
  
There's lurkers who just want to watch.  Calling them out is bad.  
And among those who are actually chatting, most of them aren't going to take part in your events.  This will hold true even for big streamers.  
  
If you were a bigger streamer, I wouldn't care as much about ignoring your community stuff because I know plenty would be interested in it.  But its kind of uncomfortable when I'm 10-20% of your viewership and you start asking me to get all the details on the event from your discord, especially when you target specific people.

6oeqg9,This front page UI is really bad... on both desktop and mobile,"The old one was fine, show the games with viewers first. Then have a separate tab for who I'm following. And a ""popular channels"" tab.

6oavlz,You want it? Go get it.,"Every day you are surrounded by quitters. You have underachievers, back stabbers, whiners, complainers, people who envy what others have. People who are looking for short cuts, easy wins, easy money, easy gains. I'm here to ask you, are you one of these people?

Streaming isn't easy. It's hard in ways few people realize when they start. It cuts into your time, your finances, your social life, your time with your dog at the park. It's daunting. It's disheartening. Demoralizing. It chews up and spits out more streamers every day than there are viewers in most games on twitch. So I'll ask a second time, is this you?

If you want something in life, anything, you gotta want it as bad as you want air. You gotta be willing to fight for it. You have to be willing to swim through the river of shit that is reality, and have faith that your strength will carry you through. You have to know, whether you feel it or not, that you're making the right move. Don't second guess yourself, even when you doubt yourself. And most importantly, don't give up.

I've seen so many streamers who are crushed by the fact that they have 0 viewers. They say, ""I've streamed for months and gotten nowhere!"" and to that I say, ""what are you going to do about it?"". Are you going to quit? Is it time to hang up your streamer hat, put the webcam away and go play Tetris in your closet alone? How bad do you want this? Because if you want it, you gotta show people you want it. You gotta show you have the commitment, resolve, dedication, motivation and DRIVE to get there. You have to inspire people, to reach out and touch their lives. You gotta be a beast. There are no short cuts. There is no easy money. There is no grand scheme to keep small streamers small, and thus there are no excuses. You need to take the words ""I can't"" and throw those out the window. You need to forget that you have 0 viewers and think about how you're going to get your next 10. You gotta remember that ANYONE who is complaining about how hard something is, is the type of person to give up when things get tough, and anyone who gives up so easily will never make it on Twitch. This isn't a sprint, its a marathon, and you're probably on your first 100 yards. Stop worrying about how far you have to run, forget about how tired you are, or all the other excuses you make in your mind when you're looking for reasons to give up. Don't let ANYTHING stop you from reaching your goals.

I'm not here to talk about personal experiences, or compare to big streamers, or explain stuff you can read anywhere. I'm here to tell you, yes YOU, that you can do it. there is nothing physically stopping you from going for your dreams. If you wanna be the next big streamer, then you need to get off your butt, stop wasting time, and go get it. You need to know you are going to have good days, bad days, awful days, and great days. You may even have great months, or awful months. They come and go. If you wanna grow, it starts and ends with you. Forget the viewers, the followers and the money. They are irrelevant. They are a tangible representation of who you are and the quality of your content, and the quality of your content starts with you. 

Audiences are a crutch. They make you weak. They make you feel like you've accomplished something and have become successful. They shower you with praise, money, friendship. They give you a sense of comfort that leads to lethargy and stagnation. You gotta stay hungry. You need to be thankful for what you have, but never accept it as good enough. When you begin to get comfortable, it's the first step to quitting. 

You're given a short period of time during a day to show an audience why you're the best damn thing on Twitch, don't WASTE it sitting there feeling lonely. Put your game face on, drink a redbull, and get out there and tear it up. You are not a quitter anymore. You're not gonna sit back and complain about your lack of viewers. You're not going to lament the fact that you have no one to talk to, you're going to go out there and BE the force that generates the tornado that is your stream. You're going to put every ounce of energy you have in the small window of time you're given to dumping EVERYTHING you have into that show, every day. You're going to show the world why you stream. And if you don't know how to channel this energy, you're not gonna stop. You're going to learn. You're going to read, watch, meet people and research your ass off until you figure it out. You're going to read books, blogs, articles, reddit posts, comment threads and Google. You're going to watch VODs, and identify your mistakes. You're going to attack this with everything, like its the last thing you have left in life, and when you leap from this cliff I PROMISE you you will soar like an eagle. 

So be the best you you can be. Show your audience that's who you are, what you represent and what they can expect from you in the future. Be honest with yourself about your goals. Because how bad do you want it? If you want it that bad, then go get it.

EDIT 3: This really exploded! in a way I never imagined it would, honestly the response from you all has been nothing but positive, I streamed a for while last night, and for those of you stopped by, Thank you, I really mean it, It was nice to actually talk to real people, even if I was rambling, and thank you for following me, even if we're in completely different time zones, I've got a few of you to check out and follow, and some more unanswered PMs to respond to, I just want to thank you all again for the support and kind words you've all given me, I'm grateful and I won't be taking advantage, I'm gunna knuckle down and do this right. Thank you! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no followers, not going to deny that, I have 2 following me, but that's out of graciousness from my friends, but when I usually stream, I have the stream playing on my phone, so I can monitor the empty chat and check the quality of my stream, and I have the stream open in Chrome, muted, just in case something is up with my phone, now that also counts as viewers, but I obviously don't count that...

Whenever I stream, I usually send out a tweet or share the stream on Facebook, tagging the game I'm playing in my tweet, in hopes that during my stream I'll gain a viewer or two, maybe a follower.

It's a bit disheartening streaming to practically no one, I haven't really been keeping to my schedule, streaming later than I should, and not for as long either, because I know no one watches anyways, I know networking is key and it all isn't going to happen overnight, I really don't want to get into this slump of ""Meh, no ones gunna see it"" kinda mentality, I really do enjoy streaming, I love the technical side and I love the streaming side, this community has helped in leaps and bounds so I have to thank you guys for actually getting me into streaming, I just feel like I'm missing something, Like I've packed my bag for a roadtrip and I'm not sure if I packed my 3DS...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6o8ot5/streaming_without_followers/,1500473348.0,81,0.89,89,Twitch,DigitalNinja125

*Twitch marathons are a wonderful thing. Bob Ross soothed our souls with happy little trees in The Joy of Painting. Fred Rogers welcomed us into his neighborhood and taught us to be good to each other in Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. We’re not yet sure what the takeaway will be for our next marathon, but make no mistake: Senpai has noticed us.*

*We’re happy to announce that on July 27, we’ll begin streaming the Crunchyroll marathon right here on [/TwitchPresents](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchpresents) *. For the unfamiliar (or the hungry), Crunchyroll is not a kind of sushi; it’s an awesome anime streaming service, and together we’ve selected over 15 anime series specifically for your viewing pleasure.*

*If you’re super into waifus and wall scrolls, tune in for a refresher or to share your thoughts on who truly is best girl. If all you know about anime starts and ends with the Twitch emote “VoHiYo,” think of the marathon like a buffet. Try a bit of everything. See what’s out there. You might find something you really like! If not, at least you’ll understand why everyone says “yelling makes you stronger.”*

*We’ll reveal the full schedule of anime soon, but for now we’d like to share a few series you’ll be able to sample, with descriptions courtesy of Crunchyroll.*

**Mob Psycho 100 (streaming July 27):**

“Mob” is a boy who has trouble expressing himself, and he happens to be a powerful esper. Mob is determined to live a normal life and keep his ESP suppressed, but when his emotions surge to a level of 100%, something terrible happens to him!

**Yuri!!! On ICE (streaming July 28):**

 Yuri Katsuki carried the hope of all Japan on his shoulders in the Figure Skating Grand Prix, but suffered a crushing defeat in the finals. He returned to his hometown and hid away in his family’s home. That’s when five-time consecutive world champion, Viktor Nikiforov, suddenly appeared at his door. Now as his coach and mentor, Viktor reshapes Yuri’s passion for figure skating in a whole new way in this 7-time Crunchyroll Award-winning favorite.

**Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid (streaming July 27):**

Miss Kobayashi is your average office worker who lives a boring life, alone in her small apartment until she saves the life of a female dragon in distress. The dragon, named Tohru, has the ability to magically transform into an adorable human girl (albeit with horns and a long tail!), who will do anything to pay off her debt of gratitude, whether Miss Kobayashi likes it or not.

**Join us starting on July 27 for the [Crunchyroll marathon](http://link.twitch.tv/crunchyrollmarathon). We’ll bring the anime. We’ll bring the emotes — speaking of which, say hello to Crunchyroll Hime, a new global emote available until August 1, for free! But we’ll definitely need you around to give Twitch Chat all your energy. Keep in mind that while Twitch is excited to bring the Crunchyroll marathon to Twitch, the content may be limited in some Asia-Pacific countries.

6nxhd8,Getting sponsored without a massive viewer count,"Hey all! It’s Aaron. I haven’t posted in a while, so I figured I’d write up a quick post that may help some of you. 

I know that for a lot of you, streaming is your dream job and hobby. How can it not be?

Before a few years ago, there weren’t nearly as many opportunities for streamers to make money doing that they love, other than subscribers and donations. But now that different brands have started to catch on to the power of Twitch streams, getting sponsored is now a viable source of side income for most streamers. The only problem is that the path to getting sponsored without 10,000 concurrent viewers is incredibly hazy, and that’s what I want to talk about today. 

I come from a business background, and I’ve talked to a lot of people who are working in the space currently sponsoring Twitch streamers; and from this, I’ve learned a lot about what it takes to get sponsored by a company. For a large majority of sponsorships, a brand will reach out to a huge streamer and set something up. And there’s a good chance that it’ll stay this way for a long time. 

But there are a few things that streamers don’t realize: 1. You don’t have to have a massive viewer count to get sponsored. 2. You don’t have to wait for brands to contact you for sponsorships; you can actively search them out yourself and achieve them. 

Hopefully, with this post I’ll be able to pass on some knowledge that I’ve gathered from the sponsorship space and shed some light on how regular streamers can tread this new territory. 

#First off, and this is a minor detail, but make your stream presentable. 

Whenever you’re reaching out to brands to get sponsored, there’s a good chance that whoever is managing the sponsorship will be checking out your Twitch channel. And one of the worst things that you can do is present them with a garbled mess of graphics and information. 

Your goal when creating your info section is to impress viewers and potential sponsors if they drop by. Brand managers want to see streamers to take their stream branding seriously, as it shows that you have a good business sense and care about quality. 

Also, I recommend having a business email in your info section somewhere. Don’t use your personal email for this, just take a few minutes to go and make one. This is more of a tip for when you’re not reaching out to brands, but it’s still a good idea. 

#Secondly, it’s important that you reach out and establish a connection with a decision maker at the brand you’re looking to get sponsored by.

Let’s face it. Business is all about relationships. And when acquiring sponsorships for your stream, you’re pretty much treating it like a business. 

And when I say forming a relationship, this can be as simple as interacting over social media and having conversations with them online. The key takeaway here is that you need to get on a decision maker’s radar. 

The best way to do this is to use the tools that are available to you on the internet. Go to a brand’s twitter page and see who they’re following. There’s a good chance that if you scroll to the bottom of their list, you’ll see a few people who work at the company. 

Or, you can use sites like LinkedIn to find the employees of a specific brand. Just type the brand’s name into linked in’s search bar and you’ll have the option to see their employees. 

The job titles that you’ll want to search for may be “Marketing Manager”, “Brand Manager”, “Talent Coordinator”, or something along those lines. 

After you’ve found a decision maker, just make contact with them over social media. Let them know who you are. Interact with their tweets, share their articles that you like, and more. 

Now, this doesn’t mean you should spam or stalk the person you’re trying to form a relationship with.

In fact, the most important thing you must keep in mind when interacting with anyone is that you MUST PROVIDE VALUE TO THEM. You must have genuine interaction, not just self-promotion or endless spamming. Talk to them like you’d talk to someone in every day life! If they have a new book coming out, buy it and send them a picture after you’re done reading it. Do they have a new article? Read the full thing carefully and leave a thoughtful comment or tweet directed at them. Things like this will get you on the radar much quicker, simply because no one else is doing it well.

#Once you feel as though you’ve gotten on the radar of someone at a brand and they know who you are, find a way to connect. 

There’s a good chance that whoever you’ve been interacting with will have an email somewhere on their social media pages that you can use to send a message. 

Or, if they don’t have an email, you can always try DM’ing them. And finally, if none of that works, send them a tweet. You should be at a point now to where they recognize your name and you’ve talked a bit, so they shouldn’t be hesitant to respond to you. 

If you do find their email on a page, be sure that when you reach out you explain where you found it and who you are. Also, you may want to look into how to craft a catchy subject line to get their attention, since they’re probably getting more emails than they can handle on a day to day basis. 

#Lastly, in your email, you need to include your proposal. 

A proposal is usually your first direct contact when actually looking to form a business relationship. 

However, before you reach out to a brand, do some research on what goals the brand might be trying to achieve. Are they looking to reach a male audience? Are they looking to increase their user base? Are they looking to drive sales of their new clothing product?

When you understand the goals of a brand, you can tell the brand exactly how you plan to help them reach those goals in your proposal. This is perhaps one of the most important parts of your proposal. 

The proposal is, in short, an explanation of why you think you should be sponsored, and how you can help the brand if they sponsor you. 

Some things that you need to be sure to include in your proposal are:

1.	Let them know what type of sponsorship you’re looking for (affiliate, pay per month, etc)
2.	Identify the marketing objectives you’ve researched
3.	Tell them how and why you can help them reach those objectives
4.	Give a brief description of your audience type. 
5.	Focus on how your stream can provide value to the brand, not about how they’re going to help you. 

If you find that the proposal is getting a bit lengthy, you can always format it in a word document and attach it onto an email explaining why you’re reaching out. 

After that, it’s the waiting game to see if they want to move forward with you. If you haven’t received a response in 1 or 2 weeks, feel free to send a follow up email to whoever you first sent the email to. That may increase the chances of an open. 

That’s all for now! I hope that this post shed some light onto how you can get sponsored on Twitch without a gigantic viewer base. 

**If you’d like, I also wrote a full post about this on my blog and added a few extra tips. If you’re interested, give it a read and share it with anyone who it may help. It’s much appreciated!** https://medium.com/powerspike/how-to-get-sponsored-on-twitch-without-a-massive-viewer-count-9a7c1c54143d

One last thing: I know a lot of people may be on the fence about whether or not they should start going for sponsorships, or whether they are ready to start given their viewer counts or something else. Here’s my advice: There is no set number of viewers that you need to have before you can start getting sponsored. I cannot tell you “You need to have atleast 50 viewers”, because technically even 1 viewer can provide some value. What I can tell you is this: Don’t go after sponsorships if you’re questioning if you’re ready or if you’re comfortable. If you don’t feel ready, then you aren’t. Give it some time and try later. I hope this clears some things up! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6nxhd8/getting_sponsored_without_a_massive_viewer_count/,1500340036.0,187,0.92,26,Twitch,PowerSpikeTV

6ngy32,"Reminder: You can stream purely for streaming, forget the numbers and marketing and enjoy yourself!","I know that this sounds like a ""duh!"" kind of statement, but with streaming becoming more mainstream and common, I think that people are beginning to focus more on the financials and analytics than just having a good time. 

Disclaimer: people can stream for whatever reason they want, I'm not trying to call out people that stream purely for money. I just feel like some people can become discouraged when they don't see high numbers (or any numbers at all!) whether it's viewers, follows, donations etc.. and I just wanted to reinforce that you can stream without any of that and still have fun! Streaming used to be just about sharing content, and having fun gaming. Back when Twitch wasn't even called Twitch yet, those streamers didn't have donation/sub buttons. They just streamed for the enjoyment of either the gameplay, or the social interaction. I don't want people to lose sight of that.

There are so many how-to guides and reflections on here, and while that's great, **do not** feel obligated to conform to them. First and foremost, think about what's going to make you the most happy. At the end of the day, most streamers on Twitch, are not making a living off of it, so don't strain yourself trying to profit off of a hobby. Something sounds like fun? Play it. Oversaturated game/space? So what-do it if it makes you happy. 

I wish everyone the best in whatever your goals as a Twitch content created are, but please don't get bogged down in the numbers-enjoy yourselves! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6ngy32/reminder_you_can_stream_purely_for_streaming/,1500137546.0,165,0.9,41,Twitch,Jinxwinks

6n8cqt,"(Post Follow up) 6 Months of Streaming, what have I learned?","Before you read this post, I recommend going back to my initial post and reading that: https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5vpunb/3_months_of_streaming_what_have_i_learned/

Imagine Twitch as the wild west, with groups of people who support eachother and then the outlaws (trolls) who come to disrupt the peace. As stated in my first post, 3 monhts later, I can say that it's still not a good thing to look at your viewer count. And the points I made prior are still valid;

* You **don't change your attitude** depending on number of people watching.
* You **don't demoralise yourself** if you don't realise you've dropped a viewer or two.

Another thing that I have come to realise of the course of my streaming ""career"" so far is that you have highs and lows in viewership. Recently I've been on the rear end of a huge viewership loss, and I'll be honest, it completely de-moralises you. But something that you need to remember is that no matter what you stream, people will always come and go. 

My simple point is, do not underestimate the challenges that will follow when streaming on Twitch. Streaming is **hard** and I think a lot of people come in to streaming thinking that it will be easy.

I'll list some recommendations (some of them from the recent post) below to help you grow and possibly help with your stream;

**Do's:**

* **Collaborate with streamers a similar size to your channel** and learn from your own and their mistakes. You can really make great friends from streaming, so give everyone a chance! This one is definately still valid after all this time, I've made some amazing friends from streaming, and I'm sure there are more to come! I will also put the **host people after a stream and raid them** point under here, this is important because even if your raid is small, it can mean the world to someone, and also help you grow connections with other channels!

* **Set up a auto-host** function with your friends and fellow streamers that you enjoy watching or play with to help them out, and also help yourself out. If they notice you're doing this for them, they may return the favour. **Edit:** Being honest, don't over-do the whole auto-host feature, you want to auto host your favorite streamers or streamers you want to support, but don't auto host people just because they do the same for you. Although it's a nice gesture, it may mean that people have no chance of seeing your offline screen!

* Be 99% **you**. By this I mean there are things you cannot say on stream and opinions you cannot voice, but always be genuine, humble and most importantly, just be who you are, but slightly toned down. **Edit:** Being you is very important. If you stream, people will learn to know you and then watch for you, and this, is one of the most important things when being a streamer.

* **Get some graphics made for you** before you begin to stream, no one will stay in a stream that has terrible graphics, unless there's something very unique about you that may make them want to stay! There are free sites online, it just takes a short google. But the best stuff you'll probably have to pay for, unless you're a designer yourself. **Edit:** This is still exremely important. Nothing to add.

* **Be Happy!** One of the hardest things about streaming is that you do have to be happy, or at least positive. If you're not enjoying it, don't do it.

* **Schedules are very important** and is for me at least, a must have. Even if you only stream 3 days a week, it's important that people know when and where to find you!

* **Social Media** is your best friend. Use it! I don't think I see enough streamers just starting up using social media as the powerful tool it can be. From networking with other streamers to sharing your schedule and stream, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are three of the most prodiminant ones. I also recommend creating a steam group!

* **Set up some alerts.** Streamlabs.com is one of the best ones. Find something you enjoy, or want to have as a follower alert, make it relate to you and something people will follow to hear again!
* Set up a bot to help moderate your channel, the one I use is Ankhbot. But there are others such as MooBot and NightBot. Tutorials are online which can be found pretty easily!
**Edit:** Since my initial post, I have started using Streamelements for the bot, I would highly recommend trying this out.
* **Discord Servers** are one of the best ways to create a community and maintain it. Along with having a place to chat and post interesting things. As not everyone uses Twitter or Facebook, Discord is an essential part.

* **Clip moments and share them** - This tip was given to me by a Twitch Staff Member and I can say that it helps with recognition and growth. Get your chat to clip moments for you, and if possible share on platforms. If you want to share on your ow




**Don'ts:** 

**Edit: I have left the first three as they were, because they are still valid. No changes made**

* **Don't let trolls get to you.** Everyone gets trolls, if you laugh at them or pay no attention they will get bored and leave.

* **Don't be rude to your viewers**, no one wants a rude broadcaster. These people are taking their time out of their day to watch **you**, remember that. Don't take them for granted, remember they are here to watch you, the streamer is more important than the game 99% of the time.

* **Don't beg for donations/follows/hosts.** This gets you no where. A more friendly way to do this would be to say something along the lines of ""If you're enjoying what you see, consider dropping a follow"".

* **Don't treat streaming like a job, unless it becomes one** - I made this mistake, and it really makes you enjoy streaming less. Do what you want when you stream, play games that you enjoy, and as stated above, be you. 

The same with the previous post, I will do my best to reply to all the comments below, if you have anything to add to the ""Do's and Don'ts"" please let me know and I will edit them.

As always folks, keep your heads high and move forward, you'll do great! 

I wish you all the best of luck!

Anyone else who wants to use it is more than welcome! It's a Quicktime ProRes4444 + Alpha file at 1080p 60fps, so it will hopefully be compatible with a lot of stream setups. OBS loops videos nicely, but you could even use it as a still frame instead if you wanted. Feel free to share too!

6mqigb,Twitch taking action for Net Neutrality,"Twitch has sent out an email detailing the action they're taking in support of Net Neutrality.  
  
If you haven't seen the email it reads as follows:  
  
&gt; Hey Broadcasters,

&gt; On July 12, Twitch, along with other social media sites, will be calling attention to the US Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) decision to repeal Net Neutrality rules. 

&gt; These rules serve as the framework that prevents carriers from abusing their position of power.  For example, certain rules prevent ISPs from giving priority to specific sites over other sites, slowing down access to sites that refuse to pay an ISP for a fast lane, and blocking sites based on the decision of an ISP.  

&gt; We believe that it is important that we not only lend our voice to this issue but educate the community and empower action.  How will we do that: on July 12 all the Twitch global emotes will be replaced with a spinning wheel for 24-hours.

&gt; A banner ad at the top of the channel page will serve as a call to action to users and link them to a page designed by the Internet Association.  From there, one can read more about this topic and send a letter to their respresentiative and the FCC.

&gt; Although this issue is timely in the US, we are aware that it exists in other countries.  We will continue to advocate in ways that support our creators, you.  And, we encourage you to join us and educate us on similar concerns impacting you.

&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Twitch  
  
I look forward to seeing what people think of this!

So, the problem is ""Pause/Wiedergabe"" or for english people ""Pause/Play"" says ""Weltraum"" which in english is ""Space"" of course. But somebody translated it 1:1 in german without looking at it.
""Weltraum"" isn't a key on the keyboard, ""Weltraum"" is the space / universe.

""Space"" would be ""Leertaste"" in german.

6mbs3c,New twitch ipad app has a ton of infuriating problems,"1. Swiping left/right over the twitch chat area has a 50% chance to open/close twitch chat and a 50% chance to switch streams. 

2. Chat covers 1/4 of the stream, so I have to open/close it constantly in order to see the right side of the stream

3. The swipe to swap stream sometimes crashes the app

4.   Impossible to select and copy chat because the ""copy"" icon disappears instantly even when chat isn't moving

5. If you leave the app, then come back later, the app tries to load the twitch chat from a few minutes all at once and it crashes. 

1,2,3 drove me crazy yesterday.  I was watching a dota tournament, a big teamfight was coming up, so I open twitch chat to see the reactions.  But I end up swapping streams and missing everything. This kept happening and made the app almost unusable.

6m99d1,Streamers: Consider not streaming on July 12th in support of Net Neutrality's Day of Action,"Killing Net Neutrality can and will most likely impact US streamers and viewers (as well as foreign streamers with US audiences). Internet Service Providers will have the authority to implement anti-consumer policies, and as history has shown us, will indeed put them into action.

Perhaps Verizon will look at gigabits of data that Twitch viewers in the US alone are using per second to watch their favorite streamers, and decide to throttle that? Maybe Comcast has an issue with Amazon's (who owns Twitch) strong presence and dominance in the cloud and decides to limit its customer's access to what they can and cannot access on Amazon's network.

These are all very real possibilities.

If you don't want to skip a stream, then try and participate and show your support in some other way. And whether you decide to participate or not, please realize how important this is. How fundamental to the future of the internet this really is.

**Edit: Other ways you can help**

I'm surprised at the mostly positive reaction this is getting. I'm also very appreciative of the suggestions mentioned by users. Because a lot of you are wondering about other ways to participate, I'll go over a few ways that you can:

 * Instead of not streaming, **consider decreasing the bitrate and resolution at which you normally would stream**. This was a great idea brought to my attention by /u/LigerXT5. This would closely mimic what a Twitch viewer would experience if an ISP were to enforce limits.
 * **Spread this post** to those you know that are fans of Twitch, its platform, and its community.
 * **Talk about it on stream** and explain it to your viewers. Provide them links and information, and tell them how it could affect their ability to watch you as a content provider / streamer.
 * Powered by battleforthenet.com, you can **opt-in to tweet urgent messages at key moments** toward the build up to July 12th via [this link](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?twitter_modal=1).
 * If you run a website, there is an **open-source widget that displays an alert on the day of action** (not before) to your visitors and presents them an easy to fill out form. That can be found on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget).
 * For those of you producing video content, also provided by battleforthenet.com, is **a short video clip that you can include in your videos** (and possibly periodically during streams) that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7iKho2OIeVzY1FKTlAzS1NOVTg).
 * A comprehensive hive of documentation, graphics, copy/paste messages, and other resources can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3wUF8CCs1g65dmnlxPCmy84WxCTpkzhLENULwubnoI/edit#). It includes how to post about it on Facebook, blog about it, and email about it.

6le2qa,Why I love Twitch...,"I will try not to ramble here but please forgive me if I do.

I have been on Twitch actively since the end of 2014/start of 2015 and got to know many people through watching the same set of streamers for pretty much most of it. My only irl friend was physically disabled so decided to stream towards the end of 2015 so when I wasn't at his house gaming, we could still hang out and he could still watch me play. 

Fast forward to January 2016 and he sadly passed away due to his disability and things haven't been the same without him, either irl or on Twitch. I decided to stop streaming as my reason to stream had gone but I continued to support the many amazing streamers I had found in the year previous and to be able to keep contact with the many online friends I had made now knowing I had no irl friends to visit.

I got close to a few people who talked me into wanting to stream again and I decided to just take the plunge in September 2016 as I had a reason to stream again and people who I liked and respected wanting to watch me. Since restarting streaming I have made so many more genuine friends who I would not hesitate to do anything for. The community spirit has come to recently and with the new features rolling out on the site it has kept it fresh and fun.

I really don't know what I'd have done in the last 18 months or so if it hadn't been to Twitch - because to me it is so much more than about gaming. It's the communities, the funny moments, in jokes and most importantly to me, the genuine friends I have made. I love Twitch because it gives me something to look forward to every single day and I am eternally thankful to everyone who has stopped by and supported my channel and to everyone who has been a friend.

There have been so many 'special moments', too many to list here, but thank you, Twitch, for just being there, and to everyone who has become a genuine friend, I cannot thank you enough :)

6l4fb6,A somewhat small reminder,"I think that every new streamer within the twitch community eventually reaches a fragile state of mind. What I mean by this, is that in the early days of streaming whilst you build a community, you may face good days, bad days, and just... God awful days. All it can take is a few words to absolutely crush somebody after one of these days and entirely demoralise them.

The community of /r/twitch is full of people (that I've experienced, so far) that are willing to offer guidance, in-depth details, comparative data, personal knowledge... It goes on. 
The more I learn here, the more I tend to share back. The more I learn on stream through my own experiences, the same goes. This is replicated by many new streamers here, which I find to be humbling and unexpected.

Remember to stay positive and assist one another. Build connections, communities, host one another, visit one another - Give constructive criticism and improve. 

I've seen plenty of disrespect as of late, with a side of sausage-waving in the faces of the new and effectively vulnerable affiliates. If you are an established streamer, with an audience, be it 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years - Just remember that these people were once in your shoes and you know how that feels. 

I'm new. I have good days and bad days. I keep truckin'. I keep helping out here, as I have been helped. I give what I can, from what I've been given.

6ktbom,Dear Twitch App Devs...,"How much did you pay the Fallout 4 team for development advice?

Note: I use an iPad and the update feels like it was an update meant for an iPhone 4

The new app is like going from Fallout:NV to Fallout 4! Yeah a few things are cool (making clips) BUT YOU'VE REMOVED THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES!

1. Why in the world can I no longer view the stream and chat at the same time in landscape and in portrait why does it cover the screen?!?

2. What is the point in the swiping streams option? I'd view what all the people I'm following are streaming before choosing one not just swiping blindly then being stuck on an ad. ALL IT DOES IS MAKE ME ACCIDENTALLY GO OFF A STREAM I WANT TO WATCH!

3. Things such as the on screen volume have gone, Why?

4. Why have you cluttered everything into 3 tabs? 

5. Changing the format of the followed channels is really bad, the thumbnails are now tiny and 50% of the screen is now just purple. The old one was SOOOOO much better. (The 'live' tab should look like the when you view streams playing a certain game)

6. Why have you removed the picture in picture button? (I know I have to now go full screen and press the home button)

7. The new 'fade in' &amp; other animations in general make the whole app feel slow and unresponsive.

8. The screen significantly darkening while the options are up is just annoying.

9. A lot of the buttons feel hit and miss.

10. The paste, copy and select options disappearing when someone says something in the chat issue hasn't been fixed yet.

11. Why does options and share now cover a huge portion of the screen for no reason (look at the old version)

Overall this 'update' seems like a massive downgrade! I would be so much happier (and I'm sure most people would agree) if I could just use the older version!

EDIT: 12. Apparently Airplay/chrome casting is broken, you can find the comment below.

EDIT: 13. u/brahbocop has noticed ads appearing on subscribed streams.

EDIT: I just wanted to add a little foot note. I know app development is hard, but update which removes features is unexcusable especially when we're paying them (subscribing,

6kilxo,The Microphone Myth: What it takes to get the best audio on Twitch.,"Hi there! I'm KickedTripod, you may have seen me around here answering questions (mostly about audio setups, OBS settings, and occasional ""mindset"" questions). I'm a full-time podcaster first and I love the Twitch community and try to give back wherever I can.  

&amp;nbsp;


**So why are you making this thread?** Almost every day, this subreddit is flooded with questions about audio setups. ""I got a new microphone, but now I have hum."" ""Which microphone should I get?"" I'd like to answer this here, start a great discussion about your best practices, and hopefully create a space where we can learn together.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Microphone Myth:** Your favorite streamer, podcaster, or YouTuber probably has an amazing microphone. You watch them day in and day out with their smooth vocals and say, ""I want that too!"" So, as most of us did, we went out and bought a nice $100+ microphone, got home, plugged it in, and realized that wasn't the entire issue. There's something *more* that we aren't seeing or hearing. *This is the microphone myth.* Now before I go any further, I want to acknowledge ahead of time that this isn't always the case. Some have thoroughly done their research; Others have all the right programs they need to make their audio work; some even have perfectly treated rooms. That's fine. I'm not here to tell you to spend more money. I'm not here to say you need more than you think you need. However, I would like to be a cautioning voice that at least asks, ""Do you **ALL** have the right stuff?"" In short, your mileage may vary.

&amp;nbsp;

**What does it take to get excellent audio on Twitch?** There are four major components to making your voice sound awesome on Twitch: your microphone, your room, your effects, and your voice. Three first three components you have major control over, the fourth one you don't and making any major changes to your voice can take months of vocal practice. **Before you do anything, assess your budget. If you have $200 to spend, know that up front.** Let's discuss each of these:  
**Your Microphone:** The first thing people tend to recommend when you want to make your voice sound better is to get a nice microphone (Hello, Blue Yeti!). **Don't underestimate headset microphones.** With most headset microphones, you have little-to-no background noise, don't need any additional acoustic treatment, and you don't have to worry about boom arms and the like. Summit1G uses a headset microphone and it's perfectly adequate, out of the way, and low maintenance. This might be the best route for you. If you've determined you want to go to the next level, read on.  
Finding your first microphone can be overwhelming--especially if you don't have any experience with audio. USB, XLR, Dynamic, Condenser, Omni, bidirectional, cardoid-- it can get overwhelming quickly.  
Many here will correctly recommend a USB microphone in most situations. They're generally cheaper than similar XLR microphones, don't require extra cables or audio interfaces, and some are even advertised as livestreaming microphones. Don't worry, I'm happy to make any microphone recommendations for those who'd want it. The ONLY drawback to USB microphones are that there's little to upgrade or add. For livestreaming purposes, this is generally fine and you can find a USB microphone to work right for you.  
XLR requires an audio interface to convert the analog signal to digital. *Please don't get a $10 adapter off of Amazon that takes an XLR straight to USB* They're finicky, often noisy, and they definitely aren't helping your sound. There are tons of audio interfaces (and soundboards) that run in the $80-$150 range that work great for livestreaming. In my experience, I've found a $60 broadcast XLR microphone into a decent $100 interface sound just as good if not better than a standalone USB microphone. This is generally speaking of course and exceptions absolutely apply. The point I'm trying to make is, don't be afraid to get a less expensive (well rated and recommended) XLR microphone and interface instead of a more expensive USB microphone.  
Condenser vs. Broadcast(Dynamic). Speaking generally, Broadcast (or Dynamic) microphones are more directional, pick up less room noise, and are overall easier to treat. It is important to note that Dynamic and Broadcast microphones aren't ALWAYS the same, but they're used so interchangeably, I thought it worthy of note. Condenser microphones, on the other hand, generally pick up more noise and can sometimes have a larger range (potentially giving you better bass frequencies or more sparkly highs in your voice). Broadcast microphones are an easy recommendation for livestreaming because of their inherent features, but Condenser is often used as well. Those Blue Yeti's? Condenser. AT2020? Condenser. AT2100? Broadcast. All popular mics. All highly recommended and rated. On top of a microphone you'll want a popfilter, boom arm, and shock mount (altogether an investment of about $50). I prefer a pop filter that goes over my microphone rather than a windscreen that goes in front (the big round black ones that need to be mounted separately).

&amp;nbsp;

**Your Room:** We've laid a foundation for microphones. What microphone you get should largely depend on your room. Hardwood floors, angled ceilings, hollow walls, and hollow desks means that you're going to deal with a lot of additional noise that will be difficult to get out with even with effects and proper microphone technique. You'll be forced to do a combination of two things: 1. get an insensitive mic with a low noise floor or 2. acoustically treat your room. In an ideal world, you choose both. To acoustically treat an ENTIRE room, it can cost near $150. Exceptions apply - you may decide to only do some treatment (bass traps and foam panels in front and behind you in alternating patterns), you may do some DIY treating with blankets, packing foam, etc. But, to go to Amazon and treat a 12x12 room well enough to a point where we've removed most of those echoes generally costs about $150 in my experience - and makes a huge difference. Hollow desk? Get a huge, soft, mousepad. I have the largest Glorious and SteelSeries mouse pads that cover most of my desk space. That way I can get away with cheap $30 IKEA desktops. Hanging blankets over windows, ruffling them in corners, also helps. I've even draped cloth from my ceiling. Besides these DIY improvements, I can't personally speak to their effectiveness.

&amp;nbsp;

**Effects.** I could seriously write a book about effects. However, I'll keep it REALLY simple: Denoiser, EQ, Gate, Compression. To livestream, I have 3 computers. One is dedicated only to the effects I put on my microphone. Don't worry, you don't have to do that. I've used 1, 2, and 3 computer audio setups. For beginners using OBS Studio, you're in luck! OBS Studio supports VST plugins. What's VST? VST stands for **Virtual Studio Technology.** In short, it's the audio plugins professionals and amateurs alike use to add effects to their audio recordings. What that means is that you can send your microphone into OBS, add the effects, and go straight into the streams with no extra pieces of hardware or software necessary! The upside? Ease of use. Simple. The downside? A little tedious to set up. You can't know well how you sound until you've set everything up, do a quick 5sec recording, and make adjustments again. It's tedious. Another option you have is using *software routing* to run your microphone through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Adobe Audition, Pro Tools, or Reaper. This gives you access to ""monitoring"" which will let you hear how your microphone sounds in real time. I'll talk about why this may be important in part 4. To use these programs as an input into your livestreaming program, you'll need a program like Virtual Audio Cables (ugh) or VoiceMeter Banana (less ugh, but still ugh). Software audio routing will introduce latency, potential degradation in quality, and can sometimes be a bit finicky. Again, YMMV. With a two or 3 computer setup, you can set up hardware audio routing, but that's getting a little intense and this post is getting long.  
A **denoiser** is designed to reduce or remove your noise floor. OBS Studio has one stock called a Noise Suppressor. It's good. Use it. Don't overuse it. Do this FIRST in your chain.  
Second in your effects chain use an **EQ (Equalizer)** this is where you can boost your bass, cut your high frequencies, or do whatever else you want to make your voice sound great. I love the sound of bass in my voice and probably have added too much of it on my Twitch - if you're newer, add 20% less bass than you think sounds best. There's a good chance you've set it too high.  
Third, I use a **Noise Gate.** A compressor is generally used to eliminate variances between the loudest and quietest portions of your voice. If you add a gate afterwards, you'll not cut out enough or cut out too much. A noise gate is exactly what it sounds like, it mutes your microphone when the noise is below a certain threshold and ""opens the gate"" when your voice goes above it. I recommend low attacks and releases here, but you'll just have to play around with it.  
Lastly, a **compressor.** A compressor reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest portions of your voice. At least, that's the most generic one sentence definition I can give it. The main features of a compressor is the compression ratio. Unless you know what you're doing, never go over a 4:1 ratio (as a best practice). Play around with the rest.

&amp;nbsp;

**Your Voice:** There's a myth out there that to get a great sounding tone from your voice that you need to have the right voice for it. You don't. To be a professional voice actor, sure. To be that guy in movie trailers? Absolutely. But to have a pleasant sounding voice on Twitch you just need a decent microphone, a basically treated room, a few basic effects to bring out the best parts of your voice while minimizing the worst parts, and a little microphone technique. I'm told ALL THE TIME that my voice sounds amazing, I sound like I'm in commercials, etc. It happens so much that my Twitch community spams ""KTnicemic"" in chat whenever someone comments on it in game. Speak to me in real life, you'd never think there's anything special about it. So here are a few of my tips: First, the closer you can get to your microphone, the warmer your voice will be. If you go further than 5-6 inches away from the microphone and don't have an amazing microphone setup with great sound treatment, you're going to reintroduce echo by turning up the gain too high. Second, if you can, use real-time monitoring of your voice post-effects. Hearing how you sound can help you FIX poor technique, intonations, etc. You'll learn when to lean off the microphone when you yell or are using plosive sounds, and when to lean in close.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion:** WOOFTA. I didn't expect to write this long. But, it illustrates my point: just a microphone is normally not enough. Invest a little bit extra into these other topics and you'll differentiate your stream with the audio quality. Please feel free to like and discuss. I'm also available if you might have any questions!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit 1: Like a bonehead a I misused cardoid when I meant condenser. Fixed!  
Edit 2: I expected this, but there are a LOT of people coming in and doing exactly what I was trying to avoid: recommending microphones as THE solution to your audio problems and overcomplicating this post. This is not the ONLY way to do things. Some people will live and die by hardware routing, complicated signal chains, extra steps. **My goal was to give ANY Twitch user a base to begin thinking about their audio, where to start, and general rules of thumb that took some of us years to know and understand.

Thank you so much for your support and interest! I'm doing my best to keep everything running smoothly, but if you run into any hiccups just try to refresh the page or PM me on here. Thanks, again everyone! Ya'll are incredible. :)

Hey guys/gals! So I've been staying up to date with the issues and concerns that everyone in this sub has been bringing up over the past couple of months, and I think I've built a tool that can help solve **a lot** of those problems for all of you. We call it **[Streamer Insights](https://streamerinsights.com/landing.html)**, and I am super happy to finally be *officially* announcing it to you all - with the approval of this sub's mod team! :)

Firstly, the problems/questions I've noticed being the most prevalent (aside from technical issues) posted here that I think my platform can help you fix:

* What game(s) should I play?

* How do I get viewers?

* How do I keep viewers?

* How do I get subscribers? (congrats, affiliates!)

* How can I become a successful broadcaster?

These are the biggest issues that I've built my platform to address. 

It is built around an artificial intelligence that gathers, analyzes, and processes *everything* about your channel/community. And we then show you that data in **an easily understandable** format. One of the biggest concerns from broadcasters I would see for other analytics tools currently available is that it's just a bunch of raw numbers, and what we've done is stripped out all the data science and are doing our best to provide broadcasters with actionable insights/data points - so you don't need to be a data scientist to understand what is actually helpful to you. Now (if you consider yourself a tiny streamer), you may think that a channel with &lt;10 viewers wouldn't have that much data to process, but as it turns out, there are **thousands** of data points that no other analytics platform is tapping in to right now that can be used to make more educated decisions about how to grow your channel. 

So before I explain the metrics that we track, I have to explain **[our philosophy](https://streamerinsights.com/faq.html)**. It all revolves around getting *you* to understand that your viewer count is arguably the **least** valuable metric for helping you understand how to grow your channel. It is a reactionary metric and all you can do with your viewer count is say ""I had *x* number of viewers during *y* game so I'm doing great/terrible!"" There is merit to using your viewer count as a tool for getting more exposure, however, but we'll get in to that later. So, at least for the duration of this post, remove your viewer count from your mind as being valuable to your growth - and I'll explain what metric *is* the most valuable. 

A broadcaster's **community** is the most influential piece of building a successful channel. Whether you have 10 viewers or 10,000 viewers, those that form your regulars, subscribers, moderators, subscribers, cheerers, friends, etc. are the reasons that you will succeed or fail as a broadcaster. There are hundreds of tricks you can perform, jokes you can make, games you can play, but if your personality and your content is not capable of cultivating a community then you will struggle in growing your channel *tremendously* more so than someone who does. 

With that being said, out of all of the metrics and data points my platform processes, they are all culminated into *six* that can help you much more easily understand your **community's** growth and how it ebbs and flows. Those six are as follows, but you can get more info by looking at our **[faq](https://streamerinsights.com/landing.html)**:

* 1). Your number of **engaged** viewers - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

* 2). Your viewer's **average time watched** - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

* 3). How **receptive** your viewers are to your content - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

* 4). Your number of **new visitors** - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

* 5). Your number of **potential subscribers** (for partners and affiliates) - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

* 6). Your number of **potential cheerers** - over time, per game, and compared against channels similar to yours

We take these metrics, and display them in two formats:

* The first: a dashboard for understanding your community's patterns and trends over the past week, or over the past games you've played

* The second: a **live** dashboard, for you to use as an auxiliary chat. It notifies you when your community is more engaged than normal so you know when you're doing something right, and it also ranks all of your chatters by who you **should** be engaging with in order to get them more involved with your community (it is an invaluable tool for growing your channel every day)

We just ended our closed beta a few weeks ago with several hundred participating channels, and while we still have a lot of work to do, I wanted to finally release **[Streamer Insights](https://streamerinsights.com/landing.html)** into *open* beta so everyone could try it out and let me know what they think about it. Full disclosure, due to how much data has to be processed, this service is *not* free - but it is cheap, and there is a free trial to try it out (so hopefully that won't dissuade you).

So with that being said, I could go into **a ton** more detail about all the different ways I think Streamer Insights can help you grow your channel - but I would rather you just **[see for yourself](https://streamerinsights.com/landing.html)** the impact it can have, and *you* can decide if it brings value to your channel or not. An added note: it takes a few days to start processing all of the data from your channel, so we will let you know as soon as your reports are ready! You can typically start looking at your **[Game Trends](https://streamerinsights.com/gameTrends.html)** within a day or two, however!

As much as I would love to get more broadcasters working with Streamer Insights, feedback is equally as important. So I will do my best to respond to as many comments as I am able. 

Good luck on your streaming journey! And I am happy to help if you need me. And **congratulations, affiliates**! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6k1kfg/i_built_a_service_that_can_actually_help_you_grow/,1498666226.0,182,0.91,104,Twitch,StreamerInsights
6k0yn7,Why Twitch Partners need to stop complaining about Affiliate Sub buttons (From a Viewer's perspective),"To start off, let us just acknowledge I am neither a Twith Partner or Affiliate, but generally a viewer.  I can see both sides of the argument revolving around sub buttons for twitch affiliates.
I understand that yes, by affiliates having a sub button, the separation from partner to affiliate is now minimal when it comes to functionality, and I can sympathize.  You put in a lot of work, you got to partner, and now a bunch of people below your level are getting most of the same benefits as you.  Seems unfair right?  Well, not exactly.  Let us consider a few things.

EDIT:  The difference between Partner and Affiliate I should not say is 'minimal' but yes, the gap has closed a little.  But clearly not even as much as I had thought, as I am not fully knowledgeable about what all benefits are received from either party.  However, that only strengthens my argument :)

DJTruthsayer is a partner that put it best by saying the biggest downfall to affiliate sub buttons is that he won’t be able to afford to sub to all the affiliates he wants to support.  That is the true attitude of a quality twitch partner who recognizes that the community is important.  I know many of you partners are happy for the affiliates, and to you guys, my hat goes off to you and this is not directed towards you, as I am sure you know.  


Anyway, to my primary points:


In the business world, you will always get competition.  What does that mean?  You simply need to keep up your game and the quality of your content etc.  You aren’t going to lose subs to the affiliates unless the affiliates are actually better than you.  So if you are afraid that affiliate subs is going to HURT your brand, then maybe that’s because you need to actually improve your own content.  Affiliates aren’t going to “steal” your subs or viewers.  If they were going to, they’d have your viewers already.


Secondly, affiliates getting sub buttons is an opportunity for ALL of twitch to grow.  Twitch is a growing entity, and many people want to support the people they watch but are limited in their ways to do so simply because their favorite streamer isn’t partnered yet.  These people don’t come running up to partners to throw away money because they can’t sub to their affiliate streamer.  So again, you aren’t losing people but giving more viewers a desire to stay and support their favorite content creators, which in turn causes twitch to grow.
Another point is that most of the largest partners out there had it a lot easier than new streamers joining in.  Partner requirements have only gotten harder as twitch has grown because they don’t want to over saturate the market.  It could be argued that it is actually harder for a streamer today to make partner than it was a few years ago, so saying that you worked so hard to earn your partner and now some smaller streamers are going to get YOUR perks is ridiculous because MOST smaller streamers that would actually receive subs work just as hard as you do, if not harder.  I know MANY affiliate streamers who put out high quality content, and bust their backs trying to grow their communities on twitch and who easily have the numbers to have made partner a couple years ago but can’t break through now.  


The fact as, as industries grow, more people come into it, which in turn changes the dynamic.  Twitch recognizes that it needs to help the smaller streamers who are more easily lost in the sea of the streaming world today grow because that is the ONLY way for Twitch itself to continue to grow.  Furthermore, competitive markets in other streaming sites with benefits for all streamers of all sizes means twitch also needs to keep up with changing demands in the industry. 

 
So, while I understand where your frustration may come from, you all need to remember where you came from, how you started and how it felt when you never imagined making partner.  Everyone has been there, and the affiliates of today are working every bit as hard as you, and frankly, in my opinion, probably even harder.  You were first and yes, you grew the industry, but that’s what pioneering anything does.  The first people to do anything always pave the way for those who follow and things change.  I bowled in college, and there were almost no scholarship opportunities to do so as most schools had it as a club sport and we had to fundraise for all of our expenses on our own time.  But due to my generation’s growing of the sport, colleges all across the U.S. now offer scholarship opportunities for the sport as well as actually fund their teams.  That’s how life works, so, sorry partners, but in the end, you need to get off your high horse and realize that’s how things work.  At least you can continue doing what you do and still benefit.  


Pioneers pave the way for those to follow in their footsteps and Twitch partners are just starting to learn this.  While growing the industry, things are going to change and many opportunities will arise for the newcomers that you didn’t have, but it is not in spite of you, but rather BECAUSE of you.

6jvpuz,[Rant] I am disappointed by seeing how many partnered streamers seem to be offended/upset about affiliates getting sub buttons.,"I just have a few things to say:

1. A sub button does NOT equal subs, viewers, followers, an income. Button or not, if a person wants to make a real following/money off of streaming, they will need to put in that work. How much sheer luck went into some partnered-streamer's careers? I can say with certainty that there are affiliates busting their asses just as hard, if not harder than some partnered streamers. 

2. ""It's so *easy* now"". You could argue that it's easier to get a sub button, but how much harder is it to be a partner now? I can guarantee that the requirements for partner have raised over the years.

3. Why do you stream? Is it because you have fun playing games? Maybe you like having people in your chat? Maybe it's to make money, if you're lucky enough to get there. If you said yes to those, then I see no reason except for lack of empathy and an inflated sense of ego, to NOT support your fellow streamers and be happy for them. If you are able to build and grow a following, nobody is going to ""steal"" that from you.

Good luck and have fun my fellow Twitch users (: **I** am happy for you. 

Edit: I've realized that I may have been looking in a more anti-affiliate environment (the comment section of Twitch's Twitter) than the overall community sentiment. I didn't mean to paint all, or the majority of partners as anti-affiliate and so I apologize if I generalized! At the end of the day, if the majority of the community is supportive then that's all we can really ask for, I just wanted to speak out for the ""little guys"" a little bit (:",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6jvpuz/rant_i_am_disappointed_by_seeing_how_many/,1498597075.0,131,0.83,141,Twitch,Jinxwinks

*""For streamers, subscriptions are an important tool to help grow their community and build steady income from their channel. For viewers, subscribing is a rite of passage. When you find that community you can really connect with and a streamer that makes you feel welcome, it’s the natural next step to subscribe and help sustain that community if you are able to. Once you do, you’ve got sub emotes in common with a circle of friends that share the same inside jokes. Subscribing signals to the rest of the community that you are there to stay and makes you part of the streamer’s inner circle. And now you can be one of the first to subscribe to an Affiliate starting this week!""*


*""Affiliates will have access to all subscription options: $4.99, $9.99 and $24.99/month, as well as the Twitch Prime free subscription. They’ll have one sub emote for all subscribers, and two additional slots for $9.99 and $24.99 subs. And just like Partners, Affiliates will be able to offer sub-only chat.
Many Twitch Partners can remember with crystal clarity the first time someone subscribed to them. They talk about how humbled they were that someone was willing to step up and offer ongoing support. Today we congratulate all the Twitch Affiliates who will now have the opportunity to forge those lasting connections with their new subscribers.""*

**Burning Questions:**


**Q. Do Affiliates get Sub Badges?** 

*A. They do get the standard Twitch sub badge, but not the ability to upload custom badges.*

**Q. I’m an Affiliate. How do I upload my sub emote(s)?**

*A. As soon as your Sub button appears this week, you can upload your emote(s). Go to the Settings tab in your Dashboard, click Emoticons, then Edit, and upload your emoticon in the sizes specified, and then click Save Changes. You can find more details about sub emotes here.*

**Q. How long will it take for my sub emote(s) to be approved?**

*A. Review of Affiliate emotes can take up to a week or more, and there may be delays as we work through all the new emotes from tens of thousands of Affiliates. This process cannot be expedited (attempting to do so may, in reality, slow the process down). As well, events and holidays may extend the approval process, so please be patient while waiting for review.*

**Q. What is my Sub Emote Prefix?**

*A. It will be auto-selected for you based on your Twitch username. You will find it on the emoticon upload page from the Settings tab in your Dashboard.*

**Q. Can I change my Sub Emote prefix?**

*A. We are not allowing changes to Affiliate sub emote prefixes at this time.*

**Q. When is Subscription gifting launching?**

*A. We’re working hard to deliver this feature as soon as we can!*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6jux6s/twitch_blog_subscriptions_for_affiliates_coming/,1498590178.0,213,0.94,225,Twitch,Artamor

6jg8lg,I have a much better highlight system idea for twitch,"the new highlight system would be more like soundcloud system
where you have the comments in the timeline 


you will be watching a twitch stream and you would have a ""funny"" button below the stream and maybe ""highlight"" button 

then you press it in real time while watching 
the system will register all the people clicking those buttons in real time and at the end of the stream you could load the vod and see the timeline with all the highlights showing across the video the more people who clicked the ""funny/highlight"" button at a certain point of the stream it will show a higher graph curve on the timeline same as soundcloud audio visual display 

then you could just skip in the vod according to the graph curve skipping to funny bits on the fly 

or skipping to sad bits the graph could have multiple lines/layers each representing its own thing 

you could even have an algorithm that just skips to the funny parts for you inside a vod 

you would load a 6 hour stream of some guy playing GTA V RP 
and choose play funny bits and the vod would skip from one funny moment to the other according to the curve that was built by people watching real time 

currently i just need to load those 6 hour vod streams and skip manually in hope i find the funny bits without missing them ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6jg8lg/i_have_a_much_better_highlight_system_idea_for/,1498419167.0,51,0.92,12,Twitch,Eladtzvi

But then we also did some 1v1s, 2v2s where I spectated and pretended to be a professional caster! It was so much fun and viewers loved playing against each other and having their games commentated!

6ivfz7,TwitchSwitch - A website that allows you to find random Twitch streams.,"I've created a website called **[TwitchSwitch](http://twitchswitch.tv)** that allows users to find random Twitch streams. The purpose is to help users discover new streamers and games.  
  
**How does it work?**  
When you first launch the site, you will be shown a random stream from Twitch. If you don't like it, you can click Switch to be shown a new random stream. If you log into the site, you can also follow or chat with any streamers you come across!  
  
Do you want to just sit back and relax? Well you can with our auto switch feature! Just click the auto switch button and you will be shown a new stream every 45 seconds. Have a favorite game? Just type it into the game filter and you will be shown random streams for only that game. If you want to watch streams in another language, just choose your preferred language from the drop down!  
  
**How can I get my stream on TwitchSwitch?**  
As long as you are live on Twitch and have at least 3 viewers, you can be found on TwitchSwitch. You do not need to login to our site to show up.  
  
**Idea behind TwitchSwitch:**  
I enjoyed using Discover on Twitch to find random streams but I felt like I was still making the decision to click on the stream based on the thumbnail, title or viewer count. I decided to create this site to take away those decisions and put a streamer in front of you. You actually get to experience the streamer first hand before making the decision to stay or find another. I want people to branch out and find other streamers on Twitch. Of course we all have our favorites, but there are some awesome streamers out there that you may not have ever seen.  
  
If you have any questions or have feedback, feel free to post a comment below. I will do my best to answer them all.

6io4vv,"I just got my first followers since forever, and I'm so happy about it.","Some backstory; I've been Twitching for just over a year. Started back in May of 2016 - every Monday, Wednesday and Sunday nights - with some of my favourite games; Dirty Bomb, Witcher 3, DoTT. Nothing big, nothing flashy or fancy, and I was having a blast.

Managed to get a small following, but not many active viewers - some regulars, whom I am eternally grateful for, but the majority of people I've not seen hide nor hair of since then.

Around July '16, my grandparents were in a car crash. Shortly afterwards, my Grandmother passed away suddenly. All streaming stopped. No energy, couldn't cope, could barely smile either. Complete handbrake on the progress I'd made up until then.

In December I started getting back into streaming, but only for very short periods. Hour, hour and a half tops. No new followers, and 90% of my regulars didn't turn up. I was doing it for me, mostly, to get back to what I was feeling before July.

In February of this year my step-father developed Pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU where he developed sepsis. Streaming was again put on hold as I had to help my mother out. Plus, things were not looking good at all.

Thankfully, he pulled through and was released at the end of May. Since the start of this month, I've been streaming again (no further calamities anticipated!). Small streams, about two hours long, with PUBattlegrounds, Witcher 3, Dirty Bomb or ESO. Earlier in the month I got my first follower since July last year. Today, I got another. It feels awesome.

These two amazing people found me entertaining enough; the first has been watching every stream I've done this month and been engaging me in chat too. It's just bloody awesome.

This super small thing has given me the confidence to keep on streaming, to push myself further. Heck, I even went and got a new greenscreen so I could get myself on webcam again. I have an audience, one that I am smiling to.

You two know who you are. If you read this, thank you guys so much for pressing that button. It's done so much.

If you're in the situation I was in, don't give up. Don't feel down. Soldier on. It's really worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6io4vv/i_just_got_my_first_followers_since_forever_and/,1498073068.0,57,0.74,15,Twitch,Andarne

6iedob,"the LESS I worried, the MORE I enjoyed streaming","*First off, this is coming from a relatively new, casual streamer. So for those looking to make money off Twitch and/or become partner, this thread is not relevant to you. :P*    
    
There's something very troublesome that bothers me when browsing through r/Twitch: many new, small streamers are too scared to try new things. My question is: why? Use this opportunity to explore, experiment, invent, and find yourself as a streamer.    
    
While seeing numbers increase over time feels very rewarding, you should not be worrying over it. Your main focus should be finding out your place in Twitch: who are you. why should people watch you. what makes you different than other streamers. how will people remember you.    
    
I used to be a single-game streamer and got burnt out, so I switched to variety streaming and it felt liberating. Aside from just streaming different games across different genres, I dabbled in workout streams, drawing, digital art, voice acting, motivational speaking, standup comedy, IRL, cooking, and even social eating (which I am not proud of lol). It didn't feel like streaming to me, it felt like a journey of finding what makes streaming enjoyable and discovering what I can offer to people.     
    
Streaming became less of a way of entertainment, and more of a platform to express yourself through artistic freedom. Obviously I adhered to Twitch's ToS, but exploring the categories of twitch allowed me to explore who I am as a streamer while meeting wonderful people along the way.     
    
Bottom line: don't be scared to try something new. You are at a stage where it won't drastically effect you. Use this time to not just grow a channel, but grow yourself as a streamer. This isn't an ""end-all"" way of thinking, but just a different perspective than what I usually see on this subreddit. This place is a great resource for advice, networking, and help, but don't be afraid to go off on your own first. I feel the most common question here is ""What game should I play to grow?"" There's wayyy too many factors to answer that question. Half the fun is finding that out yourself. You will go through successes and hit many walls, but that only benefits you moving forward. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, learn from them.    
    
**EDIT:** I think some people may get the wrong intention of my post. I'm not saying ""try to stream something else"", I'm just saying ""try"" what you're questioning/curious about and experience it first hand. For example: ""Should I stream with my wife?"" ""I want to stream myself playing lacrosse, would anyone even watch?"" ""What is your opinion on using a donation goal?"" ...Why not try?

If we want to follow someone, again we [dont need a reminder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5lht8c/is_there_a_way_to_disable_follow_reminders/)

**Individual regional support:**    

What I mean by this is quite simple. If I'm watching Twitch.tv in Russia, my twitch.tv language settings are set to Russian, and I'm tuning in to the front page of twitch.tv, I want to see someone from my region speaking Russian on the front page or a Russian-language tournament stream. I don't want to see     destiny or itmejp or sirscoots, because as cool as those guys are I can't really understand the words coming out of their mouths. TL;DR here - Most people don't learn a different language.

EDIT: For refinement, it's now 7:55 in the morning Taiwan time. **[This is what I see right now on twitch front page with language switched to Chinese](http://imgur.com/ZwJYlBP)** and in my experience, I literally could have requested Twitch front page for my region from 5:30 in the morning to 8:30 in the morning for my region and I would have been declined. I, again, hold no beef with any of those streamers, but they literally do nothing to contribute to my region's twitch audience when I could be.

**[Doing something about blatant and obvious viewbotters:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6dtv0t/why_does_twitch_ignore_obvious_botting/)**
The obvious thing to do would be to immediately delete whatever accounts were simultaneously created from the same I.P. Address within the same 60 seconds to 60 minutes with zero chat activity. If any authentic accounts were created in that time frame, they could simply recreate the account with some sort of SMS / Email Captcha code verification process.    


**Staff that care about the partner(s) of each region as opposed to what lord Amazon cares about:**    
Again this takes us back to something as simple as increasing communication between streamers and/or staff instead of creating the vacuum of an old boys club of streamers.

**Clearly defined rule-breaking and permabannable offenses on stream.**
So, streamer A said that streamer B sexually assaulted some girl on Twitter, then streamer B says Streamer A slept with an underage girl on stream instead of just tweeting it, and streamer B is dealt with a permaban. Streamer C gets swatted on a plane, makes national headlines on CNN, ABC news, Fox News, and even my mother's blog and then when he steps off the plane he makes the remark ""I am at _________. I probably shouldn't have said that, ya know. Shouldn't enable that kind of toxic behavior. Come on, what's the worst you could do.""

**Return twitch to the level of decency it was at back in 2015**    
Twitch is not an alternative or a substitute to adult-content websites and should not be encouraged as such. This is eventually going to backfire and hurt Twitch just as much as a swatting prank on an airplane that made national headlines.

That is all I can think of guys, if you have any suggestions, throw them at this below and I'll add them to the O.P. if they gain enough traction.

6i93pr,How to Write Great Proposal Emails for Your Twitch Sponsorships,"Hey all! 

This is Aaron again, and I'm back with some more Twitch sponsorship info for you guys. 

So a lot of you are probably interested in picking up sponsorships for your Twitch channels, but aren't sure exactly how to do it. 

Unfortunately, there are a ton of different factors that go into achieving a Twitch sponsorship. If you're a giant streamer, sometimes they just come to you out of nowhere. But if you don't have the audience size of a football stadium, the process is quite unclear. 

But, if there is one thing that I know about attaining sponsorships on twitch with a modest viewer count, it's that you have to send a killer proposal message to the brand.

A proposal message is usually your first email contact with someone at a brand who has the authority to approve your sponsorship request. It usually details who you are (a breif detail of your stream), why you think you'd be a good fit to be sponsored by them, how you can help them achieve your goals, etc. 

Now, if you don't have any experience in business writing, there's a good chance that you won't know how to send an effective proposal email. And trust me, **it's a bad idea to send a proposal email if you don't know what you're doing.** 

So let's change that. 

....But before I get into some of the in's and out's of sending a proposal email that will knock the socks off of any sponsorship manager who reads it, you've gotta know what's going to make you look bad in your proposal email. (In other words, what not to do.) 

After talking with a few companies that manage sponsorships for Twitch streamers, here are the most important things that you need to make sure you stay away from when getting in contact with a company about a sponsorship:

1. Don't CC other companies in your proposal email. 
2. Don't lie to a company and tell them you've used or love their products if you dont. 
3. Don't be too professional. Show some personality! 
4. Don't tell the brand, ""how much it would mean to you"" if you were sponsored by them. 
5. Don't be vague on the type of sponsorship you want to get (Do you want a monthly deal? And affiliate deal?)
6. And lastly, don't ask for a sponsorship the company can't provide. If you want to get sponsored by Monster, they aren't going to start you off with a minifridge. 
7. [EDIT] From /u/StreamerInsights : NEVER lie to a company about your stream's statistics. ""Whomever you're communicating with will quickly be able to tell if you are being forthcoming, and you risk burning professional bridges by not being 100% straightforward about your numbers and community engagement. Sponsors will absolutely do their research on a prospect's channel, social media, and other mediums they are active on.""

Phew. Ok, I'm done with the negatives. 

Now, let's focus on some of the things you absolutely *need* to include in your proposal email. 

# First off, make it immediately apparent that you're looking to be sponsored. 

Don't waste the other person's time; just get right to the point. 

# Secondly, it's important to identify the marketing objectives a brand has. 

Answer this question:

“Why would a brand want to sponsor you as a streamer?”

The reason is, they’re interested in partnering with you to achieve their marketing goals and establish a working business relationship with someone in the gaming space.

It’s important to know what marketing goals a brand is trying to achieve, because it not only shows them that you’ve done research on their company, but also shows that you understand where they are coming from and can help them move in the right direction.

The company might be trying to reach a gamer audience, sell a product, or something similar. What you need to do is find these things out for yourself. To do this, you can study their social media accounts (are they quirky? Or are they serious, etc), watch some of their advertisements, or something similar. 

# Once you have a good understanding of what direction a brand is trying to head in, you're ready to detail how your stream can help the brand reach their marketing goals. 

This is the most important part of your proposal. Think for a second. What makes your stream great? And on top of that, how can those aspects help the brand get where they want to be?

You might have a strong community. This is great for companies who have products that are built on interaction. Or, you might have a decent amount of engaged viewers. This is great for smaller companies looking to get a bit of traction in the gaming space. 

Be sure to do a ton of introspection on your own Twitch channel to find out what makes you worthwhile. If you're not sure why you'd be a good fit for a company, you can try asking those who watch your stream. They usually have a good understanding of what makes them come back day after day.

If you still can't find out why you'd be a good sponsorship fit, it's probably not the best idea to start searching for sponsorship opportunities. Wait a bit just to figure out your stream a bit more, and come back later when you're ready. 

...

And that's it for now! 

I hope this cleared some things up about sending proposals and getting sponsored on Twitch. 

If you'd like, I actually wrote an article where I give a few extra details on how you can better your proposals, as well as an awesome pre-written proposal example to get you on the right path if you're still a bit confused.

6i6nbl,"I would rather you not follow me at all, than follow me and expect a follow back.","I'm on mobile so sorry for any mistakes. 

Please don't come into my stream and say ""Hey, I followed. I would appreciate a follow back, I'm trying to get to 30 followers."" This is a guaranteed way to make sure I never look at your channel. 

I would still consider myself a small channel (~450 followers) but I've earned all of my follows fairly and I'm proud of that. 
I understand you might set yourself follower goals and if you're new to streaming getting yourself set and getting those first few follows is tough, I get that, we've all been there. But coming in to other peoples streams and following them, expecting a follow back is no way to start off.

Firstly. If they do happen to follow back it will most likely be a sympathy follow. They'll hit follow and never watch a single one of your streams. Yeah it's nice to have a bigger follower number but if those people have no intention of watching you  they may as well have not even hit the button in the first place.

Secondly. Asking for follows can make you look desperate/disingenuine. You're turning yourself off to every other person that may be in chat.
Be yourself, start conversations, try to be nice and make friends. People are more likely to check you out if you seem genuinely nice/friendly. I've asked heaps of my viewers if they stream and followed some of them and become friends with them because of that. They came in, seemed interested in me, the game I was playing and/or my chat and in doing so earned a follow from me. 

I appreciate every single follower I have, even if they do only tune in once or twice I like to think I did something right to earn there follow in the first place, to make them want to come back. 
So if you're only going to follow me in the hopes I'll follow you back, don't. I know that may be harsh but you wont be getting any sympathy follows from me. 

I hope this made sense, my thoughts are a bit scattered but I think I got my point across. Everything I said above I basically said to the guy in my stream today but a tldr version. He unfollowed me after that. End rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6i6nbl/i_would_rather_you_not_follow_me_at_all_than/,1497881544.0,76,0.84,45,Twitch,iLoveLamp_xox
6i4nmj,Why no growth? vs Why me? My experiences on twitch for new streamers and vets alike worried their stream.,"Lately, more so than usual, I been seeing a question pop up. ""What am i doing wrong?"" or ""why am i not seeing growth?"" and one of the main reasons I keep coming back to this community here at /r/twitch is because even though i'm small. I have built a nice small community for my channel and i consider it a success, but I know i still have lots to learn. So reading these i always like reading the comments and seeing what others put and then add my 2 cents. So that is a little back-round there so you have an idea of where i'm coming from. I'm going to try and break this up in sections for easier reading. But take this with a grain of salt as these are my own opinions forged by my own experience. :)  

Now ""Why am i not seeing growth?"" or ""what am i doing wrong?"" 

* Viewers: 

To all you new streamers, and to all the streamers who have started and seen a drop off in visitors and the like. I know its hard but **STOP** watching your viewer list. If you have it in chat click that little X in your active chat viewers and close it. In your dashboard click your viewers so that it says "" Hover over to view"" Don't by any means look at it.  Whether you are a new streamer or a veteran streamer who's returning from a hiatus **DON'T** Look at it. One of the biggest enemies to all streamers are those numbers right there. Looking at those numbers while you are getting your feet under yourself will Demoralize you immensely. Doesn't matter if you have a large viewership either. The second you see drop off, the second you realize your 1 viewer has left it is very noticeable to viewers. It's a distraction for you, and its a total buzz-kill. If you are constantly looking at your viewership viewers will notice and if they are like me. they leave. Because we want your attention on 2 things. Chat for interaction if you do have a chat going. and your game. The only other thing you should ever check for any reason is your stream health to make sure your stream is ok.  you will see fluctuation in your viewership all the time. No matter what you are doing, how long you've been doing it, day your doing it on, and time. Play with time's, days, and the like. Find something that's good for you. 

**Why am i not growing? either followers, or viewers.**

There are many things that can contribute to this. but the TLDR; answer can only be answered by you asking yourself ""Whats wrong with me or my set up. "" Now it sounds harsher than it should so please read the long version. 

During your time returning to the stage, or debuting your stream there are multiple things you need to really ask yourself if you just aren't seeing any progress. I will bold them for ease of skimming. these are questions you definitely need to answer honestly if you want to find the root of your issue. and keep in mind. These things take time to work on, and no you will never perfect them. there is always room for learning. 

**Are you camera shy?**
If you are using a camera to capture yourself while you play your game Camera shyness can definitely be a mood killer for you. You will constantly be worrying about how you look, if its clear, body language, etc.  The only real solution to this if you are camera shy is to do it more often. Trust me. I hate my face, i hate my body, i hate everything about my appearance But it took me awhile but now being on camera is like second nature to me. and it doesn't bug me to see my own face anymore. Its helped me accept who i am and make goals for myself to take better care of myself. So if you want to be less camera shy. it will take time. but keep being on camera. 

**a re there technical issues?** 

Pop out your streams, watch your VODS, do literally everything to review your work. If you have people in your chat at all even friends. tell them to tell you something is messing up so you can figure out whats going on. Technical issues are going to happen. ALWAYS! no matter how good your equipment is. Something is going to go wrong. be it sound, video, caster, etc. Be prepared, learn how to fix it yourself. You have a multitude of resources at your disposal. Your stream is your baby and you need to learn how to take care of it. Google your issue, search for it on here in the search bar, youtube it! seriously i'm not joking when i say. if it's happening to you. its happened to others more tech savy, than you and usually its somewhere out there. You just have to put in the effort to find it. and if you think, ""oh no. someone will show me, i don't need to find it myself."" and you are trying to be a serious streamer, just shut down right now. You will not be a successful streamer if you do not put in the effort to take care of your stream. Google is your friend keep it close, keep it handy, and learn how to search for your issues. Once you have literally exhausted it all then ask the question. But unless you put effort in. your stream is going to tank. I've seen it happen, and i've had it happen to me when i first started out and that ended with me taking 6 months off with depression. 

**How do i fix Dead air?**

Dead air is something that will plague anyone. no matter what the experience is. Dead air sucks. It's boring, it makes you second guess yourself, and all around kinda kills the mood (Depending on the tone of the game) It's really hard to kick this habit. you stop talking, either because chat is dead, you get super focused, or you say something stupid that you feel you shouldn't have said and you just shut down inside. Everyone experiences dead air especially at the beginning. It still happens to me a lot but i am getting better at it. If you have an active chat you will have almost no dead air if you are interacting with them. but what if you don't have a chat? what if its just dead? Then you need to talk still. Talk about what you are doing in the game. Why are you doing it? what is the point?  Do you know facts about the game others might not? talk about them. Does the game have some kind of special meaning to you? talk about that! You are the entertainment, new people will come to your stream for 2 reasons. first and foremost. they want to see the game hands down. the second reason, is you. (unless they are a regular then most likely your the first reason.) We want to get to know you, relate to you, and we can't do that if you shut down. This will be hard for some people. it was hard for me as i'm an introvert. but really if you have dead air. talk about your day, things going on in your life. If you have a friend in chat. Interact with them joke with them, Find what works for you. But try to fill it. it takes practice. yes you might feel dumb now and then. but fight through it. 

**Social media, is it important?** 

Yes. social media is very important. getting your name out there is how you are going to attract new people, and potentially followers. Twitter is my go to but i know others use insta-gram, snapchat, etc.
I don't know much about others just twitter. But learn to tweet. Learn to use hashtags (#) and fill up that bar. Link your stream, tag the dev company, post @ people like the @twitchraids etc. There are many social media resources dedicated to helping you get other people into your stream. Have your friends tweet out!. 


**why should i network with others?** 

Yes. regardless of what you think, and what others think, Networking is a key thing in becoming a successful streamer. The reason is simple. You scratch my back, i may scratch your back. Don't ever assume that someone is going to help you back because you will look dumb. And it doesn't happen over night. The truth is, anyone you help can potentially help you pull in a bigger crowd. your chat can help you pull in one to. I was lucky enough that one time a streamer came into my chat and started talking to me. I didn't know he was a streamer at the time, i didn't know anything about them. But we talked, we learned about eachother and the like. He didn't talk about his stream at first or anything. It was subtle when he did mention he was a streamer. After i was done streaming i paid a visit to his stream by doing a small raid. Just because thats what i wanted to do. i didn't want or expect anything in return for it. its just where i was going to hang out after i was done streaming. he gave me a shout out, hell he gives me one when i say hi in his chat i see him streaming and tune in. Because of him i got into contact with youtubers, and other streamers, and they've been helping me. critiquing me, and just over all boosting my signal. Yes networking helps. Before i had this stroke of luck i networked with smaller streamers as well, and i still do. Talk to them, learn about them, give em shout outs and let your chat know ""if you like me then you might like this guy or gal."" Signal boosting almost always leads to a domino effect. Use it! if you see  a person you know is a streamer give em a shout out. You never know when Karma, luck, or w/e you believe in will come back and reward you. 

**What bot do i use, and how do i use it properly?**

This one is a bit tougher to answer as there is no correct answer. Each bot is good in its own way. Research them, ask streamers who use the different ones why they chose that one. But one thing i will warn you about. And this is my personal opinion. Do not use the call out feature for them, where it announces when someone joins your channel. Yes, on paper its nice to greet people as they enter. But using a bot to call it out 1, it doesn't seem genuine, and 2 some people, myself included, don't want attention. The second i see a bot call me out or the streamer call me out when i enter a channel i leave without a second glance. other people who like to lurk don't like this spotlight as we now feel forced to engage and that's not what anyone wants. 


**i started doing this because another streamer is doing it and im still not seeing growth. Why?**

Dont compare yourself to other streamers, new, old, partner, affiliate, or neither. This is not a competition. This is us being entertainers. The second you start comparing is the second you fall victim to what every new streamer falls victim to and quits because of. Doubt. For 2 reasons. You will either mimic the other streamers which you wont see growth for and eventually quit due to disheartening. This isnt you. And the audience will tell. Or you start comparing instantly and realize since your either not funny, not good, not interesting or w/e and instantly quit due to disheartening. This right now is the beginning of your journey. You are starting out. We have all been here before. We have all made every one of these mistakes. This right now is where you start developing you. Developing your stream. Developing your brand. No one is not cut out for streaming. Everyone has some kind of community they can potentially reach.   

(honestly this is an excerpt from a comment i wrote for another streamer and i feel like it says it all so i copy and pasted this.) 

whether your new, thinking about streaming, or a vet returning. always remember that you have full control over your channel. you dictate everything. focus on developing yourself. you don't need to worry about numbers, or anything. Do this for yourself and eventually the numbers will come. I personally believe that everyone has the potential to become a good streamer. my only other piece of advice can be this. 

Don't play the game because its popular. play because you want to play it. a lot of people will tell you to play smaller populated games because it will boost your chance of getting recognized. But what happens when you change your game up? Do you keep alot of the viewers you had? chances or slim to none that no you won't. some will come along with you to another game but not all. the only time this works is if you stream it long enough to develop a bond with your community and they stop comming for the game and come for you. Play what you want to play. don't let anyone tell you different. I personally am a variety streamer. Yes it's hard. My growth is slow. But i have a tighter bond with my little community than i've seen with others. if you put in the work and effort you will see growth. It's true. some games will have more growth than others. I would avg around 4-5 viewers for the longest time with some games. Now i'm averaging 10-15 and i can tell you that right now. a good portion are most likely for the game. I get more traffic because right now im playing the Dark souls trilogy.  I've never seen the amount of traffic i get through my channel on my stats page before i started playing them. Am i going to keep playing them to keep viewers? No! as soon as im done with all 3 games i put them to the side and move on to a new game series to complete. I will lose some viewers, but the ones that stick around will be there for me. and those viewers, those people that come back just to hang out with you. those ones make you feel the best and make it all worth it. :) 

**Edit**

After reading all the comments it made me think of more stuff to add. ** trolls ** and ** communities ** 

lets start with the hard one first. 

**trolls** 

You are going to get them, small, large, medium. w/e you will experience them. but based on how you handle them is how its going to define your channel as well. If you flip out and go off on them. you will attract more! they are like bugs and you are the light. The best way to deal with trolls in my opinion as long as they are only harassing you and not your chat members. is to play with them. I get trolls all the time, especially because i'm playing darksouls. usually its the same kind to, the ""god you suck at this game"", ""you need to stop playing"" or "" hey dude, i think you died"". the captain obvious of the world seem to find me alot. now don't get mad, don't freak out, and overall don't by any means take what they say seriously. They are trying to get to you. trying to break you and establish dominance. Here is how you deal with them. 

Troll: God you suck at this game. you died to something stupid!

Streamer: RIGHT! holy crap man. why didn't i see that! 

It's very simple, and very effective. The trolls i get will try it 3 to 4 times max and if i react the same style each time they get pissed and leave. Because they realize you can't be effected by them so they go to find some one else. :) Play with your trolls it pisses them off more than they can piss you off. because they want an easy target. 

If they are harassing your chat, mods should be warning them of the rules. If the continue. Don't be afraid to use that ban-hammer. Call them out on it in stream. i see it all the time. if they are making your chat unsafe for your community. call them out on it and drop the ban-hammer on them. But still don't over react to it. Don't freak out, because you're showing dominance and if you freak out you're only showing weakness. 

**communities** 

This is my personal favorite feature they added to twitch. Communities are a second way to get noticed, Search them out. Do you want to get help setting the tone of your channel? use them! find the one that pertains to what you are doing at that time. Speed running is a great example of this. There are speed running communities and people who are searching for small channels because the chat isn't crazy use these alot! Personally i use them to find someone to raid ""unless its stated against in the community rules"" but communities are a thing. Check them out. learn about them. these will help you.

6i1poj,Are donation goals seen as tacky or do they actually work?,"I run a small to medium-sized channel and I often see a lot of other smaller channels set up donation goals for new set-ups or just for the streamer's personal needs.

I have always been kind of hesitant about this type of thing because personally I get turned off from donation to another streamer myself when I see, ""Help fund my new car"" or ""Help me buy a pent house."" When I see goals like that I don't leave the stream or anything but I might think twice about donating.

On the other hand when I see someone raising maybe a few hundred dollars for a new graphics card I feel like chipping in if I like them.

I am wondering how many of you also share my sentiment. On a side note I looked into setting up a donation goal with this guide: https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/217741147-Setting-up-the-Event-list and it wouldn't show for w.e reason, not sure why. (edit: someone messaged me and helped me fix it in a few mins, thanks random redditor)

Anyways, on the flip side I see a lot of larger streamers not bother with donation goals. I think the perspective from them is that they might make so much money that people will be turned off from donating if they see how much they made. Am I right in my thinking here? If so, does this mean donation goals make sense for smaller streamers since people see how little you might make, and feel more inclined to support you?

It was the same issue I was having with livestreamer.

One person in particular who I met when I was five really sticks out. She was a huge part of my life. We grew up together. She introduced me to Final Fantasy and also anime. We were friends all the way until we were about 21. At this time she ended up moving to Florida and I actually didn't see or hear from her for years. 
I'm 28 now. I stream about 36 hours a week and have really turned into quite the weeb.... Anyways, the other night I got a visitor in my channel with a username I recognized. She used write these stories that included a character with a very memorable name. Only she would use that username so when she came into my channel that day I asked what street she grew up on so I could be positive that it was her. It most definitely was. It was like we never stopped chilling. We used to just hang out and watch each other play JRPGs. I was playing Persona 5 when she came in and she happened to be playing it too. It made me so happy to be able to hang out with her again. Thanks Twitch for bringing my childhood friend back to me to bond over the same thing we always have bonded over.

I applied for the first time on 10th April, then I applied again a month ago, and again about a week ago. I sent them a followup email to the first application nearly a month ago asking for some kind of update as to what was going on with my application, and I've heard nothing from them on that. I've tried contacting two different Twitch staff members, one of which works on the partnership team, what's going on, and no response.

I'm so frustrated. I'm expecting to be accepted but even if I'm declined I don't care so long as I finally get a response, my viewers have been getting ""soon"" as an answer for over 2 months and I still have no idea whether the response will *actually* be ""soon"" or whether it'll be in another few months time, if ever. Is there anywhere I can reach Twitch and find out what's taking so long?

6gkhp0,June 19th marks my 90th day streaming.,"Hey, guys. As many of you are, I am a streamer who is very new to this whole broadcasting thing. I removed my flair due to the fact I don't want this to be a post where people think I am discretely advertising, because it's not. I'd just like to share my experience with others who may be new to streaming as well.

Anyways, a little bit about me. Three years ago I became very ill and was hospitalized. After a bunch of time in the hospital and tests and all that other jazz, I was diagnosed with a very rare neurological disorder. I ended up more so on the severe end of the spectrum for the condition so it actually caused me to go on disability and pretty much keeps me at home most of the time. Nothing life threatening, but it makes day-to-day stuff nearly impossible at times. I've prefaced this because it is an important thing to the reasons why streaming has become so important to me. 

Anyways, being stuck at home, I started using the internet to spend times with friends as leaving my house was becoming more and more difficult. I was very active and social prior to becoming diagnosed so the little contact I had with everyone prior was killing me. I enjoyed playing games, but the thing that kept me coming back was the interaction I had with the friends I was playing with. I didn't game with them much before as I traveled for work and the short times that I was allowed to be home, I spent as much time as I could engaging myself with other things. 

Some time later, my friends kept telling me that I should stream because I was fun to play with and they loved having me SharePlay on PlayStation and would just sit and talk to me while they watched me play games and go about my normal antics and shenanigans.

Eventually, I decided to give it a shot because I figured, ""What the hell, why not? I literally click a button and do what I normally do. Worst case scenario, they don't harass me about it anymore and it doesn't work out.""

Three months later I am incredibly grateful that they hounded me as much as they have to broadcast. I'm by no means incredibly successful or anything of the sorts on Twitch. Which, in all seriousness, is perfectly fine by me. The thing that has been the most rewarding has been the people I've met. Very few people know that I'm disabled and stuck at home. It's something I've never really ""brought up"" on stream because I don't think it matters and I've never wanted any pity from anyone. Even so, I may tell them one night on stream just to because I appreciate them and want them to know why I miss some of my scheduled streams.  The positive nature from these people who know nothing about me is absolutely amazing. I literally never believed that there was this many genuine people. Negativity is infectious and the past few years have been rough so I always try to be as positive as I possibly can so I never bring it up to them and my viewers always keep me laughing and brighten up my day. (Side note: To those of you on this subreddit who are viewers... Thank you. Honestly. All of us streamers could never possibly elaborate just how much you being there and spending your time watching and communicating with us really means.)

I'm still beyond words as to how I could ever maintain the attention of 15-20 people on a nightly basis by merely engaging and talking with them. It's an incredibly humbling experience and I've met some amazing people in the process. 

I'm really glad this platform exists for people to be creative and interact with others. It really filled a void for me that I didn't even know had existed and I am incredibly grateful of both Twitch and all the people who use it. 

Regardless, what I really wanted to say is... If you're streaming for the right reasons, no matter what they may be... Even if your channel is slow to grow... Appreciate everything. Thank the people who come in to watch you stream. Be genuine and thoughtful and ask them how their day was. Initiate conversation and encourage them and learn about who they are. I have met some incredibly wonderful people by doing this and have learned to appreciate each and every viewer. If you're ever concerned about your viewer count, remember this. They're not numbers, they're a part of your community. Treat them as so.

Regardless, this may be a bit of babble as it's 4 AM and I am super tired and can't sleep and just had some things on my mind and felt like sharing. I hope you all have had positive outcomes in your endeavors with Twitch and I hope you are all having a great weekend.

6ge5hp,Thank you to the ones who Pay it forward,"Late last week I finally found a stream schedule that works for me and have been sticking to it. I had someone join up and ask in my chat why I was so happy. I just replied that I'm having fun and playing with friends. He responded by telling me he loves my energy and stream and wants to host me.

Fast forward 6 days and he has hosted me every single night with viewers ranging from 20 all the way to 221. There is a huge language barrier between me and them as they all speak Spanish and I only know a few words. But there is so much positive engagement in chat, it makes me smile from ear to ear.

Thank you to everyone that pays it forward and helps us little guys out. Even if its not 100 people every night waiting, it makes streaming worth it, knowing there's a community of people excited to chat and just hang out. When I get the chance, I will pay it forward as well.

6g8pk3,10 Things New Streamers Do that Turn Me Away,"I enjoy watching small streams. Heck, I only start from the bottom of the list and work up when looking for a new stream to watch. But not all small streams are great. In fact, many new streams I find seem to have a few pitfalls in common that I feel are bad habits or are hurting their stream/channel. Now, not all streamers care about building a community, but for those that are, these aren't good ways to:

* **Not having a schedule** Even if you have no idea what your schedule is, let us know! Or give us a general idea (ex. weeknights until whenever). Because if I like your stream, I'll first check your schedule to see if I should follow because I won't follow unless I know when to expect watching you.

* **Your only panel is a donation button.** Pretty self-explanatory. We know what your priority is... Especially when it's a giant donation button. 

* **You ask for a follow, host, and/or donation within minutes.** I just got here! Let me watch before I decide to show support. I understand you're trying to grow, but that's like a musician on the street asking for a tip after playing one note... 

* **Awful video/audio quality.** Now, a lot of new streamers have bad streams early-on, but after that, you should have worked out any technical issues. Some streamers have horrible mic quality (using their webcam to talk causing echoes and distortion), unbalanced audio levels (music is 4x louder than the streamer's voice), some have unsynced video/audio which grinds my gears, and many have laggy streams. I usually notify the streamer and let it slide, but if the streamer doesn't address it several streams later, I know they don't want to put in the effort.  

* **Having a bland. boring title.** I don't even click on these streams and move onto the next. Examples? Here's a few: ""Playing CS:GO with friends"" ""OW stream"" ""PUBG gameplay"" ...thrilling.

* **Streamers who don't care about their chat.** This may not apply to everyone, but I watch Twitch to interact with people. If I wanted to watch gameplay, I'd go to YouTube. So I do like to type in chat to get a conversation going. I know I am not entitled to get a response, but when a streamer just focuses on gameplay, I end up leaving immediately. (I know you're new and used to having 0 chat activity, but do glance over once in a while...)
 
* **Having every overlay known to man on screen.** I mean, we get you're trying to look...um, legitimate? But you don't need so much stuff taking up space when you just started a week ago: Top All-time Donator, Top Monthly Donator, Recent Donator, etc... c'mon, really? And this is your 2nd stream?

* **Not playing the right game** Yeah, this I also skip  along with bland titles. If you're playing WoW but is listed under Battlefield 1, there's a 99% chance I won't stop by. I know sometimes we forget to update titles, but it's very important to make a habit to check before a stream and when you change games mid-stream. 

* **Follower only chat** We know followers mean the world to you, but this is not a good way to start off. Don't think ""oh if they want to chat, they'll have to follow! Easy follows!"" As a new streamer you should welcome everyone into your chat (excluding trolls of course). 

* **Having a poor attitude** Complaining about growth, emphasizing how badly you want to make a living from this, looking sad when peeking at the viewer count, etc.. Just bums viewers out and makes the stream hard to watch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6g8pk3/10_things_new_streamers_do_that_turn_me_away/,1497018181.0,261,0.77,268,Twitch,[deleted]

6fvv87,OBS now has an NDI Plugin = No Capture Card for Dual PC Setups,"I've been following this for awhile and it has actually been completed for awhile however it was officially posted last week. It is the [NDI plugin for OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/ndi-input-output-plugin-for-obs-studio.69240/). 

**This is the solution for users that have 144hz monitors and are tired of Windows 10 or even 8.1 dropping the HZ of the monitor to 60hz or even lower when duplicating or extending their display to their 60hz capture card**

**What does this do?** It allows you to use a very minimal amount of CPU usage, nearly as much when just having OBS open and send raw captured frames without rendering to a receiving device on your network. It also provides only ms delay. For more details, it is made by NewTek, royalty free, and here is their website https://www.newtek.com/ndi/. 

**I've heard of other things like RTMP that were somewhat complicated and had delays. What's the catch?** When streaming NDI it uses a large amount of bits. On average I am using about 250mbit/s but this does not hinder my internet nor will it hinder yours depending on your router.

**How I did my setup:** Both gaming and Stream PC have two Ethernet adapters. All I did was plug one Ethernet to the other. This keeps the NDI of my main network. I'm only doing it this way cause I'm using wifi for internet. **This is not necessary if you have two PCs wired to the same router to switch. Wifi is not recommended with this setup.**

* Installed the plugin. 

* Restarted the PCs. Opened OBS Tools on gaming PC and checked the Output NDI. 

* Opened OBS on stream PC and added the NDI source.

**Why not use RTMP?** RTMP has a delay that can be variable even on the same network. Usually this delay is around 2 to 3 seconds which creates a situation that is quite frustrating to sync audio. NDI has about ~~the same delay as the Elgato HD 60 Pro which is around 140ms~~ double the delay of the HD60pro but it seems to be consistent. If you do not have enough bandwidth to receive the NDI signal from the gaming PC it usually ends up not being delayed further but you'll receive skipping in the frames from when I was testing it on Wifi hence why I don't recommend using this setup on wifi. In addition to this you also do not worry about ports or IPs. You just select the available streaming device under the NDI source once the streamed OBS NDI is started.

**Can I transfer Audio?** Yes, but the plugin is limited to certain sources. Luckily, game source is one of them.

**I have Xsplit, can I use it with it?** Yes, and actually Xsplit has had this feature but it doesn't seem to run as well. Developers from NewTek worked directly with this plugin to get it working properly. I am currently streaming with Xsplit but I'm using OBS NDI plugin on the gaming PC to send the signal to the streaming PC.

*Also special thanks to Pepcnation for telling me about this feature.*

**NOTE** It is possible that the quality streamed by NDI is less than that captured by the cards. I personally have seen maybe a slight loss but to me its negligible and worth it if you are having issues with hz or tearing. When recording high bitrate recordings like 25mbit with x264 rendering, I found 0 loss in quality. If a 120hz or higher capture card that comes out for consumers that is actually reasonably priced then I'll switch to that. In the mean time this is free and extremely easy to setup.

6f7p9d,Wouldn't the new VODCAST feature be hurting the smaller channels down at the bottom?,"Hello, first of all I am not 100% certain how vodcast works, so please correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like vodcast is a way for your channel to appear live... without actually being live. The amount of viewers you have and where you are in the directory is exactly how many people are in your channel watching your vodcast at that moment. So if eventually everybody starts to use vodcast, wouldn't that completely drown out a lot of the smaller channels that are below 10, or 5 viewers in a game? The way I look at it is, those channels already have trouble being noticed. Now they have competition with channels that aren't even live. If I'm missing something here, please let me know. OR if you don't believe this to be a problem, please tell me why you think so. I went through some directories and found a bunch of ""VODCAST"" live channels that I don't follow, so some people are definitely using this feature.

EDIT: I'm honestly just curious. I feel like this is actually a SUPER cool feature, but it was one that wasn't entirely thought out or was thought out with larger channels in mind. I know many factors come into play, like which game directory you mostly stream in. However, my point still stands. The top 15-20 game directories on Twitch ARE what you would call ""over-saturated"" and thus, making it a little more difficult for new viewers to find your live channel. As of right now, this isn't actually an issue. I'm hypothetically speaking about if and when many, many other (large and smaller) channels start to use the vodcast feature. Thanks.

2ND EDIT: For anybody who doubts that vodcast won't have an affect on smaller streamers at the bottom, just look at this post. As of writing, it's at the top of this subreddit with a lot of feedback. If you look at the top comment, it's the one that's most noticed and has the most upvotes. Why? Because that is just fundamentally how social websites work. I think all of us know that, without me saying. If I am new to the game called Destiny and decided to go into the Destiny directory and watch a stream to learn about the game, I am much more likely to click the very first channel with the most viewers as opposed to the 2nd channel next to it. Not all of us are like that, but that's just how I am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6f7p9d/wouldnt_the_new_vodcast_feature_be_hurting_the/,1496587808.0,105,0.9,86,Twitch,[deleted]
6ewkvs,Social Media Popup for Your Stream (version 2),"Hey everyone!

I just recently released a social media popup that you can customize and add into OBS Studio and XSplit, and would love to share with r/Twitch.

[Check it out here](https://nerdordie.com/product/social-media-popup-v2/)

As with a lot of our items, put in ""0"" in the name your price box to receive it for free.

Anyways, this version is a big step up from the last one I did in a few ways:
* Add your own icons or choose from a preset list
* Customize all colors
* Decide how often each popup stays on stream + how long before it loops
* Choose any Google based font

6etn8a,Blurring out a portion of your screen in OBS Studio,"So I made my first and likely only guide in video form [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PODw_nHUbQ) showing how you can get a real-time blurring effect in OBS Studio.

The effect is suitable for covering rowdy/obnoxious chatboxes or other stationary sections of the screen you'd like to obscure. 

And in case you don't wanna watch my hastily put-together video, here it is in text form:

1. Create a NEW, separate capture source for the game in question. In my case I used a new Window Capture.
2. Right click on this new source and go to Filters.
3. Make a Scaling/Aspect Ratio filter. Use **Point** for Scale Filtering and **640x360** (or lowest setting available) for Resolution. Close the Filters window.
4. Click and drag a corner of the now-smaller Window Capture source to make it fill the screen again. (Note: Do not use Transform&gt;Fit to Screen.)
5. Right click the source again. Go to Scale Filtering and select **Point**.
6. Use Alt+drag to crop the source down to just the area you want to obscure.
7. You're done!

You can play around with the Point/Bilinear filter settings to get the look you want, though I found that using Point is better at obscuring things than other settings.

6esbrz,Vulnerability discovered in Streampro.io,"Tonight while tinkering with Streampro.io, a friend and I have discovered a very serious vulnerability in Streampro.io.  If anyone is using this free service for their Twitch overlays, I highly recommend checking your account on their site, and to stop using their service until this vulnerability is patched.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to log in to Streampro.io as *any* user.  I will not disclose details beyond that or the process on how to become another user.

We have sent direct messages to their Twitter account and also submitted a support message to them on their web site.  They do not seem to be very active, as the Twitter account has not posted since September 2016 and their website copyright still says 2015.

I am posting here to warn Twitch users who may use Streampro.io that their accounts on that site are vulnerable.  If you have donations set up, someone could use this attack to change your Paypal information to their own and start accepting your donations.  They could be more subtle and change your overlays and events to do some bad things on your stream, which could have potential to get your Twitch account warned/banned.

Hopefully someone from Streampro.io responds and they can patch this up.  Until then, you have been warned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6esbrz/vulnerability_discovered_in_streamproio/,1496379218.0,73,0.96,21,Twitch,ganiman1

* what is the best game to stream?
* when is the best time to stream?


And as we all know, there is no one answer. Popular games are over saturated with channels and regarding times, it's impossible to say due to each game having its own demographic.

So I've created a website that updates every hour to show you:

* **What to play** (Games with low channels broadcasting but high views)
* **What not to play** (Games with high channels broadcasting but low views)
* **Heat map of every game** (So you can see channels, views, ratio over a week)

(These stats are updated every hour, so ""What to play"" will change every hour)

The website isn't perfect just yet, but I will be working on it more over the next month, and the next update will allow you to log in and input the games you own. Then before you broadcast you can quickly sign in, and see what games out of your collection are currently high in demand, but have a lower channels broadcasting.

Also longer the site is up, more of an average it can generate. So be sure to check back over time to see it change.

I hope you find this tool useful, and I've wrote a quick [FAQ](http://twitchstrike.com/faqs) that explains ratio vs channel vs viewes that might be worth a quick read.

Edit
**if the reports don't load, disable adblock**

I have no adverts anyway. So you are safe, but reports are coming in ad block is stopping the files from loading. I will look in to this issue ASAP. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6elsp3/ive_made_a_website_with_a_heat_map_showing_when/,1496311873.0,658,0.94,178,Twitch,WHELDOT

6e8evq,[Tool] Get notifications when a streamer plays a specific game.,"Ever since Lirik started playing GTA 5 RP I've seen a lot of people ask every day in his chat ""when is gta?"" ""gta today?"" etc.

That's when I started to work on this website to get notified when that happens. So you can enter like ""When LIRIK starts streaming Grand Theft Auto V, notify me"".

You can get notified by either desktop notification (like facebook messages) or by e-mail.

This tool is useful for variety streamers who play a lot of different games. Or big events like Games Done Quick, maybe there are some speedruns that you really don't want to miss?

6e7tzi,600+ viewer stream playing fri13th,"So I usually average 15-20 viewers per stream with a pretty active chat. I was streaming fri13th 2 nights ago and it was just like any other night stream. People came through and hung out but, what happened that night I'll never forget. 

I saw my viewer count go from 15 to 25. I thought to myself ""oh nice hell yeah more people are coming in to watch"" then 25 jumped to 34 and then to 47, then to 52. I was honestly surprised because for a smaller streamer you never really get seen when you are at the bottom of the barrel for a newly released game.

Then I saw 52 jump up to 70 viewers, then I broke 100 viewers! My jaw dropped and was thinking to myself ""maybe I'm getting viewbotted??"" But more and more people were chatting and saw comments flying on my screen. 101 viewers then went up to 120, 155, then I broke 200 viewers! Insane! That's a personal streaming record of mine and was honestly so crazy.

I thought it was gonna stop there but no. I kept playing and trying to talk to everyone in the chat, then I saw I hit 300 viewers! What in the world. I kept getting follow after follow saying thank you so much to everyone. I never take for granted any single follower because they make up the stream and keep your channel alive!

Saw 300 viewers climb up to 400! Guys, I know this post doesn't sound believable and it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I have the proof. None of my mods and usual crowd could believe what was going on. 

400 shot up to 550 viewers! Of course it would fluctuate between 400-450-559-521-580-510-490-540 viewers. Then I hit 680 viewers as my max. I was in awe. I couldn't believe what was happening. 

I usually stream 2-3 hours per stream but I was having way too much fun talking with everyone that I stayed up and streamed for like 7 hours. Started at 10 pm and didn't end till 5:00 am (only because my game crashed and I was worn out from the chatting and playing games and just being overwhelmed with so many people watching) 

Absolutely insane. Will never forget this stream. The craziest Twitch experience by far. Thank you for reading :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6e7tzi/600_viewer_stream_playing_fri13th/,1496156205.0,209,0.85,67,Twitch,xxGioDudexx
6e4iw1,Just want to thank Twitch staff for taking time during their lunch break to help me set up my stream,"I'm not a big streamer, a medium sized streamer, or even a small streamer. I'm a new streamer. I was struggling with setting everything up, and my settings caused me issues for OBS/streamlabs, so I tweeted a twitch staff member and as I expected a one sentence reply to maybe a help link, he understood I had a series of tweaks needed to be made and asked me if I was free teamviewer him so he could help me. 

I asked him if he usually does this, and he replied that he does so every now and then when he has free time. I don't see many companies go out of their way like this, especially considering I'm not some top streamer who gets dedicated support, I'm some newbie who likely will not end up making Twitch a lot of cash. 

Some of the links that we used involved troubleshooting OBS where I was getting frame drops/lag spikes in game and setting up my event list for alerts. I hope if anyone else has those problems maybe these links can help u too: https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/dropped-frames-disconnecting-lag-read-this-first.8870/

https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/217741147-Setting-up-the-Event-list

At the end of it, while he said it was not a problem at all for helping in the end of the session and that I don't need to give anything in return, I want to at least highlight the fact that this happened, so if anyone is feeling hesitant about anything Twitch related, and it's not due to some violation, Twitch's staff can be really helpful, which I wish I could say the same for when talking about a lot of other companies out there. 

I did not plan on streaming very regularly at the start, but now I kind of want to just because of how well this guy treated me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6e4iw1/just_want_to_thank_twitch_staff_for_taking_time/,1496110435.0,129,0.85,28,Twitch,hakai2
6dyp2j,My first day was incredible,"So, i have a nice computer. I dont use to its capabilities though as i dont really have a reason to. My friend asks me to stream Eve Online for him, since he wants something to watch and relax to. I download OBS, set up real quick, and start the stream. It was obviously really just me and him for a while, chatting about the game, discussing why we like space games so much. 

Then, another viewer comes in, he introduces himself and asks how long ive been playing Eve. Well, i had only just started that day so i tell him. He's incredibly friendly and welcomes me to the game. Then a few more show up and to be honest i didnt expect anybody to watch but my friend. Next thing you know theres a handful of people actively talking in chat, giving me tips, and everybody is really kind. One was so kind that he donated me in game money, a lot for a new player, chump change for him. Regardless, it was heavily appreciated. Then another viewer doubles his donation.

I was speechless. I honestly had to take a moment. On my first day of streaming i had almost 20 viewers in the span of 2 hours, and they were more than i could have asked for. As the nights wrapping up im getting pretty tired, and i call it a night. By the time i had signed of i ended with a total of 30 viewers.. and i couldnt have been happier.

Thank you so much to the twitch community who actively help not only new players in their game, but new streamers and give an extended welcome. Todays stream might not have been nearly successful, but honestly, id stream forever if it meant being able to experience such a welcoming set of people again. Thank you, honestly.

6dj9ke,Can we shadow ban?,"We have all had them. The viewer that just wants to be seen. They are so edgy and say the worst things their prepubescent brains can conjure up. They want a rise out of you, and by banning them you fees into what they seek. They make another account and continue because of lulz.  
  
We need a /sban option. Shadow ban, for those not aware is a silent ban that only the mods and streamer would be aware of even taking place. Imagine that same troll, unaware that he is talking to himself. Carrying on until he is bored. Mods and streamer don't open themselves to ridicule from possible accomplices in chat and keeps other viewers from the drama.

6df3gv,"State of the Subreddit: 150,000 subscribers... that was quick. We're celebrating TwitchUnity!","# Hey /r/Twitch!
 
We appear to have raced to 150,000 subscribers. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were celebrating 100,000.

6cix9k,I created a chat viewer to help streamers keep up with interesting messages in chat,"Hi there,

I have created a **chat viewer** that allows you to separate interesting chat messages from the copypasta in your chat.
It splits the chat into two different feeds so you as the broadcaster can keep up with what chat is saying.

Here is a short gif showing it in use: https://i.gyazo.com/b1bd59f3e3a0867f86702f0e6dc5d461.gif

It can be used on desktop or on mobile for IRL: https://i.imgur.com/O2IX5sY.jpg

You can see it used and how the settings are configured here: https://youtu.be/_VbZPYNwgl0

### Check it out @ [https://chitchat.ma.pe](https://chitchat.ma.pe)  

---

**Update:** If you want a standalone Windows application instead of using your browser you can test this experimental exe version: 
https://chitchat.ma.pe/ChitChat-win32-x64.zip

---

**Features:**

* Separates messages that fit certain criteria into a separate feed (that you can disable entirely if you feel like it)
* Highlights people you follow on Twitch in green so they stand out
* Shows highlighted message when people subscribe
* Shows messages that are directed at @you in red
* Shows thumbnail and title of youtube links so you don't keep getting rickrolled (same with twitch clips)
* Lightweight and no need to login
* Enable/disable if you only want to show subscriber messages (allows non subs to speak but you won't see them)
* Show/hide emotes
* Show/hide badges
* Show/hide stream preview in top
* Light &amp; dark theme
* Show/hide subscription messages
* Customise banned words
* **Update:** Set font size

6caxys,"OBS Studio 19.0 has been released - includes auto-configuration and stats dialog, other fixes","&gt;https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/releases/tag/19.0.2

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; #Changelog:
&gt; 
&gt; **General Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Added an auto-configuration wizard to the tools menu and on first-time use, which will attempt to automatically test and configure video/encoding/streaming settings based upon your system and internet connection. This wizard is currently in beta and may be subject to change, feedback is appreciated here: https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-studio-19-0-0-auto-configure-feedback-megathread.68509/
&gt; * Added a stats dialog to the view menu (with the option to show it on start it up in general settings). The stats dialog shows advanced statistics, such as: average frame rendering time, frames lost due to encoding/rendering/network lag, HDD space left in recording location, and how much data has been output total.
&gt; * Added a ""Render Delay"" filter that allows delaying non-async video sources such as display capture or window capture. Note this is only meant for minor sync adjustments (e.g. syncing your screen capture to a webcam), and because the delayed frames are stored on very limited VRAM, the allowable maximum delay is 500 milliseconds (which is 250 megabytes of VRAM on a 1080p 60 FPS source)
&gt; * Added the ability to copy and paste filters between sources
&gt; * Added Ctrl-E as a shortcut to edit transform of sources
&gt; * Added a command line option to start as always on top (--always-on-top)
&gt; * Added a ""shuffle"" option to the VLC video source
&gt; * Added the ability to copy and paste sources (with transforms) from one scene to another
&gt; * Added specific error messages displayed to the user when fail to connect
&gt; * Added an option to the blackmagic source that allows you to specify the channel format
&gt; * Added the ability to project a source, scene, or the preview on to a resizable window in the right-click context menu when right-clicking on sources or the preview
&gt; * Reworked the media source: media files set to activate when switching to a scene will now immediately start play back when you switch to their scene without requiring time to load
&gt; * Reworked the media source: media files will now loop properly with no abnormalities in sound playback
&gt; * Fixed a bug where scenes could be unintentionally lost under specific crash circumstances (backup files were always present, but were not being used -- this is now fixed)
&gt; * Fixed an issue where the blackmagic source can start up or spontaneously go out of sync
&gt; * Fixed dragging and dropping text files to create a text source on non-windows systems
&gt; * Fixed a bug where devices outputting NV12 (e.g. Logitech BRIO cams) would have distorted colors
&gt; * Fixed a bug where frame dropping would not happen properly when using the ultrafast x264 preset
&gt; * Fixed a bug from 18.0.2 where ""downmix to mono"" would no longer save
&gt; * Fixed a potential crash under specific circumstances when OBS is set to minimize to task tray
&gt; * When dragging and dropping text files to create a source, those sources will now have the same name as the text file being dropped
&gt; * All dialogs should now have close buttons (useful on certain window managers such as gnome)
&gt; * Filter names are now sorted when adding new filters
&gt; 
&gt; **Windows Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Added an option to disable audio ducking on windows, now on by default. Prevents the system from lowering volume of programs when the mic is activated by OBS
&gt; * Added HEVC recording support to the AMD encoder
&gt; * Added Two-Pass and Full-Range color support to the AMD encoder
&gt; * The AMD Encoder has been completely rewritten from scratch for improved stability, performance and new features. All advanced configurations will break due to this change
&gt; * The cursor will now be hidden when you are alt-tabbed out of the captured game/window when using window or game capture
&gt; * Fixed an issue where the device source would activate on startup even when it's in another scene and set to deactivate when not visible
&gt; * Fixed and clarified window capture prioritization. ""Title"" will now match any window of the exact window title, ""class"" will try to find a window by the title otherwise match any window of the same window type, and ""exe"" will match any window of the same title or if not found any window of the same program.
&gt; * Fixed a crash when using QSV to encode
&gt; * Fixed a bug where log files wouldn't be created when the current windows user had unicode characters in the name
&gt; * Fixed an issue with the AMD encoder which would make it difficult to seek on certain file types
&gt; * (Repeating 18.0.2 in case it was missed) Fixed poor game capture performance with some DirectX 9 games on the Windows 10 ""Creator's Update"" as well as some cases Windows 7
&gt; 
&gt; **Linux Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Added the auto scene switcher to linux
&gt; * Fixed a potential crash in the settings dialog
&gt; 
&gt; **Mac Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Fixed an issue where you would not always be able to select all available fonts in the text source

**UPDATE: Hotfix 2 has rolled in:**

&gt;https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/releases/tag/19.0.2

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; #Changelog:
&gt; 
&gt; **19.0.1 Hotfix Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Fixed a bug where the auto-configuration wizard would sometimes not save settings
&gt; * Fixed a bug where if you press cancel/back while connecting during a bandwidth test the program would freeze indefinitely
&gt; * Fixed a bug where unintentional whitespace would not be removed from the end of the stream key in the auto-configuration wizard, and would cause connection to fail when performing a bandwidth test
&gt; * Fixed an issue where the AMD encoder was no longer showing up in the 64bit version
&gt; * Fixed a crash when using certain lossless RGB media files with the new media source
&gt; 
&gt; **19.0.2 Hotfix Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Fixed a startup crash with older AMD drivers when using the 32bit version of OBS. Please update your video drivers!
&gt; * Fixed a bug that caused Freetype 2 text sources to stop rendering properly on windows
&gt; * Fixed an issue with NVENC not initializing properly for some people on older drivers
&gt; * Fixed a tooltip that's supposed to show when you hover over ""prefer hardware encoding"" in the auto-configuration wizard",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6caxys/obs_studio_190_has_been_released_includes/,1495294397.0,213,0.95,48,Twitch,byeratheism

6c4jge,I only started to actually grow my stream at a healthy rate once I stopped stressing out about viewership and stopped comparing myself to others,"When I started out streaming, I was chill about it for the first month or so, and then I started stressing more and more about if I was growing and I would often compare myself to others. This changed who I was as a streamer and made me not act like myself, as I tried to sometimes act like people I thought were popular. It turned out, this was just way too much of a headache to keep up with and I asked myself, do I actually enjoy what I am doing? The answer at the time was no, and it made me remember why I started in the first place; to push myself to do better (at league) and to teach others, since I genuinely love teaching people things regardless of what it is I'm teaching.

I think its so important to remind yourself to take it easy sometimes, and to let things naturally run their course. I had to face the reality that I wasn't going to make a living or side-living off playing video games, and that if I should continue streaming, it should be because I enjoy it, not because I want it to replace my job.

So fast forward 2 months, and slowly but surely my channel is growing. All I do is enjoy myself, try to be happy, and try to teach people, which is what I set out to do in the first place. My viewership has gone from 3-5 viewers at any given time to now 18-25, and every week or so the average increases by 1-2 ppl. I did also join a [guild](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/guilds) recently which helps me talk to others and to motivate one another. 

I know streamer burnout is very real, I have seen it happen to a lot of my friends, but I hope the message I get across is that if you just stream for enjoyment then burnout won't really be a thing for you, and your enjoyment reflects onto your viewers, which helps you in the long run.

6bzv9w,"So Twitch made a subtle change to how Blacklisted Words/Emotes are handled in Twitch chat, now they work with Automod, and that it can't be turned off entirely anymore.","So during my stream today I noticed that one of the emotes I had blacklisted in my chat triggered automod, and I know I never touched automod because I never wanted it on in my chat, but now whenever someone types a message that has the particular emote, it rejects the entire message instead of just changing the censored word into *** as it used to be.  On top of that, automod now goes from having Level 0 (being that it's now turned off) to Rule 0, to only blocking common words, or anything in the blacklist of words/emotes, and this can't be turned off. I do not like this change at all. It was fine the way it was before. http://puu.sh/vUlQH/dc7e4ea8c5.png",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/6bzv9w/so_twitch_made_a_subtle_change_to_how_blacklisted/,1495148965.0,53,0.92,11,Twitch,SilverSonic94

6brlp8,Gamer friends turn UGLY jealous of small streamers .. curiousness how I can handle,"I have followed a few streamers over a year now and enjoy them, but have recently see them try to gain subs in ways that made me look or think down on them.

How far is too far and when is it appropriate to report. I have loved this player a long time and they grow steady viewers. But in a hard spot and would enjoy input. I find so many new streamers are being overly spammed in their feeds etc and shouldn't you regs do a better job helping out the ones just starting. It's kind of reverse bullying. And cowardly.

6b5lmi,OBS VST Audio Plugins,"Psynaps here, partnered streamer for 3+ years and stream guide maker. My goal is to inspire you guys to increase the quality of your stream and raise the bar of quality on Twitch. I am motivated to seek out and discover new methods that anyone can use, and share them with you to give us the edge we need to reach our viewers on the internet! I find when I push others to be better, I am also pushing myself, and we all benefit. Also, this is not a huge promo for my video on OBS VSTs, I actually make guides all the time for this very community, and I encourage you to watch other YouTube videos on VSTs, not just mine. That being said, lets get into it!!!

First, let me say I am not an audio engineer, and I never think my own audio sounds perfect so I'm always reaching for a better sound. I get my knowledge from you (the Twitch audio community), audio engineers in Twitch chat and on the internet, and from the results of tests we conduct live on the stream (which makes for amazing, and nerdy discussions we have all the time, which you are invited to be a part of!). The results of these audio experiments are sometimes good and bad, with the ultimate goal to improve and innovate.

So what are VSTs? Think of them like audio plugins that can be used to enhance your voice and audio, and can also be used to add audio effects to your stream.

Why would a streamer want to use them? For lots of reasons, mainly to address the 2 major concerns streamers have: 1.) Background noise, and 2.) audio levels. VSTs include gates, limiters, and compressors (and more) which are commonly used by audio professionals to achieve the ""radio"" or ""broadcast"" voice, and clean up the voice for a professional broadcast sound.

Where do I get VSTs for OBS and how do I use them? There are a TON of free VSTs on the internet, and OBS now lets you load them and apply them to your audio sources. See my video (at the bottom) for a demonstration on how to install them, and where to find the free ones most streamers are using.

After launching my VST video on YouTube, I instantly got a positive response, however there were some concerns, so let me address those here so we can pick up from there. Lets also list additional concerns here too!


1.) You can't use audio mastering VSTs for live mixing. Actually, you can, and some of them work great! Mastering and live mixing (depending on the VST of course) may share the core functions of live voice mixing such as gating, compression, and limiting. I found this to be the case with the VST I am currently testing, Izotope Ozone. Ozone is a premium plugin that is marketed for mastering, but has core live mixing features. I love it so much for live voice, I am currently using it at the time of this post. I suggest people checkout the free alternatives like the ones I present in my video. Don't limit yourself here, listen to your ears and gut. If it sounds good (or better), then you did something right, even if it wasn't by the book!


2.) If you have a hardware compressor, you shouldn't add more VST compressors in the chain. False, you can! In fact this is a technique known by voice professionals as ""serial compression"", or ""compression stacking"". Adding two or more compressors can add a different, and sometimes better effect to the voice compared to doing a single compression. This is interesting, because those of us using hardware compressors (like me) can experiment with additional dynamics processing to get a better, or new sound! You will find many pro references for this by searching ""serial compression"" on google. Very exciting! Caution, if stacking compressors, there is a right and wrong way to do it, but if it sounds good, you are likely on the right track.


3.) Making your voice sound loud using compressors is tacky and annoying. Well I can't disagree with this, there are plenty of ways to make mistakes with VSTs that may make the audio sound bad or amateur (and I know my own audio isn't perfect and always sounds too compressed or loud imo). Care should be taken when playing with these plugins, and feedback from viewers goes a long way! Also remember that broadcasting on Twitch is a somewhat new domain in audio methodology. Most voice guides are focused on vocals in music, or broadcast radio. Yet streamers are faced with the challenge of managing alert sounds, game sounds, background music, voice chat (discord, etc) all while maintaining a clear and enjoyable voice. This might be a challenge even for an audio engineer, yet we do it every day on Twitch! I find taking advantage of that extra headroom (making the voice a little louder, not too much of course) helps to keep the voice clear and audible for the viewers.

Now, when it comes to audio on Twitch, the discussion will get VERY opinionated because there will be audio experts will all levels of expertise, from many professional walks of life. There are also a lot of audio enthusiasts that have an advanced ear for these things, and have insight from their own experiences. Thus, I hope all of you guys to chime in. That enables us to push each other to the next level, and I invite you to keep the discussion constructive and all about pushing each other forward.

I hope this receives you well. Cheers, and good luck out there.

6b0quu,Streamers hate being interrupted by Windows updates but you MIGHT need to REALLY update RIGHT NOW. (x-post /r/pcmasterrace),"We all have seen those clips of streamers having to update mid stream and they're pretty hilarious and what not. Because of these random updates, streamers have tried to find ways to disable updates or to delay them as much as they can. There is a worm worming around that can possibly affect you, please read the following...

/u/TheAppleFreak posted this on /r/PCMasterRace and I will cross post it here (all credit goes to him, check out the original thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6atu62/psa_massive_ransomware_campaign_wcry_is_currently/):



This ransomware looks like it's a nasty piece of work; [large areas of Europe have been impacted by the issue.](https://twitter.com/e55db081d05f58a/status/863067374186090496) The malware exploits the same SMB bug that was used in the leaked NSA tool EternalBlue, which was patched in March 2017 as per [MS17-010](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx). Patching your machines for MS17-010 will do quite a lot to stop the spread of this malware.

For people using the following versions of Windows, make sure you have the following patches installed on your machine:

* Windows XP, Server 2003, and Windows 8 - https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/
* Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 - [KB4012598](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012598)
* Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 - [KB4012212](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012212) (standalone) OR [KB4012215](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012215) (update rollup)

Couldn't find the two things you listed for Windows 7 and freaked the fsck out XD because I couldn't install the updates either. (thanks to /u/MazInger-Z)**

* Windows Server 2012 - [KB4012214](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012214) (standalone) OR [KB4012217](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012217) (update rollup)

Haven't done the research on this yet. 
* Windows 10 (you can check your installed version and build by pressing Win-R and running `winver`)
  * Pre-version 1511 - [KB4012606](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4012606)
  * Version 1511 - [KB4013198](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4013198)
  * Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016 x64 - [KB4013429](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4013429) (OS build 14393.953). **NOTE**: If you have any of the following patches installed, you're good: KB4015438 (14393.969), KB4016635 (14393.970), KB4015217 (14393.1083), and KB4019472 (14393.1198). All of these replace KB4013429.
  * [Version 1703 already has this update](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4016871)

To check if you have the update installed, check the hotfix ID for your OS, then in a command prompt run the command `wmic qfe get hotfixid | find ""$hotfixid""`, where `$hotfixid` is the ID of the update (also the quotes are important!). Make sure that the `KB` is capitalized, otherwise the search will fail. If it is installed, it will return the hotfix ID. If it isn't installed, it will not return anything. **NOTE**: As people have pointed out, monthly update rollups will replace these specific patches. In this case, you can check your Windows update history to make sure that one of the relevant updates was installed at some point previously. 

If you download an update and it's a CAB file, you can install it by running the following command: `start /w dism.exe /Online /Add-Package /PackagePath:C:\Path\To\Downloaded\Update.cab`. Restart when prompted. 

Stay safe, everyone.

6au4cr,Transparent Twitch Chat - customizable userscript that overlays chat over the video,"Hey! I'd like to share a small project I've been working on lately - it's a userscript called Transparent Twitch Chat.

Here's a [screenshot of chat](https://repo.chylex.com/transparent-twitch-chat.png) with default settings, and also a somewhat old screenshot of the [settings dialog](https://repo.chylex.com/transparent-twitch-chat-settings.png) (recently added a global switch and haven't updated the pic yet).

You can download the script from the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/chylex/Transparent-Twitch-Chat), scroll down to the **How to Install** section for an exact guide for your browser.

Made this primarily because watching Twitch with chat on non-ultrawide screens wastes a lot of space, especially on 5:4 where the video becomes tiny. The script only works when you enable **theater** mode (if you want fullscreen, F11 works in most browsers).

I've made it work with other popular addons/scripts like BTTV and FFZ, and it should work fine in most major browsers, but it's hard to test all possible combinations so if you run into an issue, please include your browser and all addons and scripts you have installed.

I've been subbed to a specific channel for 18 months. My last sub purchase was an upgrade to the $24.99 tier. About 2 weeks later, the streamer implemented loyalty badges, but my badge is showing as a new sub. Is this a known issue? Will going back to the $4.99 a month sub correct this?

6ab3es,"State of the Subreddit: 100,000 Redditors bleed purple! We’ve made it to our next subscriber milestone, and we have some big changes to celebrate it!","# Greetings to you all, /r/Twitch!

As the title says, we've finally made it to 100k subscribers. This is an absolutely stunning milestone, and it's a pleasure to be able to write this post. Myself and the other moderators have been working around the clock to prepare some new and exciting changes (some of which you may have already seen). This post will document all of these new changes, and you are all encouraged to give us your feedback in the comments section. Let's get to it!

# New Changes

### CSS
~~You will hopefully have noticed that we now have a brand new CSS theme. It uses the /r/Cogent base theme and there have been some heavy [modifications](http://i.imgur.com/D618I06.jpg) to make it more suited to this subreddit.~~ The following is a brief summary of some of the key changes:

- ~~New link flair icons~~
- ~~[New user flair icons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/wiki/subreddit/flairs)~~
- The sidebar dropdowns have been redesigned and rearranged into more appropriate categories. 
- ~~The header has been turned into sidebars~~
- ~~The links at the top now only have four spaces instead of six~~
- ~~Link flair filters have been fixed~~

As you may already know, Reddit Admins have stated they intend to deprecate CSS customisation for all subreddits. This theme has already been made before the announcement, which is a shame because a lot of time was spent on it. Therefore, we now support the /r/ProCSS subreddit. [You can read more on that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/68b3zx/rtwitch_is_now_supporting_rprocss/);

### Twoos
Encouraging users to post original content and help others has been something difficult for the /r/Twitch Mod Team to do. Today though, we're releasing the Twoos system! The name Twoo comes from our [new icons](http://i.imgur.com/bF8h8Ul.png) used on Twitter/Discord/Twitch. Twoo is short for Twitch Snoo. Twoos are basically points. 

Any user can reply `!nominate` as a reply to a comment or post and the user who posted it will receive 1 Twoo. To ensure this is done properly, the nomination will be sent to an approval queue managed by /r/Twitch Moderators and Community Helpers. If it is rejected, the Twoo will be removed again. 

Moderators and Community Helpers will also award Twoos for helping in the /r/Twitch Discord server or submitting to the wiki. You will also automatically be given them for entering a contest, joining the /r/Twitch Discord server or streaming to the Subreddit Twitch Community (0.25 per 15 minutes).

Of course, a system like this should have its rewards, right? ~~Since the new CSS theme has such a big focus on user flair, we thought it would be good to use that.~~ As you get more Twoos, you will be assigned a more notable flair. Keeping to the Twitch badges, we've decided to use the bits flairs to do this. Also, if you've linked your Discord account to your Reddit account and you're in the /r/Twitch Discord server, you will be given a more distinguished role and username colour. 

To link your Reddit, Twitch and Discord accounts to this system and/or find out more, take a look at http://twoos.twitchdb.tv Twitch Staff, Admins and Global Moderators should modmail us so we can set it to not overwrite your existing flair.

### Rules Changes
We haven't made any major changes to the rules and we haven't changed how we're moderating. The biggest difference is we've split rule #1 so the part about respecting the Twitch Terms of Service and Reddiquette is now it's own rule: 

&gt; VIII. Respect Twitch and Reddit rules.
&gt; *Do not encourage users to break the ToS of Twitch or Reddit. You can read the [Twitch ToS here](https://www.twitch.tv/p/terms-of-service) and [reddiquette here](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Anyone breaking reddiquette will be reported to the admins.*

Also, the term `a news article` has been replaced with `for a permitted purpose` and `via modmail` has been replaced with `via [the requests system](http://requests.twitchdb.tv/)` in rule #3. Plus, the words `there are` were added to rule #4.

### AutoModerator Filters
As a mod team, we're still committed to cutting back on the number of repetitive topics that appear on the subreddit. AutoModerator is an effective tool for doing this, and we're continuing to add to its filters. We have just added a filter to remove posts asking or giving away Prime codes (adding to the existing one for Runescape codes) and posts with basic titles such as `Help`, `Question`, etc.

### TwitchSubreddit Bot
The TwitchSubreddit bot was originally added to the mod list so it could assign flairs for those with a certain number of Twoos. However, as another part of our efforts to reduce repetitive threads, we've also been using it to post threads it found from the search function. Hopefully this will encourage users to look at these past threads and help them recognise that there are a lot of repetitive threads. We understand it was initially unreliable and, following [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/69g7bm/an_attempt_to_cut_back_on_the_number_of/), we have made some changes to improve it. It was good to see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/68stej/thank_you_for_this_glorious_bot/) from a community member to show our efforts are appreciated. It's still a bit buggy and posts irrelevant stuff, but we're continuing to work on it!

### Moderator Application
We're looking for a new junior moderator! A junior moderator is a user who is granted the `flair`, `posts`, `mail` and `wiki` permissions on /r/Twitch, as well as being assigned the moderator flair. Their main roles will be to help answering modmail, removing rule-breaking posts, assigning flairs, and generally keeping this subreddit a fun and useful community.

As the junior moderator becomes experienced and the other mods think they’re ready, they will be granted full permissions. This is how moderators have been added in the past and we’ve found it works fantastically!

~~If you think you’ll be a good moderator of this subreddit, [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed4syIjLXJJj1NkazljRwaKLJuT-LGQ-3sljV3mSL3PgCMKA/viewform)!~~ We hope to announce the results in a week or so.

### New Community Helper
We recently acquired a new Verified Community Helper: /u/MiTurnerMC! We would like to take this opportunity to publicly welcome him to the team and thank him for his efforts so far.

### AMAs
We said in our [90k subscribers State of the Subreddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5u6129/state_of_the_sub_rtwitch_has_now_reached_90k/) that we would be running some AMAs between then and now. We have been able to hold three in this time, so thank you to all the people who ran them and those who asked the questions. They have been a joy to hold and take part in.

### TwitchDB
In recent posts, we have talked a lot about the uncertainty of the future of TwitchDB. We asked /u/distortednet to write a short statement on his plans for the future:
&gt; The current state of TwitchDB is jank, to say the least. I don't have the time needed to dedicate to it. It is an open source project, but if anyone needs to ask to work on it instead of diving in, I don't really have time to deal with that. So it's more that the code is just..there, I guess. I do need to write doc's on setting up a successful dev environment, though.

&gt; In the long term, I do have plans for TwitchDB. I want to play more with the idea of creating a different way to search and discover streams. That's probably way more ambitious than I think, tho. Right now I am not really in a place to do that sorta stuff.

&gt; I will continue to contribute (minimally) to TwitchDB, mostly really critical this site is no longer running type bugs.

For this reason, as well as the introduction of Twoos flairs, we no longer use the /u/twitchdb bot. It has now been removed from the moderators list..

### Wiki
The /r/Twitch Wiki Team has been working to make some changes to the wiki to make it more useful and easier to use. For example, there is now a section for related subreddits. If you have ideas of what you'd like to see, please leave them in the comments or [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTwitch).

### Community Events &amp; Megathreads
We've been planning some upcoming Community Events &amp; Megathreads! Firstly, you may recall that we used to have [Art/Branding Megathreads](https://redd.it/5t3tl6). These served us well, but we now need something to include other services people offer for Twitch users. Therefore, we will soon introduce a Twitch Services Megathread - which will still include artists, but also musicians, moderators, voice actors, editors and more!

We're also now pleased to announce that the Twitch Weekly recap posts will now start to be posted once again by /u/SaaiTV (yes, he's doing something useful for a change... amazing [](#Kappa)). We hope to document these in the wiki too!

As another part of our push on good content, we will now publish monthly recap threads alongside these State of the Subreddit posts that contain:
- Contest Winners
- AMAs
- Top Posts
- Twitch Weekly Recap Posts
- Approved Ads
- Any Important News

To celebrate the milestone of 100k subscribers, we will also be hosting an all time Best of /r/Twitch! For those of you who have not seen a Best Of contest before, there will be five categories where anyone (who isn't the author of the submission and has an account created before this post) can submit a post/comment. The one with most votes in each categories will be the winner! We will discuss this more when the competition is posted in a couple of weeks. 

In addition to all of that, we will also run a Community Q&amp;A in a couple of weeks that will contain questions that new streamers often ask on /r/Twitch. Hopefully, if a sufficient number of people respond, we'll be able to generate some useful statistics for the wiki that will cut back on the number of repetitive threads even more.

And if that *still* wasn’t enough, we’ll now be tweeting out when contest winners are live so you can visit their stream. 

### Discord, Twitch Community &amp; Twitter
Just another reminder that we have a Discord server where you can chat and chill with your fellow community members (nearly 4,000 of them). You can find the details for that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5cly2l/updated_information_for_the_rtwitch_discord_server/).

We also recently opened [a Twitch Community](https://www.twitch.tv/communities/TwitchSubreddit) for the subreddit. You can browse it to find streamers who are fellow Redditors, and stream to it to get viewers who are fellow Redditors. This Community is shown on the sidebar, so it's promoted on /r/Twitch. Don't forget it also gets you Twoos!

Also, just a reminder you can follow us on Twitter at [@TwitchSubreddit](https://twitter.com/TwitchSubreddit) for announcements and interesting discussions. Feel free to tweet us as well, we don't bite!

# bleedPurple
As we come to the end of this post, we thought it would be nice to get some of the past lead moderators to write a sentence or two about the subreddit. 

/u/spla08 (ShannonZKiller)  
&gt; I am SO proud that the r/Twitch community has reached 100k, and to have helped for the time I did in cultivating that growth! This subreddit has always been about giving advice, sharing experiences, and supporting each other in a mutual goal to make Twitch the best place ever - and I know it will always remain that way with the great mod team it has and the awesome community that has formed ❤

/u/distortednet  
&gt; 100K is a massive achievement, and I am happy to see the subreddit is in good hands and has been healthy since leaving. it was not that long ago when it was just half the size. This community has been one of the most incredible things I have ever experienced on the internet, and I’ve been switching 0's and 1's for a long time. The mods of this subreddit work harder than you can possibly imagine. I owe so much to the community, and will keep pushing myself to keep paying that back. Congrats on 100k, it won't be long before this sub is at 200k, [](#PogChamp)

/u/Heep123  
&gt; I'm proud to be able to write this post to celebrate 100k subscribers and bring so many new changes along! Being able to see the subreddit gain 60k subscribers has been an absolute joy, and the connections between the members of this community are something that can only be described as wonderful and unique. I hope I am able to continue to grow the community for a long time, and I'm lucky to have the opportunity to do so with such wonderful people. I wish everyone all the best for the future. Remember to bleedPurple! [](#bleedPurple)

To conclude, we would like to say a big thank you to you all for making /r/Twitch what it is. We wouldn't be here without all 100,000 of you. We hope all these changes will be welcomed and that they make a positive change to the community. We look forward to seeing your feedback and lots of [](#bleedPurple) emotes in the comments!

Until next time, happy streaming and viewing from...

6aahtt,I pretty much exclusively used the 'random' button when browsing to discover new streams; why did twitch take it away?,"There used to be an extra hyperlink on the [browse](https://www.twitch.tv/directory) page on twitch (next to where they have Games, Popular, Creative, Discover) called random, and I would hang out there and keep refreshing until I discovered a stream I liked.

 It was a great way to get exposed to streams big and small, streamers playing all sorts of games, from old school throwbacks to even streamers streaming without putting a game title. Why'd they take away this functionality? We always talk about helping people discover new streams, well this was how I did just that!

I know sometimes we look at viewership surges on a good day and get excited, and then get bummed out when we done see them again, but remember: you are building  a community, you aren't looking to have a huge surges you're looking for a steady swell. Those two, three users that always show up and chat? Talk to them, learn their names, their lives, and appreciate them. This is where  a channel grows. Followers are cool but having those three or four consistent concurrent viewers? That's important. That doesn't mean you can't focus on growth, it's just saying that you should appreciate who enables that growth.

6a2fi6,IRL section moderation,"So what's the staff's modus operandi here? Seems like there's no consistency with respect to actually following ToS and partner contracts. If the rules are so vague that even employees don't know exactly what they are, that means they're void and unenforceable.

69zcjq,Seven Thousand of my Followers Unfollowed,"One year ago my account was permanently banned due to a mistake on Twitch's end under the category of ""Offensive Username"". The problem was cleared up and I got my account back. Yesterday my account was banned for the same reason, and resulted the same way. However, when I got my account back I noticed many people complaining that they had been unfollowed from my channel. 

""Many people"" being specifically seven thousand users. My account was reverted to 1,000 followers, causing friends and viewers of 2 years to unfollow the channel out of nowhere.

This isn't a ""ban"" related post, but rather a report for this bug. I'm not able to get a response back from support.

****

**Edit:** Thanks so much for the support on this. I got in direct contact with a staff member and the loss in following was due to a bot wave ban that had an issue specifically targeting bots.

69ksxo,Basic Safety &amp; Security Tips for Streamers,"In light of all the discussions about privacy lately, I put together [an article](http://www.superphrenic.com/safety-and-security-for-streamers.html) with some tips about improving your online safety.

Here's a brief overview of the main article:

* Maintain basic account security with strong passwords and two-factor authentication

* Don't use your real name (like, *anywhere*)
* Use a new email address for your streaming brand
* Upgrade your PayPal account to a business account
* If you buy your own domain, keep your info out of the WHOIS database (if the privacy option is available in your country)
* **Pick a different birthday (my favorite tip!)**
* When you're sharing stories, be aware of how the information could be cross-referenced to find you (e.g. if you say you live next to a town with the world's biggest spork, you just really narrowed it down!)
* Remove EXIF data and personal information from images
* Don't use the same photo in multiple places (TinEye will catch you!)
* Be careful when integrating IRL friends into your stream. Talk to them about the potential problems of oversharing and make sure they're briefed on internet security for their own sakes
* Consider a P.O. box...but not one in your town (can pinpoint streamers from small towns)
* Devote some time to removing your info from free online databases (Spokeo, Pipl, White Pages, etc.)
* Start now! Even if you already launched your stream, you can still take steps (upgrading your PayPal account, changing your associated emails) to improve your security

This isn't an all-inclusive list of things you can do to protect your privacy as a streamer, but it's a good start. If you *aren't* already doing these things, you really, really should start!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/69ksxo/basic_safety_security_tips_for_streamers/,1494071280.0,240,0.95,57,Twitch,superphrenic

68porc,New twitch style changes,"To me it is terrible. Prime items hidden behind clicking the crown at the top. Which means I will never know when they change and if they get something new since I won't click it.

Recommended channels on the left is stupid. The two I have recommended do not interest me at all. I will also end up unfollowing a lot of the top streams I follow so they don't pollute the ones showing up in the left navigation.

The side navigation also makes it so you gravitate towards the larger streams you follow so you do not have to go back to the following page to see who all is live. They should show 5 random channels that you are following to not make it just the top 5 live. Since if I have stuff like Riot Games, Summit, Soda, Lirik, CSGO/DOTA, they will 100% always be there for me which is stupid.

Overall I think it is a major downgrade and added a bunch of clutter.

EDIT: Oh so the following on the left does absolutely nothing besides showing you the top 5 you follow. You have to click following in the top bar to go back to the channels you are following. What the fuck is the point of the top banner? Move everything there or keep everything in the left navigation. Choose one or the other or we will have like 10 nav bars all over the place and twitch will look like AOL with a bunch of tool bars. You have the giant purple banner at the top, and then when watching a channel you have their giant banner, and then their other nav bar with their image, their clips etc.. The left navigation has now become pointless and I really hope BTTV gives an option to disable it otherwise I will make my own plugin to disable it since there is no need for it anymore.

EDIT2: Why not delete the whole left navigation and make the following channels similar to the prime loot drop down? Cleans up the whole thing a bit. No left navigation, everything contained at the top of the page. Prime loot, notifications, and following all with similar drop downs. Can show some of the top 5 following in the following drop down, or just keep the following button somewhere more intuitive. Right now you have the top 5 channels in the left nav, you have to get to the channels you follow by clicking in the left nav, you have to view prime loot in the upper right, account in the upper right.

68kx2x,My first real month streaming regularly,"So originally I decided back in late 2014 I wanted to start streaming. I am a lifelong gamer (41 years old - gaming since Pong!) and wanted to stream to eventually help support my fiance and infant son. I decided that with our taxes I would get a PC capable of streaming and set out on an adventure through Twitch. I did get my PC but sadly my 19 month old son died March 1, 2015 from his treatment of Leukemia. He had a rare form called JMML and whereas he technically beat it, he could not stand the treatments. We held our beautiful boy in our arms as they pulled him from life support (he was medically induced into a coma). I gave up all hope of anything, let alone streaming. There were times, here and there, I attempted to but my heart just was not into it. Grief when you lose someone you love, especially a child, is hard. Anyhow, I digress...

Fast forward. Its over 2 years later now. I have a gorgeous almost 11 month old daughter. Again, I want to try and help support her and mom. I am a stay at home dad. It is cheaper for me to do this and have my fiance work (she makes better money than I could) than to pay for daycare and have someone we do not know raise our child. I decided to try streaming again at night when my daughter is asleep. For the past 3 weeks I have streamed every night regularly around 6 hours a night. Another somewhat popular streamer decided to raid my channel one night a few weeks ago and since then it has been utter magic. I get between 10 - 30 viewers a night and I have to say it has been the most fun experience I could imagine. I have a blast with my regulars and I usually have to relax a bit after streaming before I can go to sleep because of how much fun I have been having.  I even made affiliate!

I hope to do this for a long time and continue growing. I have had over 75 followers in the last 30 days or so. I hope to get many more. Maybe in a few years I can even make partner and start earning some kind of income from it. It would be quite an accomplishment, I think. If it does not happen, at least I am enjoying myself. Even my fiance has started streaming because she sees how much fun I have with it! 

I just wanted to share this. I feel so happy with the way life is going these days after dealing with such a horrible thing. Thank you guys for taking the time to read this :)

68glhj,[Tutorial] How to Make Video Transitions in OBS,"Hey Guys and Gals.

I saw a post earlier today asking about this and I recently worked on my own stuff just messing around and figuring it all out and wanted to share with the rest of you.

&amp;nbsp;


[How to Make Video Transitions in OBS](https://youtu.be/C56bMk-bMS4)


&amp;nbsp;

MAJOR EDIT TO WINFF APP LINK - https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&amp;id=0B8HoAIi30ZDkZTNHSlZYTU41cWs&amp;export=download

Apparently you need the 64 bit version to get the google presets.  Sorry for the confusion. I've updated the info on the YT video as well.

Basically this tutorial will show you how to create a video file with Alpha Channel (Transparency) that will work as a wipe/transition within OBS every time you change scenes.

&amp;nbsp;

The process using the Stinger Transition plugin is super easy. 

I've used Adobe After Effects to build out what I've got, but I go through the process of converting that video file and then bringing it into OBS and incorporating it into your actual stream.

&amp;nbsp;

You could even use this process to create other stuff, like full screen overlays, alert pop-ups, etc.

&amp;nbsp;


Let me know if you guys like this or have any questions about it. I'm thinking I'll probably do more of these to get people more into the graphics and polish of broadcasting. Would be interesting to see how many people would be wanting more stuff like this.

6886p8,2 years ago - I finally found out how i was hacked. Read my story/advice on how to avoid being a victim,"Around 2 years ago moderating a Twitch channel. I was speaking with close friends on an TeamSpeak Server and someone posted a link in the chat. Curious to what it was while checking it out, coming to find out it was to grab my ip address and sent to the hacker. At first i thought he was attempting to knock my internet out or the broadcaster.

The next day. We were having problems keeping someone banned from the twitch chat and didn't understand how they were getting around the ban. As the trouble continued, coming to found out who was lifting the ban was me (my account) and eventually i was unmoderated by the broadcaster.  

I spoke to Xangold about my account issue and he said the only time my password was changed is around the time i changed it which is when my twitch account was linked to my email at the time and later changed somehow. 

Assuming the old password i used was changed to something different under a different email the hacker used which is why i never received an email about my password changing. 

This wasn't because of a bad password either. 

Twitter messages with Xangold: http://imgur.com/kvBgiK0


Now... exactly how did the hacker manage to gain access to my account? just by giving Twitch Staff/Support my IP Address &amp; who you're subscribed too (which i was subscribed to the broadcaster i was moderating for). That's honestly one way to prove you're the real one to twitch and actually fool them.

According to the hacker himself: http://imgur.com/9xYbeW5


I should be blaming myself for clicking that link and twitch for letting someone have access just by giving them my IP Address &amp; who i'm subbed to on twitch. 

Both of those things can publicly be accessed/seen by anyone. It isn't hard for someone to link/embed an cute kitten image that actually logs your IP address. 

**Take my advice:**

* Use a Proxy/VPN
* Don't click suspicious links/images in chats (especially from people you trust) 
* Use strong different passwords on websites (exp: X#9gY-+CDLosQ55)

I hope twitch will catch on to this and improve their security and how they deal with loss of access to accounts.

67xk1n,"Hey Twitch, thanks for not being YouTube.","Hopefully this doesn't break the ""no call-outs"" rule since YouTube isn't an individual:

In the recent months, with YouTube (once again) completely reworking their business infrastructure without giving any real information to their creators or offering them any support, it makes me really worried about the stability of our beloved content creators. The behavior YouTube is exhibiting makes it pretty clear that major platforms for content creators can do basically anything they want and get away with it. How quickly did we all forget about [YouTube Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh_1966vaIA)?

And yet, at the same time that this is all happening, Twitch and Amazon announce their new affiliate program - which I think we're all excited for. They continue to develop their platform to be mutually beneficial to the wellbeing of content creators, users, and the company itself. I hope I speak for more than myself by saying that the direction Twitch is moving in is reassuring. It undoubtedly helps that the user base of Twitch is a lot more generous with their financial resources than those of YouTube, but that doesn't change the fact that Twitch has made, and continues to make decisions in the name of the community, rather than in the name of advertisers.

67w3tp,"REAPER Microphone Processing (Expanders, Gates, Compressors and Limiters)","**PREFACE**
____

This is an updated version of my tutorial from nearly 2 years ago. I am not an audio engineer but I have dabbled with bedroom music production so I have played around with audio for some time. At the end of the day when it comes to audio, do what sounds right.

I will say that mic positioning, mic type and environment play a huge role in how well your mic will sound. My Audio Technica BP40(Large Diaphragm Dynamic Broadcast) is about 4 inches from my mouth on a RODE PSA-1, the whole rig is roughly on a 45 degree angle to the right of my mouth. 

This angle rotates the pickup of the mic so that I can talk at the monitor and still be talking at the mic. 

Condensers are more sensitive than dynamics, have a higher noise floor but require less gain. Like dynamics, they sound best when close to the source. 

If your mic is on your desk, off a stand, over a foot away this tutorial might not work for you.

[**REAPER Microphone Processing (Expanders, Gates, Compressors and Limiters)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgD2vEgFI8)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgD2vEgFI8

In this video I use Reaper as my DAW/VSThost but the concept is the same for hardware setups and other digital audio software but your plugins may be limited.

•	REAPER, it's lightweight and it's also portable - http://www.reaper.fm/

•	VB-Audio Virtual Cable, free Virtual Audio cable - http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/index.htm

Let me know if you have any questions. I went slow and explained what most things were doing which caused me to run a bit longer.
____

**IMPORTANT**

If you experience any crackling or popping in your audio you may need to increase your sample size in Reaper audio device settings or lower your sample rate.
All plugins used were zero latency, Exclusive Mode (Polled) was used at the end to bring our latency down.

https://www.cantabilesoftware.com/glitchfree/

This book goes over real-time audio and the challenges computers face when trying to do it, the glitches that can occur.

____

Video is linked above and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgD2vEgFI8) but this is the **TL;DW** of it.



•	**Mic gain Pre Fx(Dry)** – Aimed for around -6dB peak, -18 to -12 RMS. This leaves headroom for “acting out” but still gives a strong signal to work with.  You want the most gain in your chain to be from your Pre-amp, get it right at the source and the rest is easier.

Clicking the number at the top of any meter in REAPER resets the peak level it detected, you will be doing this a lot to determine your levels.

•	**Downward Expander** – To eliminate background noise, monitor your noisefloor with the left meter to get a rough idea of where your noise comes in then set your threshold accordingly. 

Expanders lower signals below the threshold at a ratio, a Gate is a type of expander with an Infinite:1 ratio, they expand your dynamic range(the difference between the lowest and highest part of a signal).

    Settings used:
    Threshold: -50dB
    Ratio: 5:1
    Detection: RMS
    Attack: 3ms
    Release: 100ms


•	**ReaComp** – Compressors reduce a signal **above** the threshold at a ratio, compressing your dynamic range. A compressor can normalize your volumes by bringing the lowest and highest parts closer together in volume.

I set up for peak compression to only gain reduce the loudest sounds, manually applied makeup gain to bring my level back to what it was before the compressor. I used the supplied meters to determine my input into the compressor and output to know how much gain to apply. Auto Makeup was not used because it was applying too much gain which introduces noise.  

    Settings used:
    Threshold: -18dB
    Attack: 3ms
    Release: Auto
    Ratio: 6:1
    Knee: 12dB
    RMS Size – 0ms
    Wet Gain: +3 dB (Did not use Auto Makeup)


•	**JS MGA JS Limiter** – A limiter was used to bring my final levels up and hard limit them to -3dB.  The limiter is the only thing adding a significant amount to my overall gain in the whole chain, all my previous gain was done via my pre-amp on the interface, this provides the least amount of noise.

    Settings used:
    Threshold: -4dB
    Release: Default
    Ceiling: -3dB


•	**ReaGate** – Plugged in-between the Compressor and Limiter, I used the gate to shape the volume envelope of the compressor. I could have very well had no Gate but my keyboard would get annoying. 

Because it wasn’t being used for background “noise”, it was placed after the compressor. Normally you put a Gate before the compressor but you technically don’t need to, it’s a tool with a specific purpose, do what sounds right.

    Settings used:
    Threshold -36db
    Attack – 75ms (I demonstrate why in the video)
    Hold – 300ms
    Release – 100ms
    Lowpass – 8000hz (Keyboard clicks)
    Highpass – 300hz (Desk bumps)
    RMS Size – 15ms (Averaged Input detection)
    Dry: -24dB (Gate is shaping the compressors sound, so I’m letting some of the original signal back in instead of completely shutting it off)

____
**EQing** - You'll want to do your cuts and boosts early, preferably in the beginning of the chain. EQing is on a per mic/per person basis so my cuts and boosts are for my own voice through my BP40. I'll provide an image of my EQ as an example but know that it's for my voice.

http://imgur.com/1UVJHa3

•	**ReaEQ** – If your mic or mixer has a high pass filter switch use it. If it doesn’t, apply a 100Hz Highpass filter with a lower bandwidth to bring the top of the curve back to 0. Highpassing gets rid of low frequency noise/rumbles and cleans up distracting frequencies from lower voices that tend to muddy up the sound. The rest of the EQing is up to your mic and voice.

* For males, 300-350hz can be a ""muddiness"" zone so I have applied a wider but small cut to that area. 
* I applied a wide boost to 500-2000hz to add some mids.
* I applied a VERY narrow notch to a specific frequency of electrical noise I was hearing.
* Another small cut to my sillabance range
* A high shelf to add some ""air"" and then a simple Low Pass to cut out anything past 16000hz

677tye,"Twitch affiliate complainers, click here","So I've been digging around a bit to try to grasp exactly why SOME partnered streamers are upset over this new program. I really would like to understand why they have complaints. To save some time, I'm going to list a few of the dozens of complaints I've seen and some responses. Help me understand here what I'm missing?

""I'm going to lose subs to smaller streamers!"" 
No, probably not. Getting a sub button doesn't make smaller streamers suddenly better, or more worthy of a sub. It won't get people more donations, nor will it suddenly boost their numbers and steal your viewers. How could it possibly? Do you really think your fan base will scatter to the wind, spending their money elsewhere after supporting you all this time? Its not going to happen. You're ok.

""Now being partnered is pointless! Everything I worked so hard for is going to be freely given to everyone practically!""
So? People have had the ability to donate to streamers of all sizes for years. Did your donations drop when streamlabs released a donation system? Even paypal buttons have been available since before twitch was in existence, so the entire time you've been streaming people have had the ability to spend their money elsewhere. Calm down, its not going to hurt you.

""I worked for years to become partnered! Now I'm not special!"" 
Hate to break it to ya, you never were. There are so many people on twitch streaming, that unless you're one of the top few, you're likely just another entertaining person who worked hard to develop a solid fan base. You met the right people, got the right hosts, got in the right communities, made the right  friends, played the game to get partnered, and now you are and you feel amazing! Thats cool, and congrats. But don't forget you're not the only one who put in 70 hour weeks for a year, putting content on youtube, posting on the twitters, doing the stuffs on the discords, and gaining that following. Do you really feel that you do that much different between before you got partnered, and after? Remember how you were a year before you got partnered. You have it now, which means you likely deserved it then given that you were the same person you were then that you are now. So that said, there are many people who are potential future partners who are not yet partnered, and they matter too. They will be right up there with ya someday anyway. Stop acting like you didnt come from the gutter too. Don't forget your roots.

All that said, I want to add that there is not a finite amount of money on twitch; it is growing. Thus, the money is growing. Twitch is a business, and for years theyve been limiting themselves and their income by only soaking up portions of subs, and most recently bits, from a very limited selection of streamers. I've argued for at least 6 months for everyone to get these benefits, and in a way I feel validated that twitch finally listened. If they can make a penny from a million smaller streamers, they make 100k extra this year, why the hell wouldnt they have done this years ago? To think that partnership is about elitism is just wrong. its about money, and the potential to make money. I don't think everyone should be partnered. In fact, I think quite a few less people should be partnered. Basing it off viewership is a horrible measure of content quality, as many people that I know of have simply linked up with a partnered streamer for a month to boost their numbers and gotten partnered, subsequently falling back to their normal 20-30 viewers. Its easy to game the system, so its not all that special to be partnered. 

Nor is being partnered making it in any sense of the word, unless you can live off those 100 subs (250 a month, i wanna know what your rent is like if you can 'make it' off that!) and all partnered streamers know this already. So what's the issue? Help me out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/677tye/twitch_affiliate_complainers_click_here/,1493022856.0,50,0.86,59,Twitch,cconeus
676x22,I've streamed ~10hrs/Day for two weeks now after having a mental breakdown and quitting my job. This is what I've learned.,"Hi, I'm Sadomi. I streamed back in the day in 2010-2011 when Streaming wasn't even a thing really. Wish I stuck with it, but life didn't allow me the chance. Next thing I knew, 6 Years later, I dropped out of college, Worked full time, had a mental breakdown at work. Seriously considered suicide. Quit on the spot, Then decided to Stream all day again. I started with zero, and so far with about 2 weeks of Streaming, I've gotten a lot of new friends, and my stream is my new full time focus. One of my Mods actually bought me a Pizza today. I don't have a job so I'm tight as hell on money, so this was an amazing gesture. 
This post is mostly for me, to be honest. 

&amp;nbsp;




1. Streaming is 25% playing video games. 50% engagement, 25% Technical difficulties, 100% Effort.
&amp;nbsp;

2. I understand what love is now. It's not being excited about it all the time. It's being comfortable around someone or something. I don't get the same excitement when I play Rocket League. But I still enjoy it. I can still play it everyday, no problem. But im no longer infatuated with it. But if i didn't play Rocket League for a week, I'd probably freak out.


3. People on the internet are jerks.


4. People on the internet are some of the nicest, most amazing people in the world.


5. People are more real and direct with you then in the real world. This can be good.


6. Physical activity is SO IMPORTANT for everyday living.


7. Rome wasn't built in a day. 


8. You need help if you have big aspirations. Don't be afraid to ask for help.


9. Networking is important. But don't ever network. Make friends and be active, don't be shy behind your name!


10. Video games can be so much fun.


11. Video games can suck your soul away from you.


12. Twitch and Youtube are both so Saturated at the lower levels.


13. This is a Snowball Effect game. (Just from my personnel research.)


14. Gaming community is extremely eccentric, vulgar, and uncaring. Be yourself and do what you like, and you'll have fun.

15. Take a break. No, really, take a break. Go sit outside and eat a whole rotisserie  chicken, masturbate, shower, do something by yourself with no stimulation, it helps.

16. If you're viewers support you, support them. Be there when you say you are. No one, and I mean NO ONE has to even VISIT your channel. AT ALL. They want to be there for some reason. They are very forgiving (At least mine are) and MOST realize you are human.

&amp;nbsp;

Streaming has been good for getting my head back into a right state of mind. I''ll keep streaming no matter what, it's more work than anything I've ever done before in my life, but I've never felt so satisfied. 

I love you, Twitch Community. I really do.

67441z,Is it hard to earn a living livestreaming on Twitch?,"I answered this question on Quora, and expanded it more into my Twitch story. My username on Twitch was ""AnarchyAo"". I was known for being the first rank 50 in Tribes: Ascend. My story is long, but if you're interested in livestreaming and growing your brand, then the details of my story might be interesting to you. Enjoy!


I began broadcasting in February 2012 (several months before Tribes: Ascend was released in April 2012) and spent most of my time playing Tribes: Ascend with no camera and my music playing loud. Due to the lack of streams, people began to watch because the game was in the beta at the time.


I didn’t realize it at the time, but Hi-Rez Studios began negotiating promotional pushes for Tribes: Ascend on Twitch’s front page. I would frequently have my stream put on the front page of Twitch and I was also given the privilege of applying for Partnership and being accepted into the partner program without having the required amount of concurrent viewers.


For a solid 9 months I was streaming Tribes: Ascend and was the first person to hit rank 50 (max rank in the game). I became a well known person in the Tribes community and Hi-Rez Studios noticed. They invited me to help set up their booth at PAX Prime (Seattle, WA) in Fall 2012.


By this point I was earning a few hundred dollars per month streaming and living in my own apartment (with my parent’s supporting me, buying my groceries, paying my rent and constantly being on my case about getting a ‘real’ job). I think at this time in my life I was quite depressed and was using the livestreaming as a device to get my social fix. I also felt that I deserved to have a job that I enjoyed doing… hindsight, I don’t think I deserved anything because my expectations were unreasonable.


At PAX Prime in Seattle, Hi-Rez paid for everything. My hotel, flight, etc and I was able to meet a lot of cool people that worked for the company. Before meeting me, they just knew me as the guy playing their game 16 hours a day and live-streaming it.

I went back home to Virginia after the event, and was given an offer to be a contracted streamed for Hi-Rez Studios, streaming their game on their channel on a (scheduled) weekly basis (approximately 4 hours per day) and being paid an hourly rate ($18 / hour).


I did this streaming for Hi-Rez and promoted their game during major patch releases. I wanted more hours but Hi-Rez was investing in a new game, a MOBA called SMITE. I was afraid that the future of my Tribes streaming would have its hours cut down, or eliminated altogether.


I asked to be added to Hi-Rez's SMITE game live streaming schedule. Their Chief Operating Officer, Nabil asked me how I would provide them with value playing SMITE, when I have no experience playing MOBAs. There was well-known friction between the Tribes and SMITE community (Tribes players claimed Hi-Rez neglected Tribes because SMITE was hogging their developer resources).


I told Hi-Rez I would bridge the gap between the two fan bases of their top two games. I explained that, being the first rank 50 Tribes: Ascend player, simply giving SMITE a chance on stream would open up the Tribes fans to playing SMITE with me. And the SMITE fans that would watch me and start to like me would understand that I'm a Tribes player, and I'm playing their favorite game SMITE, so maybe they should try playing Tribes. After hearing my perspective, Nabil was happy to add me to the SMITE game channel, effectively increasing the hours that I was paid each week to live stream their games.


At this time, I wasn't earning money from my personal channel (despite being a Partner). So when I wasn't streaming for Hi-Rez on their official channel, then I was simply live-streaming Tribes: Ascend on my personal channel to 50 concurrent viewers. I had little to no income being derived from my personal channel because the hype of Tribes: Ascend and it's launch had worn off (it had been a year and a half since it's release, and less people were playing the game).


Several of my viewers suggested I play League of Legends. I had never played a MOBA until SMITE, but SMITE was very different and I had no idea how to play League. I was afraid to start playing LoL on my personal channel because Tribes players hate other games, especially MOBAs and I didn't want to lose my original fanbase that had been dedicated to me for so long.


I decided to give it a shot any way, because I wanted to see if I could garner more viewers. I was successfully streaming to thousands of people for Hi-Rez on SMITE's channel and my concurrent viewers were competitive with their pro SMITE players streaming for them (cadburry and sooner).


So I began streaming League of Legends on my personal channel in June 2013. Several times while streaming League in my first two weeks, my concurrent view count skyrocketed for unexplained reasons. The most concurrent viewers I reached was around 3,800 viewers watching. Some of my viewers at the time attributed this to my title (Bronze V Ranked Games with AnarchyAo) mixed with popular streamers going offline while I was livestreaming (I frequently streamed from 9pm EST to 9am EST, all night (because it had good coverage across all timezones).


After reaching this level of popularity, I applied for a subscribe button ($5 per month, split 50% with Twitch… so I earned $2.50 per month per subscribed user). Within a few weeks of getting a subscribe button, I had an additional revenue stream of $500 per month.


Meanwhile I was running ads against 2k to 3k concurrent viewers and earning a steady income, this supplemented by my pay on Hi-Rez Studios channel schedule was providing me a reasonable income. I would stream 9 to 12 hours a day and was earning around $3,500 per month (on average).


Soon after my popularity taking off in League of Legends, I was invited in Summer 2013 to join a professional NA LCS team (Team Vulcun). The owner at the time, Ali told me that he liked my stream and felt I would connect well with their pro eSports team’s fanbase because they currently needed a solid, personable connection to their fans as the pro players weren’t as relatable (in skillset) to the casual viewers / fans of their team, and they were focused more on playing well and less on viewer entertainment.


I joined Team Vulcun and 10% of my earnings would go to them, but they would promote me and provide me with marketing across all of their social media outlets and allow me access to joining them at in-person events at no cost to me.


This steady stream of income and streaming only lasted several months. I was banned from Twitch in September 2013 after being warned several times. I was streaming non-gaming content between matches (walking down street to buy a donut, using skype to stream an apartment tour) and I was very sarcastic / edgy (my opinions and what I said to people could be construed as offensive, but I felt this was vital to my success as a unique personality that people respected because of my candidness).


After being banned and appealing, the CEO of Twitch (Emmett Shear) said that the ban would stick and I could re-apply for appeal in a year. As a result of my ban, Hi-Rez Studios had to cut ties with me, as they didn’t want to disrespect Twitch’s decision and allow me on their channel (the ban was limited to my channel, but they didn’t want to appear disrespectful to Twitch’s decision).

As a result of my ban, I couldn’t stream again on Twitch. I reached out to Ustream and asked about encoding options (different resolutions) and other Partner program perks. They replied that their not in the business of partnering with streamers like Twitch does.


Ustream was intrigued by my connection to the Gaming industry and eSports scene. I spoke with several of their sales people on gchat for a few months and got to know them that way. I spoke with one sales executive at Ustream every day during this time.


When I joined Team Vulcun, I was told by Ali to contact their primary sponsor, TechBargains (a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, a media company that owns IGN and PC Magazine) point of contact, a guy by the name of Marshall. I spoke with Marshall on Skype and he gave me the background images and other assets required to put on my channel to advertise TechBargains (Vulcun received money contributions from TechBargains to name their selves Vulcun TechBargains and to advertise on each of their team members Twitch pages).


Marshall worked for Ziff Davis, and owned the relationship between TechBargains and Team Vulcun. I kept in touch with Marshall on a daily basis as well, and spoke with him and Ustream each day. At this time, I was still out of work (I couldn't live stream) and was occasionally streaming on Ustream but only had 20 concurrent viewers with no ad revenue or sponsorship.


Marshall went on to purchase the Team Vulcun organization from the former owner, Ali (the guy who invited me to join the team as a live streamer). Marshall was now the owner of Team Vulcun, and he changed it’s name to XDG Gaming.


I told my friend (now owner of Team Vulcun) about about my interactions with Ustream and their interest in eSports. He found this interesting and offered me several floor seats to the League of Legends NA LCS tournament at the Staples center in Los Angeles, CA.


I invited two of sales executives over at Ustream to join me at the tournament and that I would introduce them to various key people in Gaming / eSports (by way of my friend who owned XDG Gaming organization, he offered to provide introductions for me).


My friend who owned XDG Gaming also paid for my flight (I told him I’d pay him back, and I later did) because I couldn’t afford to pay for it with me not having a job and rent being due.


I flew out for 2 days and spent time with UStream and my friend. I then came back home and spent another 6 months not streaming, with no income and having my parents pay my bills (buy my groceries, pay my rent, etc).


I was a college dropout with $20k in debt and no college degree. It was 2013 and I was 26 years old. I had graduated High School in 2005. Failed through community college for 4 years. I had even spent tuition money given to me in 2012 by my parents to attend James Madison University but instead I gave the check to my school, and dropped my classes then spent all the money on a new live streaming set up.


I put everything into livestreaming and had nothing to show for it. I lost it all.

But I caught a lucky break. My networking and persistence began to show signs of paying off. The guys over at Ustream wanted me to work for them in their sales department to help sell their live video platform into the Gaming and eSports markets.


After returning from the League NA LCS Worlds tournament in Fall 2013, I received an offer for a sales job at Ustream in March 2014. I relocated from Harrisonburg, VA to San Francisco, CA and I’ve been here ever since.



It’s been several years since all of this happened, and I was eventually laid off at Ustream due to performance issues. I went on to work in sales for a big data company in San Jose, CA called Hortonworks. I left Hortonworks and joined Fastly (a tech startup in San Francisco that sells a Content Delivery Network platform) in September 2015.


I'm still working at Fastly and I've steadily raised my yearly pay on each of my W2's since moving out to SF. Ustream in 2014, I earned $60k. Hortonworks in 2015 I made $90k. And last year at Fastly I brought home $138k.

Some advice I can provide up and coming streamers… it’s all about the viewer experience and this can be satisfied in more than one way (high interaction, high skill). No one way is right or better, they’re just different.


I enjoyed streaming. I loved the people. They were rude and mean but I’m very negative and sarcastic, and I thrived in the harsh environment of live streaming on the Internet.


Here's some advice based on my experience:


1) Go outside. Maintain a social network in real-life. Use your internet connections to your advantage in the real-life world.


2) Stay humble. People will always want YOUR attention. Don’t let this go to your head. You aren’t special because people are watching you. They’re watching you because you’re streaming and they aren’t and the viewers consider you their friend.


3) Effectively market yourself. Be consistent with the times you’re live streaming and the username you're using across all social media outlets. The more you stream, the better. But there’s also a delicate balance. You don’t want to stream when you’re tired because people will remember you as being the guy who doesn’t talk while playing games. Make sure you’re always ready to be the best at what you do, every time you’re streaming. New people come and go. You want them to come more than they go.


4) Don't hate. Befriend other streamers, and the people you work for. This was a hard lesson learned by me. Even if you think you're right and they're wrong, don't hate on the people who employ you (Twitch) and don't hate on anyone in your industry (other streamers, game publishers, developers or the games they passionately create for you and others).


You create opportunities by connecting with people and networking. Be everyone's friend, and they'll be yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/67441z/is_it_hard_to_earn_a_living_livestreaming_on/,1492975151.0,152,0.78,80,Twitch,ashifflett

66hbz9,Big announcement for small-medium streamers coming at end of month.,"Hello friends.  I had a Twitch staff member watching my stream for a while last night, and my viewers jokingly suggested that he should hook me up with a sub button.  The conversation turned to what I felt was a huge issue with partnership: the fact that it focused so much on raw viewership and not how well-rounded a streamer is (content creation outside of Twitch, a YT, community within the stream itself, etc.)  

The Twitch staff wouldn't spill much but he did note that stay tuned for a big announcement at the end of the month that's geared very much towards improving that experience of small-to-medium sized streamers.

I don't feel guilty sharing this as it was by no means shared with me in a private capacity.

664jqo,"I have an AI that can accurately predict who will subscribe to a streamer, before they do it.","I know it sounds a little crazy, but it is 100% possible. And from my testing, it appears to be roughly 80% accurate within two weeks (I'm still trying to teach the AI how to delineate between subs and donations, donations may not be possible with current data sets). 

It's been tested in six medium-sized channels (750 - 2500 viewers), anonymously. After the first week, the accuracy of the AI has been that it can predict between 40%-70% of the time who will subscribe. After the second week, it can predict between 75%-85% who will subscribe. 

The AI ONLY works for viewers who actively chat, it needs around 3,000 words to form an accurate (88%) profile of a viewer. This is why it takes about two weeks in a channel to get to peak efficiency.

I am posting because I am curious as to what everyone thinks about it, whether you are a streamer or a viewer. I am playing with the idea of monetizing it for streamers, but it would be fairly expensive so it's hard to say that anyone would be willing to pay for it. 

Let me know your thoughts and questions! :)

UPDATE: April 19, 2017
I have received an immense amount of feedback and support on and off of this thread. Thanks everyone!

I have decided that I am going to start testing this in a live environment within the next few days, so I can start building out an auxiliary tool for broadcasters to make actionable decisions based off the data (for instance, showing you Viewer A has an 76% chance to sub, then giving you ways to engage with them to hopefully convert them over). It's important to note that there is never a 100% method to predict ANYTHING that people will do, especially anonymously over the internet (that would be magic). That's why this service is being built to show the likelihood of a viewer subscribing, it will still be up to the broadcaster to engage with, or otherwise convince, that viewer in order to convert them. Apologies if I made it seem like it was a guarantee!

If you are interested in being a part of the beta, or want to just provide your feedback, feel free to visit our website (streamerinsights.com).

6568r4,This is for new growing streamers,"This is going to be a short tip for small streamers just like me. 

GET INVOLVED. I hate seeing streamers that don't interact with the community. Go watch someone on twitch with the same amount of viewers as you and watch their stream. Make friends, and help them grow! This will help you grow as well because they might lend a hand to you as well. By all means do not go around advertising your stream to other streamer, just enter their channel and chat with them. Don't even mention that you stream, just be friendly. They'll eventually figure out you stream too. Become friends with the streamers that have also similar interests as you, maybe even stream the same game as you. You have no idea how happy you will make another streamer by popping into their empty channel and saying hi!

64wxlh,How Streaming helps with my mental issues.,"So i suffer from ADD (ADHD) and Depressions.  
  
It hits me so hard that i usually have many months out of a year, where i lock myself inside my apartment, and i just spend all day watching streams. Not even able to make myself play all the awesome games i love.  
  
It is a shitty life when you can't even motivate yourself to play the games you love.  
  
So i decided a month and a half ago to start streaming, to kinda force myself to play games i enjoy.  
  
And it worked. I am now playing games 5 days a week, and i'm hanging out with some awesome people in my channel. 200+ followers and 7 paying subscribers on gamewisp.  
  
Today is the first day where i truly feel improvement. Until now, it has been making me happy to stream, and today i'm implementing a new personal schedule for my life. And that is all because the streaming and socialization of twitch is helping motivate me.  
  
And i see alot of people on twitch suffering like i am, and they are all being helped by streaming. Using it as an outlet.  
  
So to those of you who have issues, be open about them. Talk about them. People are alot more accepting than you think.  
  
I just want to thank the twitch community, especially the Star citizen twitch community for being so awesome.

64vzbm,The new UI will probably hurt channels with smaller view counts.,"Aesthetics opinions aside. I really dislike the fact that the side bar only displays the top 5 channels you follow. This change will seemingly promote bigger channels and hurt smaller ones. I understand you can still go to your following tab or you can click load more channels on the bar itself but why?

They added an extra step that wasn't there before. I think they are trying to push the friends feature on twitch. Which is probably why it takes over half the side bar now(I have 0 friends added on twitch but this is still the case). But shouldn't the priority be to get you to watch a stream and not to ""chat with friends"". I use twitch to watch streams. I have 10 other ways to chat with friends. I get they want to promote a new feature but I think this makes the user experience worse and might actively cost smaller channels viewers.

Maybe I am overthinking it. People can probably get used to going to their following tab and whatnot. But in my opinion they shouldn't make old features harder to use to promote new ones.

64vmd6,From a UI/UX perspective the new layout is awful. Here's why...,"[This is a picture comparing the new Twitch layout to one of their competitors, Beam.](http://imgur.com/a/merUO)  This is not a promotion of Beam by any means, but is simply to illustrate good, intuitive UI/UX vs Twitch which seems to use the ""cram it in there"" approach, starting with...

**The Top Bar**

Or I should say ""top bars"", because now there are two of them when you're watching a stream.  This new purple bar contains a lot of information, but honestly, this bar on it's own is not that bad.  It's a one stop shop for most things you need to access on Twitch (except for followed/subbed channels), and it looks fairly clean.  The problem really lies in... everything else.  

**Channel Bar**

Channel information still has it's own info bar, that is now snugged up under the purple one which instantly looks messy, especially if you still run in to [this issue](http://i.imgur.com/njATXl6.png) where your page becomes slightly out of alignment because of the hidden banner that's still there for some reason.  This channel bar also contains information which appears in multiple locations which is completely unnecessary.  [If you're watching a channel that you follow, the name, icon, or some combo of the two, will appear *four* times on this page, sometimes more](http://i.imgur.com/tGw7Bxc.jpg) (red circles).  Which leads us in to the...

**Side Bar**

Followed streams are listed down the left literally less than an inch away from the ""Following"" page link in the top bar.  It also serves to display duplicate information such as viewer count and game title (blue and yellow circles respectively).  And yes, I know you can 
minimize the left bar but if you do that it basically becomes useless unless you're really good and remembering icons, but even still, you can't see any stream information for people you follow unless you have it open, or go to the ""Following"" page right above it.  Plus, as far as I can tell the channel information does not update in real time (seems to refresh every couple of minutes), so in order to even get updated information as to who is and isn't live, see what people are playing, or see the titles at all, you *have* to go to the following page.  When the left bar is expanded, the deluge of text, images, red dots, and numbers is painful to look at.  Partner that up with chat on the right and it's an onslaught on the eyes to look at your website.  


So basically, Twitch's approach with this new layout was to not make things any easier, but to simply cram more information in to one place.  Now, going back to the first image, compare this to Beam.  Everything you need is in one bar at the top of the page.  Beam info, channel info, real time viewer counts and page views, notifications, followed channels (not pictured, but it's there in the form of a popout on the right side of the page), and profile information all in one clean place.  

I love Twitch and am by no means trying to make the argument to jump ship.  This is simply meant to be constructive criticism from someone who works very close to people in web dev and graphic design.  Twitch, I love you because you're always trying to innovate and I hope this is just a stepping stone for better things to come.

Like the title suggested [Twitch Fullscreen Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-fullscreen-plus/jbbmdehmiclndmeedcocofcjlpgjnmea) is a free chrome extensions that adds the twitch chat overlay on top of the stream in full screen, it lets you enjoy the full size of your screen while adding the 'twitch chat' entertainment. 

Features:
you can Resize it, drag it, change the chat opacity or just change the background color alpha, you can use the ""slim mode"" which removes all unnecessary UI for maximizing chat experience etc... and of course I plan to add more.

background:
I am a long time twitch viewer and one day while watching on my living room TV I figured it could be really cool having the twitch chat on top of full screen view to save lots of space and really take advantage of the big screen without the need of compromising video size for the chat.

And so, I developed for myself an extension that would do just that, add the chat overlay on top of the full screen view, obviously just adding it wasn't enough, I had to add many featured to make it actually work, like Resizing and dragging it, changing the chat opacity or the background alpha etc...

and it worked great!

After a while I figured I should probably release it because it might be useful for others who might enjoy it. now I am a one man show here, its a learning process, it will always be in development and the QA I can do on the extension is limited as I am a working man, but I do try and add all requested features and fix bugs asap.

Last week I released v1.3.0 of the extensions which included a couple of new features which you can read about [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TwitchFullscreenPlus/comments/63zju9/version_130_is_now_live/). 

I am having a hard time to spread it around, mostly because I don't know where, advertising this goes against most subreddits rules, so if any mods are reading this and you think it might be relevant for your community let me know, or just post it yourself, free karma.

Also if you have any questions, issues or suggestions I will be more then happy to try and help.

Also Thank you twitch mods for approving this message :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/64qin7/twitch_fullscreen_plus_a_chrome_extensions_that/,1491913841.0,124,0.99,35,Twitch,Get_or_get_got

64j82h,For people thinking about streaming,"This is for everyone that might be thinking to stream soon! 

1. I highly recommend you guys to first to see if you have the time in your schedule to be able to stream 3+ hours a day. If your schedule does not meet this criteria, it will be a hard road for your twitch growth.

2. Make sure that your console/PC can stream! PS4 can broadcast from the actual console itself. Xbox I think can also do it. PC you need to make sure that you have a good graphics card and a great Processor to be able to handle the actual game running and your streaming software like OBS or Xsplit.

3. Know that you are going to be talking to an empty room for the first couple of days or months. It will get frustrating and quite awkward but you can get through it. Learn to talk about the game your playing or talk about your day, work or anything that comes to mind. Keep those awkward silences out!

4. Be prepared to trolls coming into your channel and being trolls. Use that ban hammer for anyone that might be trolling or being immature in your chat, it's easier to ban and forget about it than trying to give them attention.

5. Know that this isn't a ""get rich quick"". If you are looking as streaming as your primary way of getting money, be prepared to be slapped right in the face with reality. There are very few channels that can make streaming a full time job, and even for them, it took them years to get to that point. You need to put in the effort before even thinking about donations and subs.

6. BE SOCIAL. Twitch is all about building a community. Link all your social accounts and spread the word about your channel! Be discreet about it, but share it! 

7. Talk to other streamers! Remember, you aren't the only one trying to stream! Interact with other streamers and help them! Helping other streamers can help you because they can help you grow. Make friends and grow together!

8. Don't try to act like someone that you aren't on stream. Be yourself. Viewers will notice when you are ""acting"" and when you are being ""real"". 

9. Get a bot for your channel to help you moderate. Nightbot and Moobot are the most common bots. There are tons of bots out there for you to experiment with like anhkbot, Revlobot and Wizebot. I suggest you find the best one of your liking and experiment with it!

10. Moderators. This can be a double edged sword for you. They can help you or harm you so choose wisely. Pick a viewer,family member, or a friend that you trust to moderate your channel. Moderation is very important to channels that are starting to more chat growth. They can help you get rid of trolls and keep the chat clean.

*bonus tip* once you have established your community and viewers are coming in. Create a brand for yourself. Make yourself stand out, get overlays, make yourself unique. In my channel, my community is called the ""Critical Army"" and my donators are promoted to Army generals. My viewers love it. Create something unique!

Best of luck to all of you and hope to see you streaming along side me!

Sometimes a streamer starts while I'm doing something and I come into the stream an hour into it, and I want to watch from the beginning so I don't miss anything without waiting a day for the VOD (I usually do this with Vinesauce, I hate missing BotW).

641uk7,"[PSA] Twitch appears to use a popular gaming payment processor, Xsolla, which has started adding a default 18% ""tip"" to all payments which it keeps","**EDIT: It appears that this ""tip"" has been disabled by Twitch for subscriptions via Xsolla, I can't see any confirmation it's been disabled for any other Twitch purchases routed through Xsolla though (if there even is anything else you can buy on Twitch through Xsolla).**

---

The larger /r/games thread is [located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/63zewd/popular_gaming_payment_processor_xsolla_has/), with more details.

I'm not up-to-date with any the details really, but it might be something to look out for on your bank statements if you're paying for anything on Twitch and making sure that it's for the amount that you agreed upon. Some people are reporting that the 'tip' might show up as a separate charge rather than it being lumped with the main purchase.

Here's the main rundown from the other thread:

&gt;**Background info:**  

&gt;Xsolla is a popular payment processor to accept payments via a myriad of payment methods.
They are used by Twitch, Steam, Nexon, Ubisoft, and more.

&gt;**Tips by default:**

&gt;As first mentioned [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/63e42m/psa_be_careful_when_buying_gold_there_is_a_new/), Xsolla has started to include a ""Tip"" to themselves by default for all payments.
If you're not careful you could end up being charged extra for no benefit.

&gt;This is a move by pure greed by Xsolla, [they already take a 5% fee in addition to any payment system fees.](https://xsolla.com/pricing/).

&gt;This being a default option tells me they are relying on users not noticing and not bothering to ask for a refund.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/641uk7/psa_twitch_appears_to_use_a_popular_gaming/,1491586407.0,305,0.91,43,Twitch,bluesatin

I now started streaming in Danish, and i stream mostly CS:GO

I used to be around 5-10 viewers doing this in english on a good day.


Now i post PR videos in 2 big danish CS:GO groups. The video i did yesterday got 39 likes and 29 comments with amazing feedback. I started out playing PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND with a steady 40-50 viewers for 2 hours or so. It was amazing. I was the Danish streamer with the highest amount of viewers playing that game at the moment. I even get hosted by huge Danish streamers now.


I went from getting 5-10 followers per day to getting 30-50 followers per day rapidly growing!

63cw93,Just finished my first stream in years,"I forgot how much fun this could be.

I used to stream way back when (2010-2011). It was a pain in the ass to do it then, and I found it was much easier to get viewers back then than it is now. But because I'm now an adult with a full time job, I can properly stream again.


In the stream tonight,
* 20 different people over 5 hours of streaming.

* The Minute Persona 5 was unlocked, someone spoiled the ending (didn't really read it though)

* Remembered I like to be silly and the more I interacted with my audience (mainly my one friend who also loves the game and is one of my homies) the more immersed I get into the game.

* Found a new favorite game.


I've been feeling very lonely these past few months, so playing games with friends and being the center of attention made me happy again. It's 4:30am and I'm still wide awake. I need to stream again soon! Maybe Rocket League as well? Haha


TL:DR I love streaming and I'm so happy I can do it again!

634hyw,With the new Bitrate options you can improve video quality while decreasing CPU Usage in OBS,"Earlier today I saw a post regarding NVENC being a viable solution with the new bitrates. NVENC was always seen as a poor quality alternative for people with bad CPUs, however, with the new bit rate options it is a whole new game. I have been testing settings all day and (my pc is an intel 4790K processor and an nvidia 970) and with this I am able to improve the visual look of my stream while also cutting cpu so my games run smoother (I play a lot of H1Z1, Pubg, CSGO, etc). This is a rare win/win situation. The only catch that I have found is you need to make sure have have a good enough upload to do so, otherwise the 5-6k bitrate won't be possible. I ran my stream today with no issues and could not be happier (you can see the quality in my latest VOD)

62ev7n,"Expanding Your Reach as a Streamer, The Right Way","Let's face it. As Twitch grows, it's getting harder and harder to get noticed and to grow your stream's viewer base. 

There’s a lot of unnoticed potential on Twitch, and the only way to get around the consequence of Twitch’s growth is to be smart and methodical in how you conduct the business of streaming.

So in this post, I’m going to detail some ways that you guys can spread your name and grow your community in a viable, legitimate, and non-spammy way.

We'll start with my favorite: Twitter. 

# Twitter

Using Twitter correctly has the power to not only bring back viewers who have been in your stream before, but also spread your name and reach new audiences who would’ve never heard about you in the first place.

As a broadcaster it’s important that you are cross promoting your social media accounts wherever you can.

This means that it’s a good idea to have a link in your Twitch info section leading viewers to follow you on Twitter, having a social media banner that pops up on your stream every so often, and shouting out your Twitter account at the ends of your broadcasts.

This is by far not the only way to grow your follower count. Here are some other ways:

- Live tweet during the stream (learn from Dr. Disrespect and the h1 devs)
- Conduct giveaways on Twitter
- Do a Q&amp;A

Once you’ve racked up a few followers, there are also a number of things you can do to get new and old viewers back into your future streams:

## Post a “Going Live” tweet whenever you’re about to start your broadcast.

I recommend you make use of funny or interesting gifs and videos in your “going live” tweets. These days, a simple image rarely is enough to catch someone’s attention while scrolling by on Twitter.

Also, If you give the user a bit of entertainment before leading them to your stream, it can help big time for leading them to watch your broadcast. (you can embed your streams into twitter with a tool called kapsuli)

## Tag the developers of the game you’re playing.

Game companies love to see streamers enjoying their games, and by tagging them in your tweets, you have a much higher chance of them noticing your broadcast and deciding to help you out.

## Post valuable content.

Let’s face it: nobody wants to follow you on Twitter just to see your “going live” tweets.

# Form relationships with other streamers.

One of the best ways to grow your audience and get introduced to other like-minded streamers is to form relationships with other people in your community.

However, you need to be sure that you’re approaching the networking process with the right mindset.

It’s incredibly easy to detect when one streamer is only on another broadcast to leech off of the viewers of another streamer. When viewers notice this, you’re going to have a hard chance at gaining the respect of potential viewers.

Here are some ways you can form relationships with other streamers:

- Share content from the streamer on Twitter
- Hang out in their chatroom after your stream
- Host the other streamer (you may get it back in return)
- Use the collaboration section of this subreddit to find others looking to collab

Once you feel like you’ve begun to form a relationship with another streamer, don’t hesitate to reach out!
I don’t know of anyone that wouldn’t like to have some company while playing a game once and a while.

# Expand to other platforms.

You’ve probably noticed a ton of broadcasters now a days expanding their channels to YouTube. That’s because its an incredibly powerful tool for spreading your stream!

If you're not sure how to start posting videos, here's what we suggest:

At the end of your broadcast, download your VOD and find any funny or interesting moments in your stream. Then, make a short video of all of the interesting things that happened to you while playing.

Doing this will allow you to form a short video for YouTube that potential viewers can stumble across and get an idea of what your stream is about.

If they like the video, chances are they’ll decide to stop by your stream! Just be sure that you link your stream in the description of the video.

That's all for now! I hope you enjoyed this.

**If you like, we posted a full blog post about this on our medium blog, and we even added a few extra things you can do to get your name out!**

You can find that here: https://medium.com/powerspike/expanding-your-reach-as-a-streamer-the-right-way-3939ab52605f

Edit: Just remember, at the end of the day, no amount of promotion will grow a stream that isn't producing entertaining content. That's what's most important. If you're worried about your stream's growth, I highly recommend Bacon Donut's article, ""The Problm Might be You"". 

Edit Number 2: A great suggestion by domo_roboto of /r/Twitch! Using Twitch Clips is a great way to get streamers to catch funny moments during your stream and share them with their friends on social media.

62cc15,PSA: A real guide to protecting yourself on twitch!,"Hi guys,

I've never been the subject of a Doxx previously, but I have been the subject of various harassment plagues on facebook / twitter, but as I read someone else here posted you have to have a thick skin to be a streamer. If you think you might be fragile, don't even start with streaming. I knew someone who got multiple harrassing messages on facebook from people who made fake accounts and this friend ended up taking a long hiatus from streaming when there was no actual good reason to.

**Enough about pretenses, let's get on with the info you really need to protect yourself.**

**Upgrade your paypal account to business level so that people won't get your real life address with a donation to your channel.**

A user here posted this little guidebook on internet safety in conjunction with your information unwantedly listed in the public domain: https://www.safeshepherd.com/handbook

If you have your own website and you don't want your personal information revealed on it, you may want to go ahead and purchase ""whois.com anonymity"" to keep your personal info from getting out there. 

#YourPersonalInfo

Do not put any of the following together anywhere in your twitch profile unless you are absolutely **fearless:**

Your first name.

Your last name.

Your age

The name of your City and state/province/country.

A photo of yourself **that you also use on facebook / instagram.** What do I mean by this? Let's take a picture of a celebrity for example: [Brad Pitt](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjE2MTQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MDY0Nw@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg). I took that image from IMDB.com, now let's use an image search on google images to see how many domains host the same image? [Click here for that search.](http://bit.ly/2oB8kqQ) Now, unless you are as big as Brad Pitt himself, you're not going to have 10 pages of matching images on google, you might have 1 or 2, or in my case maybe 5 pages of matching images. The bottom line is, if you choose to post a photo of yourself on your twitch channel anywhere, simply do not use that same photo on your Instagram your Facebook or your twitter!

**There are third party websites that act as background-check websites, and they can only be used effectively if they have all three of the following infos: Your First name, Last name, and your state and/or city name.**

**Ancestry-esque websites:** I personally am not sure if these are paid services, but they list addresses and phone numbers of you and/or family that you have.

**Questions you might get on stream that you should not answer:**

""Where do you live and why is it so cold? I see you wearing a jacket.""

""It's so hot here right now, why are you wearing that turtle neck?""

""What's your real name?""

""I am new to America, today I just saw the Statue of Liberty. It was so beautiful! Does your city have any national landmarks or cool tourist hot spots too?!""

I've submitted this post and I will edit it for formatting purposes once it is posted, please stand by.

Feel free to submit your own innocuous questions below that might sound like Doxx-Bait or give me some more information that can help clarify this post.

628830,Doxed and Harassed by Total Strangers,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want these cyberstalkers finding my real Reddit account.  

As of recently, I got doxed and harassed by complete strangers for no good reason.  

It started off when my friend who's also a streamer got randomly doxed while streaming IRL.  She wasn't doing anything offensive nor was she showing off cleavage - it was literally just a chill stream with her sipping beer, talking to the chat, and listening to music.  Suddenly, these accounts with her full name in their usernames popped up in the chat and they started insulting her, calling her names, etc.  Then, they started spamming her phone number as well as calling her during the stream.  They made multiple accounts, all of which were reported, and I was a moderator helping her ban them from the chat.  I was also in her Discord during the stream voice chatting with her.  

Needless to say, I was their next target for being her mod and also being female.  They came into my stream about a week ago but couldn't find any information about me so it was mainly just insults.  When I first made my channel, a friend of mine helped me set up security measures so nothing would be connected to me personally - I had a separate email only for Twitch and everything and never used my real name.  

But someway, somehow, they found me.  And since Sunday, I had been receiving calls from them.  They spent a week digging up information about me in order to find my real name, my phone number, and even my current address.  I suspect that they had somehow gotten into my Amazon account because during one of the calls, one of them mentioned how I had an Amazon Prime Student account - which is impossible to know unless the account has been accessed.  

Apparently, they say they're not the type to go after financial information or do swatting because it would be illegal enough for law enforcement to come after them.  But, the harassment is relentless.  I haven't streamed much at all, because I've been sick and also busy with school.  Yet, that doesn't stop them from spamming my phone with calls wanting me to stream, plus them spamming my chat occasionally with requests to stream or them harassing the streamers I host.  It's ridiculous.  They did the same thing to my friend, but I feel it's gotten worse for my case.

It's basically two guys, but one of them seems really obsessed with me.  It's turned from internet trolling/doxing to essential cyberstalking.  I can't always block their calls because they often spoof them to people I know.  I've only answered two of their calls because the first one was spoofed with my mother's number and the second one was spoofed with my close friend's number.  

They've even called my workplace to find out my schedule and when one of my coworkers accidentally informed them about when I was going to work my next shift, they relayed that back to me.  Luckily, I was able to switch shifts so I didn't have to work during that specified time.  However, when that particular shift that they knew about started, they called my work repeatedly.  It was mainly that one obsessed guy talking and he kept asking for me.  When told I wasn't there, he got aggressive and insisted I was saying things like, ""I KNOW she's there.  Where is she?  She's SUPPOSED to be there.  Why isn't she there?""  He called at least seven times and harassed my coworkers and my manager.  Luckily, I'm blessed to work with such awesome people because they had my back and eventually just started trolling him.  They suspected he was trying to get me fired by harassing my workplace.  

I've already started to file a police report and I've secured all accounts associated with me by changing the password and some of the email addresses while also setting up two-factor authentication.  I'm meeting with an investigator tomorrow to discuss options of how to approach this.  I'm honestly thinking about pressing charges because not only was the harassment excessive, but they've taken measures to bypass any effort to block them by spoofing numbers and they've even harassed my workplace.  They've invaded my privacy and dug in to my personal and social life without any authorization to do so.  In addition, the information they found was not public - they found a way to access it somehow.  

And apparently, they do this all for the ""lulz.""  They literally go through so much effort just to get a rise out of people.  When I spoke to them on the phone, I remained relaxed and chill because there's no way I'm giving them that satisfaction.  And I'm not quitting Twitch either, but I'm laying low for a while to sort out stuff with my own life while also figuring out how to handle this situation.  It just makes no sense to me how two people can go through so much effort and trouble just to harass me - and they only want me to stream so they can spam my chat with my personal information or call me a ""bitch"" (which they already have plenty of times, and I'm not fazed, but apparently this is one of their biggest desires).  And to top it off, I did nothing to them.  I don't even know who they are.  They just randomly doxed my friend, I stood up for her, and then I became a target.  Yet somehow, that warrants this insane amount of harassment and cyberstalking that are normally reserved for people with a personal vendetta.  This is, as they claim, just a random occurrence of internet trolling.  They have no interest in money or hurting me - they just enjoy fucking with people.  It's batshit.  

I'm not quite sure what to do.  I've filed a police report and I'm going to add details to it when I speak to the investigator.  I've secured my accounts and my phone, though I plan to change my number if the calls continue to go on for so long.  I've also started shutting them out completely by not answering their calls, and on Twitch, I don't plan to acknowledge them at all whatsoever.  But I'm not sure if this is enough, plus they're also harassing and doxing other streamers.  If you ask me, I think these guys deserve jail time.  

So I guess my questions are:

1. What can I do to further secure my Twitch?  Is there any security flaws anyone can see that links my channel to my personal information somehow?

2. What do you recommend I should do about this situation?  Is there anyone else I should call or any other measures I need to take that I haven't considered yet?

Thank you for your time to read this and hope to hear back soon.

61sgur,Why does Twitch ignore the Casino section?,"So a problem that's been going on for a while now within the casino section on twitch is the constant bot accounts re-streaming other casino streamers content.

Lets take a look shall we - 
http://imgur.com/a/HiofR

As you can see in this picture above the casino section is having some issues with people using others content and viewbotting. There's alot more people doing the same thing but I just grabbed a few to show an example of how it is.

Multiple people are reporting these channels daily and yet they are able to keep streaming. This is extremly disrespectful towards the original streamers to daily see people stealing their content and get away with it.

You might wonder why people are restreaming content? 

Its pretty simple they want people to use their affiliate links instead of the original streamers. So at the bottom of the streams they place their own affiliate links to different casinos. 

Nothing wrong with having affiliate links but using OTHER peoples content to promote them should be instantly banned.

If this was happening to any of the big name streamers out there they would be banned within the hour but these people has been able to get away with it for weeks. 

Please sort this out and help us shed some light on the situation

61als9,Important information for German live-streamers: A troubling decision by the ZAK due to an outdated and somewhat imprecise definition might group online live-streaming and television into the same category - requiring streamers to obtain an expensive license and follow other television guidelines,"I tried to convey as much information in the title as possible with 300 characters, but here a bit more information:

Due to our somewhat outdated laws and guidelines concerning anything technology related, the Landesmedienanstalt has temporarily ruled that live-streaming requires a Rundfunklizenz (broadcasting license), which costs between 1000€ and 10000€, depending on audience size and other factors.

If this wasn't troubling enough, there are other implications: If live-streaming has to abide by the same guidelines and regulations as television does in Germany, then you will no longer be allowed to stream violent and other Jugendgefährdende material (material harmful to young persons) before 10pm. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you would furthermore have to aquire the services of a Jugendschutzbeauftragten (youth protection commissioner?) who ensures that you do follow all the regulations that are in place.

**If you didn't follow these rules and continued to broadcast without license, you'd effectively be a pirate station, which is a criminal offense.** 

I however wasn't able to find out what the actual punishment would be, pirate stations are so uncommon that even in the TV and radio field there are next to no rulings, let alone about things on the internet. 

The Landesmedienanstalt has also stated that the guidelines are in need of an update, as cases like this weren't considered when they were originally written, meaning that this ruling might be changed in the future.

Basically, they *have* to rule this way at the moment, because they can't afford to set a precedent which would allow TV and radio stations to later ditch paying for their own Rundfunklizenz while pointing at this ruling.

**However, until that happens, this ruling is absolutely legal, as they are following the current word of the law.**

615iab,"Streamers: Your ""Regular(s)"" should not be exempt from being basic, decent human beings. Stop allowing it.","There's a very troublesome and consistent problem among Twitch streaming communities. And this post is basically a **plea to the streamers** to do something about what they indeed have control over.

The problem I'm referring to has to do with ""regulars"" of a stream. Countless times I will join a new stream in hopes to find friendly communities, but almost every time there is that (at least one) user that says the most ignorant things, reacts in the most immature manner, and/or is flat out rude - and the majority of the time the user is what the stream and their community considers a ""regular"".

I've dealt with this many times, but the final straw was just earlier this week when a ""regular"" gave me a completely unwarranted and unexpected reply consisting of ""kys"" (acronym for kill yourself). When I asked was that directed at me, the user said it was. When I asked why and for what purpose, they said they didn't know and continued to accent their comments with ""lol's"" or ""rofl's"". And again I wish I could say this was the first time experiencing something like this, **but it's an unfortunate pattern that drives me away from what otherwise I think would be a great community**.

I would also suggest that if you're in my situation and a regular has discouraged you from staying with the community, **to let the streamer know this**. No drama is necessary, no hateful messages are needed. A simple message stating that you don't appreciate being treated the way you are by X user is why you're not sticking around. Or you could even send them a message off-stream via some other social network.

Streamers: **Find some courage. Have the strength to call out a regular on their BS**. It doesn't matter if they were follower number one - nothing should give a person the privilege that allows them to be negative and hurtful to other new users in the chat. Will it be a little awkward? Possibly. But in the end, such as in my case, you're losing future viewers because you don't have the guts to call out a regular acting like a jerk, **even though that ""fake laugh"" you give and awkward body language you show clearly indicates you're not comfortable with how the user is acting either**. Do something. Say something. Let them know that whether you're follower number one or follower number one thousand, **everyone in your community should be treated as equal in the sense of respect and tolerance**.

TL;DR: Streamers, grow a spine and call out your regulars who act like assholes to everyone. It's not helping you or helping you grow your community, and also causing you to miss out on other potential followers who would like to contribute some sort of positivity and communication in your stream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/615iab/streamers_your_regulars_should_not_be_exempt_from/,1490311893.0,219,0.82,124,Twitch,ankle_shaman
612tfw,"Elgato Gaming announces Stream Deck, a customizable Stream Controller. Have a question? We have answers.","Hello to all at r/Twitch.

My name is Jeff Stegner, I’m the Product Marketing Manager for Elgato Gaming.

If you haven’t heard the news, we just announced a new product for our gaming line, simply named Stream Deck. Stream Deck is a streaming controller that allows you to control different aspects of your stream at the touch of a button. It uses 15 programmable LCD keys that can be completely customized, letting you label your different controls effortlessly. And with Stream Deck supporting folders, this little guy can store up to 210 actions. 

http://e.lga.to/streamdeck

A clutch feature of Stream Deck is for PC gamers. When you’re in a PC game, it’s like you’re locked in — in order to control your stream at all, you have to Alt-Tab out of your game to access any controls with mouse and keyboard. Lame. With Stream Deck, easily change scenes and cue up graphics or video clips without ever taking yourself out of the action.

This product meant for streamers, so we wanted to take a moment to fill you guys in on it, as well as answer questions you may have. So myself and Phil (u/Ltroyalshrimp), our Technical Marketing Manager will be answering your questions today since this is the first time a product like this has been released.

Before submitting your questions, let me answer a few right off the bat. 

Q: Does this only work if I use an Elgato capture card?
A: NOPE. You do NOT need to use an Elgato capture card to be able to take advantage of Stream Deck (though come on, you know you want one). Out of the box, Stream Deck has integration with OBS Studio and Game Capture software, so if you just do screen recording on OBS, you can use this to control your stream.

Q: So this works with OBS Studio?
A: Of course. We recognize how popular OBS Studio for PC gamers, and this product is so helpful for PC streamers, we knew support was a must have. 

Q: You have support for Twitch, Twitter, OBS Studio, and Game Capture. What about my favorite app XXX? 
A: Stream Deck supports hotkeys so if there is a software or platform that we haven’t directly integrated with yet, you can simply use global hotkeys in order to control that software with Stream Deck. We will continue to add more and more features and integrations with Stream Deck, but you can get your use right away with the hotkey feature.

Q: Does this work on Mac?
A: Yes! Stream Deck is completely cross platform on Windows and Mac. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/612tfw/elgato_gaming_announces_stream_deck_a/,1490285627.0,72,0.93,119,Twitch,SteggyB

60gbch,Don't underestimate viewers with low connection speed,"I always had a connection speed that doesn't go beyond 3mbps even though I paid for 20. I don't live in a farm, I live in Paris.

This is the case for a lot of people. People are trying to do the math and reassure themselves that they can stream at an insane bitrate. They definitely can, but they're losing a sizeable chunk of viewership.

You can make the case that Twitch is a congregation of people with above average connection. I don't think this is true. Twitch is more than that, it hosts a lot of events that a lot of people wants to see regardless of the connection they have. People watches from everywhere, and make sure you don't gate the access is a key component of streaming, much more than the tech-savvy guy with disposable income and a 4K set complaining your 720p stream isn't up to his standards (doesn't happen). 

I'm a partnered streamer myself, I stream at 500-600kbps (with a lot of tweaks), I cannot watch most streams out there. More power to them if they want the stream to look nice but keep in mind : 

**1)** There is a lot of people who cannot watch your content if you stream above the 2000 range regardless of how you think otherwise. 

**2)** Even if you are a partner, this doesn't mean you can go all ham. Viewers doesn't contend with watching in low quality. Again, most of you knows more than the average viewer. Most of them doesn't understand the bitrate isn't the same for every streamer. If they buffer at the source settings, they won't think the problem is them and they're just going to move out.

Look beyond your window. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/60eazi/new_twitch_bitrate_guidelines_i_dont_have/) details the average connection speed in countries. This is not how internet works. People have families who uses the same connection, they watch TV, they use Wi-Fi weakening the signal, they do other things on their computer WHILE watching a stream.

At the end of the day, you just have to decide who your target audience is. If you want to cater to everyone, you have to understand the requirements and not downplay the state of internet over the world, France is a developed country but its internet access is a shitshow. You need to inform yourself.

But if your target audience caters to those who has the means to afford a good connection to watch your 6000kbps stream (and arguably the ones who are more likely to invest in your stream) then go for it.

I don't know if Twitch ever has plans to do anything more with it. One annoying thing about the system is that it pretty much recommends anyone that whispers you, or that you whisper, as a friend. Even if its a spam account, some annoying troll, or someone who is straight up harassing you. If you block the person, it still recommends them as a friend... why?

5zjd86,"What makes you confident you're going to ""make it"" on Twitch?","Were you the kid that everyone loved in school? Have you excelled elsewhere that makes you sure of your broadcasting abilities? There's a lot people who sincerely believe they're going to be able to quit there job to stream one day, so I'm curious as to makes people confident.

I visit friends who live in Hollywood every year, and one of the biggest ""eye-roll moments"" I have out there is trying to wade through the sea of delusion when meeting new people. Everyone thinks they're that diamond in the rough that is going to be the next Brad Pitt or Jennifer Anniston, and it gets exhausting meeting that same person over and over again.

I get a bit of that same feeling when checking out other Twitch streams. It seems like 9 out of 10 streamers have something along the lines of ""I'm just trying to live my dream of being a full-time Twitch streamer!"" in their bio -- and then couple that with stories on this subreddit about people who are quitting their jobs to pursue this as a career? It makes me nervous for those people. 

Based on the fact that there are roughly 20k partnered streamers at the moment and there are 2 million individual people who streamed in February, that means the average streamer has a 1% chance of getting partnered (I’m aware that this is oversimplified). And how many of those even make enough to make it a full time job? I don’t know that number, but I bet its lower than you think.

I’m sorry if this comes off as pessimistic. Maybe I'm just grumpy because I'm at my desk job. But tell me… what makes you so sure?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5zjd86/what_makes_you_confident_youre_going_to_make_it/,1489584903.0,110,0.89,184,Twitch,Cannondale1986

I'm streaming using OBS which I have installed on my mac. The issue here is that I am not experienced with streaming at all. 

I would love to use multiple cameras, but it looks like I'll need a video card of some sort in order to do that. I tried plugging in my gopro to the computer, but I couldn't find it as a video capture device. I'm not willing to pay the $200 or whatever it is to get a video card for 2-3 additional cameras to the Facetime HD Camera that is already on my macbook... 

My creative mind got to work and I decided I would use my phone camera to stream. I still need a video card for that, but I can use airserver to mirror my phone's camera app to the computer, and then from there I can set up a window capture. The only issue now is that aside from additional buffer, there is the unnnecessary/unwanted content on the screen,. There's the flash, the timer, switch camera, slider between settings, record button, annd photos, but I just want the camera. 

I have an iPhone 6s, 7, and a google pixel that I would like to set up as cameras. Does anyone have any other ideas?

Additionally, if I were to accept donations during the stream, how would you recommend doing that? I'm looking into stream labs right now.

5yg80e,Streaming full time and I have a completely new outlook on Twitch and Succeeding,"I tried streaming a little over a year ago while working full time and after a couple months I had to give it up (I'm in my early 30s, Married, etc) and just didn't have time. Long story short, I have had the opportunity to stream full time and try to live out a dream in November and since doing so have a completely new outlook on the streaming world.

I am currently streaming 6-7 days a week, and on average 6 hours a day (as long as Comcast lets me! GRR). Going into it and from my experience before, I knew a set schedule/consistency would be huge, and it has helped me a ton, but after the first couple months I wasn't growing as fast as I had hoped (even though I am doing this for the love, I am also losing money doing so since I am living off my savings to try and make this work, luckily my wife is very supportive). That's when I started networking and supporting others as much as I could (finding communities on twitter, finding other users around my community size to host on Twitch, eventually started working on Youtube, joining game communities on Reddit, etc). I am still trying to find new ways to get my name out there, but I cannot stress enough how helpful networking is. With that said, I stream earlier than a lot of North American streamers with my situation (my standard time is 12pm-6pm pst, so sadly most people I host can't return the favor, but it still helps!). 

On top of all of that, you also need to a) continue to find new ways to improve yourself as a broadcaster &amp; your stream (I try and watch past broadcasts of others and myself daily to see what I can do better) b) Continue to add/change things with your stream to keeps things fresh c) you have to genuinely have fun! A lot of people say this but you don't FULLY get it until you go full time. If you stream part time you can fake it or do what you think the stream wants, but once you go full time, it is a whole different game. If you are lying to yourself, the chat will eventually see through you - so my biggest advice: be you from the start. d) The amount of work, effort, etc is huge. I had no idea how draining it would be mentally some days - in doing so, I look at streamers that have done this for years in a completely different way. Prior to doing this I never once subbed/donated, and that has changed. I don't have much money to throw around with my financial situation (stated above) but I have subbed to a few streamers and donated as well, which I honestly thought I'd never do. It may not be a lot of money, but once you realize the effort that goes into it, it is the least I could do to someone that provides hours or entertainment for others.

I have been investing a lot of time into all of this. Hopefully it works out, but if it doesn't, I can without a doubt say I tried my heart out. If any of you have any questions for me, please let me know - I would love to try and help.

5xupr7,Explaining Twitch to those who don't understand it.,"I get asked all the time by relatives, and just older people in general who don't know what Twitch is and how it works. They seem to think it's all about the money, and that if you aren't making money, then it's a waste of time. They don't understand the reasons why the ""idiots sit there and watch others play video games."" When someone asks me why someone donates to me, I can't think of an explanation other than they want to support me, and even after that they ask why. To them it looks as if someone is throwing money away, which I don't believe it is. They are baffled that someone doesn't get anything in return for donations, and they are baffled that someone wants to sit there and watch me play video games. They don't understand the audience interaction, the communities that are formed because of Twitch, how broadcasters and viewers help each other, how you can meet people and make new friends through Twitch, the list goes on.

It's extremely difficult to explain this to someone who is another generation or two older than you. If you have seen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMZ2QFLrLvk (The Media Learning of eSports), you'll see that most of them are older people acting like assholes towards the entire idea of eSports/gaming, but that's another post entirely.

5xphs5,"Our 3 person stream setup, some issues we had and how we resolved them.","## Intro
I see quite a few posts here about how to stream multiple people. Here is our solution.

First off some pics of our stream setup **[http://imgur.com/a/jb649](http://imgur.com/a/jb649)**  It's not as clean as it should be, but it's getting there.

Any questions feel free to ask or PM and i can try to answer them to the  best of my knowledge. 

###Green Screen
This was fun, and worked out quite well, we need a bit more overhead lighting to kill shadows.

* We painted an entire wall green, lit the top an bottom of the screen with LEDs to conserve space and provide semi-even lighting.
* We wrapped cloth around the chairs and strung it together with bungee cord to hide them.

###Capture devices
We have a ton of room for improvement here, but we are trying to limit in the spending category.

* 2 USB Avermedia extremecap U3s and one PCI-e Avermedia HD pro

* 3x Logitech C922 (we had c920s before this but they required extra software to be able to control settings independently moving to the 922 solved that issue.) 

###Audio
Audio was probably the hardest problem to solve since we all had setups we wanted to keep, as well and independent control of as many sources as possible.

We all used Voicemeeter in some capacity to split audio and control sources. This allow all 3 of us to control our discord, music, and game volumes separate.

Another upside to this setup is that we can turn music off to us while still keeping it on for the stream, as well as mute users in discord to the stream while still hearing them ourselves.


* 2x Shure sm7b and 1 Sennheiser e935

* Alacon - sm7b into Tc helicon voicelive play, then out to a mackie mixer that sits plugged into the stream pc. Astro A50 headset

* Pixel - sm7b running into a mackie mixer, then into audition, and output to the stream pc. Using AKG k7xx headphones through a Bravo audio V2 headphone amp.

* Scoodah - Sennheiser e395 into a shure Xu-2 and voicemeeter VBAN to the stream PC.


###Streaming 

* We used OBS websocket to create a touch screen friendly environment to be able to switch OBS scenes from our desks.

* Scene transitions are all done with CSS and after effects. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5xphs5/our_3_person_stream_setup_some_issues_we_had_and/,1488752516.0,126,0.95,57,Twitch,0xpProject

5xig70,[Guide] Twitch Partnership Crash Course,"Recently I've noticed some threads here (and also questions from my friends) about what happens/what to do after you get your sub button/partnership. I feel like people always have great coverage on what happens before (applying, getting your numbers up, that sort of stuff) partnership, but not afterwards. [This video covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T1VGK5z0ww) what you should expect after getting partnered/your sub button, sort of like a checklist of what to setup w/ your stream.

I hope the Twitch police doesn't come and shoot me down for this, but I'm pretty sure a lot of this is common knowledge and I really just wanna help the new partners out there because I know getting partnered can be equally amounts super hype &amp; stressful. Sometimes it feels like you're thrown into it and having guidance from someone who has been through it before can make it all a little easier. Hope this helps!

5x4jx4,Please know what Gating is and how to use it,"Heey r/Twitch,

In my opinion there is nothing worse than coming in somebodies stream to only hearing keyboard and mouse sounds when the broadcaster isn't talking.

You can get rid of these noises by using a gate in OBS, but usually the standard gate is not really cutting it. The ReaGate is pretty nice as it has a build in side chain, which makes things a whole lot easier. Don't know what sidechaining or gating is? No problem, I got you covered with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfBBhc5xnUE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be) new guide.

Please people, take the time to learn how to gate and make audiophiles like me happy with a well gated stream :)

Have fun streaming!Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys, I didn't realize there are people actually enjoying the sound of keyboards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5x4jx4/please_know_what_gating_is_and_how_to_use_it/,1488475544.0,161,0.86,55,Twitch,MrScatterBrained

5wyvwl,Why I will no longer be using Ankhbot,"**EDIT5: It seems that Ankhbot staff have addressed this concern I mentioned yesterday they will be updating their EULA and their editor roles in the most recent update. Although all this could have been avoided, I have respect for these dudes for correcting and addressing out concerns. The new EULA and changes to the bot address all the concerns I had for it. Thank you guys.** http://marcinswierzowski.com/Gallery/Projects/AnkhBotR2/Blog/ 

There has been some negative feedback regarding Ankhbot’s “Greetings” when their staff come into chats with streamers using their bot. Tbh, this is a NON-ISSUE and Ankh is getting too much flak for something so little. The real issue that came into view because of this publicity is much more concerning.

Here is a screenshot of the EULA in Ankhbot.

http://i.imgur.com/ZrLyQwr.png

If a staff member is to act inappropriately or I don’t deem his greeting to meet my channels rules (I will say that they do meet the channels rules so no harm there) then if I ban them, then I can no longer use the bot.  

*Okay so if that is the case, how does Ankh stop a user from using the bot from doing so?*

They do so due to creating a phone home. Ankhbot connects to their server, receives validation (or however you want to describe it) and will only connect to Twitch chat if you are not on that banlist. This was discovered by blocking all ip’s except Twitch. Ankhheart has since confirmed that they have a banlist and Momo has also confirmed this information. See tweet here https://twitter.com/AnkhHeart/status/836997659512745985 for confirmation on the ban list and phone home.


Personally, I am against this type of behavior regardless of whether it is allowed or not and that is only an opinion and nothing of real substance.  However, per the Twitch Dev agreement it is required that if information is obtained from the user, then an opt out option must be provided at all times. http://i.imgur.com/aENjZtw.png

https://www.twitch.tv/p/developer-agreement

**If I am wrong about any of this please point out that I am wrong because if I am I will take full responsibility for this misunderstanding.**

This is the part that is more concerning. I hope that Ankh provides an opt out option. I understand that the product is free. I supported the program since I started streaming over 18 months ago but I will no longer be supporting it due to the above. 

I will also say that Ankh did request things like this to be emailed to him. Honestly though, I find it hard to have a group discussion and feel that if he would like to address this issue then he can reply here rather than sending individual emails. I also believe in transparency and feel reddit is a good place to have this discussion.

EDIT1: I also want to add that this is something we should be questioning about regarding ALL Bots and not just Ankhs. I don't have time investigate other bots unfortunately. If there are others doing this then it will be nice to know which are doing so. 

EDIT2: I was also missing the screenshot of the Dev agreement that states the data must be disclosed on what is being obtained. Maybe this doesn't apply to Ankh? but it states it in the section in regards to use with Twitch API.

EDIT3: I am placing a screencap from Momo confirming they are tracking who is using the bot. http://i.imgur.com/RWlZRwr.png This is tracking data. Interpret it in your own way. I guess its possible that this could be seen as not ""tracking data"" but if so I would like to know how this is not tracking data.

5wk5hl,OBS Studio 18.0 has been released!,"&gt;https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/releases/tag/18.0.0

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; #Changelog:
&gt; 
&gt; **General Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Added audio monitoring on Windows/OSX. Audio monitoring allows the ability to listen to the audio of a source, and can be enabled via the advanced audio properties. You can set it to monitor without outputting, or monitor and output. The device used for monitoring can be changed in advanced settings
&gt; * Added an audio compressor filter
&gt; * Added a ""Color"" source which displays a solid color
&gt; * Added a VST audio filter for Windows/OSX. Allows applying VST plugins (only up to version 2) to filter audio
&gt; * Added a network connection stability indicator similar to classic, displays green for no congestion, yellow for increasing congestion, to red for beginning to drop frames
&gt; * Added separate timers to the status bar for streaming and recording
&gt; * Added options to general settings: Always minimize to tray, save/restore projectors on startup/shutdown, and options to automatically start replay buffer
&gt; * Added command line options: --startreplaybuffer, --minimize-to-tray
&gt; * Added an option for ultrawide -&gt; wide scaling distortion to the scaling filter
&gt; * Added an ""Apply LUT"" video filter, which allows applying a lookup table to modify a source's colors
&gt; * Added a warning message if starting stream/recording fails
&gt; * Added configurable GOP size to FFmpeg output
&gt; * Added a checkbox to custom FFmpeg output that allows using any codec with a container format (due to the fact that it can display fewer codecs than are typically compatible with certain containers, though note that it may fail if an incompatible codec is chosen)
&gt; * Fixed a bug where mixing visible/invisible sources would sometimes cause the audio of the visible sources to stop outputting
&gt; * Fixed a performance issue with audio meters that could cause audio latency to increase unintentionally, or cause issues with some devices
&gt; * Fixed issues resizing a source when the source is flipped horizontally/vertically
&gt; * Fixed a few potential crashes/freezes
&gt; * Fixed a potential crash with the browser source and updated to chromium 57
&gt; * Improved accessibility text on the main window
&gt; * Cleaned up the general pane of the settings dialog a bit
&gt; 
&gt; **Windows-specific Changes**
&gt; 
&gt; * Added an option to advanced settings to enable new experimental network code
&gt; * Added a ""low latency mode"" option to advanced settings which minimizes network impact caused to other programs on the computer (same as ""Minimize network impact"" in classic). The new network code must be enabled to use
&gt; * Added an auto-updater for Windows
&gt; * Fixed an issue where Windows wouldn't show up in window lists (i.e. game capture or window capture) if using kaspersky
&gt; * Fixed an issue drawing certain chinese characters on the GDI+ text source
&gt; * Fixed an issue capturing theHunter: COTW
&gt; * Fixed a crash with the AMD AMF encoder

5wb8mr,New/Small Streamers: Your Channel Design can be Hurting You,"Well, I've been browsing the Twitch reddit for a few months now and what I've seen time and time again are new or small streamers asking for advice when it comes to designing their humble channel. Because they see successful, established streamers with professional looking overlays, lots of visuals, and ""pizzazz"" (*do kids these days know what pizzazz is? jeez, I'm really showing my age now*). Well, here are two things to keep in mind when you are designing the look of your channel and stream.    
    
**Don't look greedy.**    
When you ask for donations as a new channel, it sorta makes it look like you are out for money, even when that's not your intention. When I see a bot timer asking for a donation, a donator list in your panels, a $500 donation goal overlay, and a recent donator overlay....and you have 9 followers...come on man. And what is even more baffling is when I do want to donate to show support, a new streamer sets their minimum donation amount to $5... Bro..    
    
**Keep things simple...for now**    
I find that new streamers think more is better visually: recent follow, what song is playing, chat timers going off every 15 minutes, etc.. But when it comes down to new streamers trying to get their foot in the door and start growing, visuals aren't going to get you there. When someone, like myself, looks for new streamers to watch, we care about the streamer themselves. We want to see a new personality, a new insight, a new experience. Who cares about fancy overlays or the best looking panels? I'm not saying having overlays and other graphics will hurt you, in fact, poorly designed ones may show you're amateurish. I'm just saying, don't put so much worry into your visuals, focus on yourself as a streamer.

5vuiun,My royalty-free music for your streams now has a website!,"Hello everyone!

First things first, here is a link to my new website where you can download my royalty-free music: http://avarenmusic.co/ **EDIT**: I'm dumb...I forgot to put the ""music"" part at the end. This is the correct link!

Now on to a bit of an introduction.

I have posted in multiple places on Reddit offering my royalty-free music, and it has gotten a positive response. I make royalty-free Electronic music under the name ""Avaren."" All of my songs are licensed under the ""Creative Commons - Attribution"" license, which gives anyone the ability to use my songs, for free, however they would like, in whatever project they wish, so long as I am credited somewhere (this can be as simple as a ""Music by: Avaren"" at the end, or in the description. It is a very easy rule to follow).

I recently made a website where you can download my music! This came about when some people requested I upload my music to a place like Pond5. I found that their licenses were a bit too strict for my liking, or they required payment of some kind, which is something I never intended for my music. It is a passion project, and I absolutely love how many people have been able to use my songs in their projects because of the license.

I want to thank anyone who was in one of the first threads I made offering my music for giving me the confidence to begin posting my stuff online to give away to other people. I have been amazed by the response, and am so happy people have found my music to be fitting of their projects. The Discovery Channel's ""HowStuffWorks"" has used some of my music, and I have seen my songs in videos, games, and documentaries from all over the world. This is honestly a dream come true, seeing my music in so many places, and knowing that there are people out there enjoying it. I am constantly working to improve my artistry, and can't wait for my next royalty-free release.

If you'd like to check out [my Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/avaren/), it is the most up-to-date repository of my songs, and all of my royalty-free music is available as a free download there as well.

Thanks for reading! If any of you decide to use my songs for anything, I'd love a message here, on my Soundcloud, or on my Facebook page. It's always exciting for me to see someone new using my music in a project! Whether it's a YouTube video, an indie game, or a Twitch stream, please share with me, and I will reply to thank you and make a post featuring the link(s) you send me!

~Avaren

5vpunb,3 Months Of Streaming - What Have I learned?,"Hey Everyone,

I just wanted to make a quick informative ""guide"" if you will of the things I have learned in the first 3 months of streaming, this may not be useful to those of you that have already established a name for yourselves but those smaller guys or people looking to start out, take some time to read.

One of the first things I learned when streaming was that it hurts to look at your viewer count, or even have it visible at any one time. By this, I mean; When you have chat up, don't show the viewer list, don't show the viewer count and here's my reasoning. I don't look at my viewer count because;

* You **don't change your attitude** depending on number of people watching.
* You **don't demoralise yourself** if you don't realise you've dropped a viewer or two.

An example of when I have used this little tip was when I was streaming Metro Last Light, and I did not realise I had 50 or so viewers at the time. Meaning I was continuing on like I only had my regulars, which makes you not only a more genuine streamer but really helps keep your morale up.


The second thing I learned and possibly the most important thing I have learned while streaming is that it takes **a long time** to build a viewer base. Streaming is **not easy**, and you should definitely not underestimate the challenge you face when streaming. Here are a few things I would recommend doing &amp; not doing to help you grow;

**Do's:**

* **Collaborate with streamers a similar size to your channel** and learn from your own and their mistakes. You can really make great friends from streaming, so give everyone a chance! 

* **Set up a auto-host** function with your friends and fellow streamers that you enjoy watching or play with to help them out, and also help yourself out. If they notice you're doing this for them, they may return the favour.

* **Host after streams, do raids.** Show some love!

* Be 99% **you**. By this I mean there are things you cannot say on stream and opinions you cannot voice, but always be genuine, humble and most importantly, just be who you are, but slightly toned down.

* **Get some graphics made for you** before you begin to stream, no one will stay in a stream that has terrible graphics, unless there's something very unique about you that may make them want to stay! There are free sites online, it just takes a short google. But the best stuff you'll probably have to pay for, unless you're a designer yourself. 

* **Be Happy!** One of the hardest things about streaming is that you do have to be happy, or at least positive. If you're not enjoying it, don't do it.

* **Schedules are very important** and is for me at least, a must have. Even if you only stream 3 days a week, it's important that people know when and where to find you!

* **Use social media!** Twitter, Facebook etc. This is very important to help you grow, using twitter seems to be the most effective, use hastags and meet new streamers! One of the most common one's for users starting out streaming is #SupportSmallStreamers - Give it a go, it works!

* **Set up some alerts.** Streamlabs.com is one of the best ones. Find something you enjoy, or want to have as a follower alert, make it relate to you and something people will follow to hear again!
* Set up a bot to help moderate your channel, the one I use is Ankhbot. But there are others such as MooBot and NightBot. Tutorials are online which can be found pretty easily!






**Don'ts:**

* **Don't let trolls get to you.** Everyone gets trolls, if you laugh at them or pay no attention they will get bored and leave.

* **Don't be rude to your viewers**, no one wants a rude broadcaster. These people are taking their time out of their day to watch **you**, remember that. Don't take them for granted, remember they are here to watch you, the streamer is more important than the game 99% of the time.

* **Don't beg for donations/follows/hosts.** This gets you no where. A more friendly way to do this would be to say something along the lines of ""If you're enjoying what you see, consider dropping a follow"".



I will do my best to reply to all the comments below. Just remember guys, you're part of a huge community that shows a lot of love to each-other. Give it time, put in the effort and you'll do great.

I understand that 3 months may not be a long time, but it was enough time to learn a lot. I really hope you fall in love with streaming like I did and meet a lot of great people through it.

I wish you all the best of luck!

5vnp8l,PSA: Streamers who accept donations/tips via PayPal. Please take a second to verify your security.,"**TL;DR**

Change your PayPal account to a Business account to conceal your first and last name.

---

**The Issue**

There is currently a very widespread issue among streamers of all sizes, however I personally notice it mostly on streamers who are just starting out or may have a relatively low follower count. These could be streamers who just don't take streaming seriously, or they could simply be new and not understand the toxicity and malicious users that exist within the Twitch community, and could never fathom someone taking this information and doing the horrible things we hear happen on a regular basis.

What I am referring to specifically are users who have donations/tips set up in their profile that either link the donating user to the Streamlabs donation interface, or even sometimes directly to their PayPal ""pay me"" link, or essentially any third-party service that relies on PayPal for the payment to be made. **The problem is that an extremely large majority of streamers do not know how to conceal their full name upon donation. What is worse, is that you don't even need to make a donation to a user in order to make it to the PayPal confirmation page that reveals their full name**. Also in the PayPal receipt after the donation is made, it shows the user's email address as well. So if you have your PayPal name set up as your streamer name, make sure you're not using a personal email address that has something like ""firstname.lastname@email.com"" either.

---

**How It's Done**

This is a streamer who has a link to Streamlabs (edit for clarity: this is not an ""issue"" directly related to Streamlabs, I only use them in this example). All I need to do is click on it and fill out a couple necessary fields with just filler text.

http://i.imgur.com/d7kXjHK.png

Once I've done that, I just hit ""Donate"" which then takes me to the PayPal payment confirmation page. This is where the personal information is revealed.

http://i.imgur.com/U9m8n7n.jpg

As you can see, the Twitch Username as well as the full first and last name (and sometimes middle depending on how the user has their PayPal information set up) is completely visible to me before I even log in to make a donation. What this means is that if someone wants to know your real name, it can be found with very little effort if you have not implemented the proper identity protection measures.

---

**Testing**

For experimentation purposes, I bounced through 20 Overwatch streams with users that had Donation links and had 500 or less followers. Of the 20 I checked, 17 of them had their real name visible. That is a scary ratio.

If you'd like to test on yourself, just go to your Twitch profile in your regular Firefox/Chrome browser. But instead of clicking on the link, right click the link and choose to either ""Open in Incognito Mode"" or... whatever Firefox's equivalent to that is. Follow the steps above and see if your full name shows up.

---

**Why Should I Care**

If you don't care, good for you. Please don't leave negative comments about users being ""too paranoid"" etc. If you're wondering why you should care, there's many reasons. First I'd advise you to just YouTube ""live swatting on Twitch"". Think this could never happen to you? You are completely underestimating the amount of trolls with nothing better to do than have fun tormenting people, whether you have 10 followers or 1000 followers. Secondly, your real name is a piece of vital information when it comes to ""database dumps"" that are becoming more and more common. Example, perhaps your real name is associated with a site that doesn't have too much detailed information about where you live, however it logs your IP. A user can then search these database dumps for your IP and find all your other usernames/sites that you've created and logged into and go from there. Perhaps another site where you used a completely unique username you thought was safe was associated with an IP address that was linked to your real name, and on that site you have information such as street address, credit cards, etc. Basically, if you can find a tiny bit of information about a person, you can chain off of that information via database dumps until you have an entire collection for doxing/swatting purposes.

**Anything Else?**

If there is a streamer(s) you love, please go check out their Donation links in their profile. If you see their full name listed, let them know. If they are fine with it, then it's completely cool - don't bug them about it. If they aren't okay with it, try and assist them with getting it changed. Be proactive and at least let all your favorite streamers know - that way they can decide for themselves if it's something they want to worry about or not.

5vervc,Ellohime here to share healthy tips for 24 hour streams (Should you still choose to do them),"THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG ASS POST SO... Let's go over some stuff right out of the gate.  

My handle on Twitch is Ellohime and I have been streaming nearly 4 years and done so successfully. I've done easily over **20+** 24 streams and last year in November was the last marathon stream I did, winning a Titanfall 2 contest for longevity streaming and going for a total of **36** hours (my longest stream to date).  
I am writing this due to the recent passing of a fellow streamer who pushed himself too far. In an attempt to educate and prevent accidents in the future, I am sharing what I know because I want the best for you all and also because I know more people are going to attempt it regardless.  
**I AM NOT A DOCTOR** nor am I any sort of medical professional. I'm merely a guy who built a stream on 24 hour broadcasts and have done a ton of research into the subject and execution of said broadcasts.  
I **DO NOT** encourage or endorse streaming long hours, I am simply doing this write up to share the information I have found and used successfully on my own journey. 
*****
IF you are **DEAD SET** on doing 24 hour streams the truth is they are **not healthy.**  
They are not something you should take lightly and you should do your own research AND consult a doctor about your physical health and your plans for streaming long-term.  
**I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, GO SEE A FUCKING DOCTOR FIRST.**  
If you care about yourself/your family/your audience GO. I did and I absolutely hate doctors so you can too.  
If he gives you the OK, here are some tips to better prepare yourself and keep it as healthy as possible:

1. **Get 6 - 8 hours of restful sleep before the big stream.** This is no brainer but must be mentioned. Sleeping more than this will leave you groggy and anything less than 4 hours just isn't sufficient for the pressure you're putting on your body (even if you can still do it). 

1. **DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL OR DO DRUGS before/during/after the stream.** Lets take a second to talk about this. This is especially important for the days leading up to your stream. You want to jump into this completely fresh both body and mind.  
Eat healthy foods, don't drink (or smoke if you can help it), and get some light exercise (walking) for several days prior. PITFALLS you may encounter or be tempted to try include drinking during stream (this is a HORRIBLE mistake both for longevity and health) or drinking so you can sleep better the night before (huge mistake). 

1. **Take frequent breaks.** Every 2 hours (3 if you push it) should incur a mandatory 5 - 10 min break.  
It doesn't matter if you are tired, it doesn't matter if you don't think you need it, *DO IT* (I'll talk more about what to do during this break below.)

1. **Plan your meals.** This should include AT LEAST (though i'd suggest more) 3 substantial/healthy meals (I prefer chicken breast/broccoli/salmon/brussel sprouts/oatmeal/eggs) with a focus on protein and complex carbohydrates.  
Snacking is in a lot of ways more important but *DO NOT* pick up chips or other high fat/salt junk food. We are looking for natural/healthy food with high ENERGY and the best way I've found to get it is in fruits.  
A plate of apple slices or a banana is godlike. Some other choices might be nuts (giggity), yogurt, sweet potatoes, honey or a small spinach salad.  
Honestly, you should almost constantly have something in arms reach and be snacking on this stuff even if you are not hungry but don't feel sick. This is your fuel, without it you are done. The reason it's so important to get this natural high energy food in you is because...

1. **NO ENERGY DRINKS/SODA.** This is the biggest mistake I see people make. We use natural foods for our energy so we don't need this poison. They will give you a great boost in energy but it's fleeting and will leave you in worse shape than it found you.  
With the fruits/nuts/whatever you have sustained energy over a long period not spikes of ups and downs which leave you bloated/irritable/exhausted.  
Drinks you should be going for are things like water with lemon, REAL fruit juice, REAL fruit smoothies, V8 veggie juice (find the one with low sodium), kombucha or coconut water and IF you need a pick me up coffee is not a terrible idea BUT should be used as your secret weapon last resort. Try to complete the 24 hours without it, but know it's there to make love to you when you need it. 

1. **Posture.** Make sure you are sitting up straight as often as you can remember to do so.  
Try not to slouch/lean forward/lean back too much.  
Eventually you will succumb to the temptation but fight it off as long as you can.

1. **This is a bit strange** but I've found some smells keep me awake also. Incense or even a wall plug-in can help for some people.  
Try peppermint or citrus scents.

1. **Take vitamins** up to and on the day of the stream. I find that Men's One A Day is great for us dudes, ladies I have no idea.  
Also, the Men's One A Day Silver is actually beastmode, yes it's for old guys but it's actually great for all men.

1. **Have someone at your place with you.** This could by any adult and the more time they have dedicated to you and what you are doing the better. Someone to bring you meals.. someone to check in on you.. someone to remind you to take a break.  
*This is super valuable.* I wouldn't even attempt a 24 hour stream if you don't have someone there helping you. 

1. **Create goals for the stream.** This is the best way to keep yourself from getting bored. Boredom is the number 1 killer of 24 hour streams.  
Bored 24 hour streamers tend to reach for the alcohol or energy drink to spice things up (or worse). As long as you have a specific goal in mind (and goals after that if you happen to achieve it early) it keeps you focused and gives meaning to what you are doing.  
Make it known to your audience what you are trying to achieve and get them excited about it as well. Be creative.

1. **During your break** you should be doing breathing exercises (explained below), using the bathroom, and moving around in general.  
I find going outside in the sun and pacing helps me best. The more sunlight you can get helps and pairing it with a bit of walking is great. Doesn't have to be long just keep moving.

1. **Play with the lights on**, not off. This helps reduce headaches and eye strain.

 &gt; *All of these tips are pretty basic, but this last tip is so basic you might never realize how important it is or even believe what I am saying.  
Some of you might find it wonky or pseudo-sciencey BUT it's been recognized by the scientific community at large, I've used it, it works wonders and is the foundation for all of these tips.*

1. **BREATHING.** I am not talking about normal breaths throughout the day, I am talking about making a conscious effort to oxygenate your blood through deep breathing techniques.  
The days leading up to the stream, the night before the stream, every break during the stream you should be focusing on your breathing.  
Here's what I do:  
    1. Find a nice quiet place to sit down and do 15 - 30 slow deep breaths expanding your stomach (NOT your chest, yes it matters) 
    1. then do 15 - 30 more but this time when you let out your air, keep some of it in. Do not exhale fully. Deep breath in, exhale 80 - 90%, repeat. 
    1. Try to lower the amount you exhale each time BUT NEVER HOLD YOUR BREATH (this will cause you to pass out silly face).  
If you start to feel a bit high thats natural. Identify the difference between feeling oxygen high and dizziness, you want that high but you don't want to be dizzy. If you do become dizzy **stop immediately**, you are likely doing something wrong. 
    1. Once you feel that high though, congrats, you've hyper oxygenated your blood which will make you feel great, keep you ALERT and FOCUSED. 

  I know, this sounds weird but just try it during your 24 hour streams and it makes it a cake walk, no bullshit.  
Again, I do it a few times a day leading up to the stream, the night before I go to sleep, when I wake up, and during every mandatory 5 - 10 min break each couple of hours.  
I also try to visualize my stream and what I am trying to accomplish during this mediation. You'll be so different your chat will swear you took drugs when you went off camera.  
Here's some extra links that I find interesting regarding breathing and its applications from VICE and TED Talks:  
&gt; * [Inside the Superhuman World of the Iceman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMjhwFE1Zw)
&gt; * [David Blaine: How I held my breath for 17 minutes](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_blaine_how_i_held_my_breath_for_17_min)

*****
I hope this helps someone out there. My heart breaks hearing about the recent passing of a fellow streamer but I know there are going to still be 24 hour streams and I want the best for you guys so I am sharing everything I know.  
If you have questions I can field some for awhile while I am doing other work and will try to check back here when I can.  
Remember, growing a channel can be fun and pushing yourself is great also, but be SAFE and smart. 

Take care guys and much love,

5ugman,The backlash of Communities on the Creative directory,"Hey guys,


I wanted to share some thoughts I had on Communities. Good and bad. I was just as excited as everybody else to see the Communities deployed on all directories, not just Creative and I think it encourage discoveries in the gaming directory. I myself had very interesting results after streaming in the gaming directory.


Although, communities have significantly changed the Creative directory. To give you an idea, Creative is now sorted by default by viewer count, no longer per community. You used to be able to list yourself in multiple communities, now you have to pick a single community. They also removed the community featured channel.


Overall, It seems like the Creative casters lost a lot of the exposure they used to have. You are lost in a sea of Creative broadcasters that do completely different things. From a viewer standpoint, I also feel like it got way harder to discover Creative casters as well.


And then I streamed. My viewer count was lower. Whatever, is it just a slow day? Then I saw that the video plays got significantly lower. 


First, I thought : Am I just whiny and delusional? Then I asked around, there IS a feeling that the Creative casters had less new viewers engagement and less growth since the implementation of communities. I am lucky enough to have a viewer base that makes sure that I don't end up at the rock bottom of the directory, but even then, I felt the difference.


It saddens me, as a lot of creative caster put a lot of heart and thought to their content, and they are straight NOT interested in gaming on Twitch. We lost something when communities was implemented. I feel a little bit let down, because I am primarily a Creative caster. I love it to bits and pieces, but I feel like casting it right now does more harm than good to my channel.


I don't have a miracle solution for this, but I do think the concept of communities needs to be refined as a whole. Maybe allow multiple communities for a single channel? Maybe change some things in the Creative directory? I'm just throwing ideas out there.


I don't want to start a war between Creative and Gaming, both of you ladies are pretty and unique little snowflakes. I just feel the change that affected Creative has been overall negative.

5tbs8n,I'm a 15-20 viewer streamer who raised $1008 for charity. Here are the things I did right and wrong.,"Hi! My name is McSwane and I was a twitch streamer! This charity stream happened over a year ago, and I stopped streaming August, 2016 to focus on other things, BUT I have had quite the itch to write this... guide?... out. Mainly, I hope to show the other small guys that it IS possible to make a difference... even if you're itty bitty. I am sure there are many different opinions on how to effectively raise money, but these are just a few things I learned that I have been eager to share.

*The Right*

1) **Make it Personal**

* I am convinced (as much as that's worth) that this is the MOST important thing you can do. I see many streamers who raise money just to raise money for the current meta-charity, **Which is not a bad thing,** but EVERYTHING YOU DO will be of higher quality if your cause is personal to your life. Raising money for kids with cancer is AWESOME, and should be commended, but if you have a younger sibling with cancer, your drive gains 100+ levels. 

* People are quick to point and yell ""PHONY!"", question your enthusiasm, and challenge your motives. A personal cause will make your passion not only be more authentic, but more contagious to your viewers. This authenticity will increase your thankfulness for donations, joy for hosts, and give you a higher sense of accomplishment.

* Cast the vision. A personal cause allows you to give them REAL LIFE situations, which makes the cause real to your viewers. 


2) **Prepare ahead of time.**.

* Unfortunately, many broadcasters raise for the wrong reasons, and people have become cynical. Make your community aware of some of your hardships, that way they have no reason to think you are in it for the potential viewer boost. My brother committed suicide due to Schizophrenia and my peeps knew about it looong before I ever started planning to raise money for mental illness. 

* Ahead of time is not a week. **The Behind-The-Scenes work is essential.** I started thinking/planning my charity stream 3 or so months in advance. This consisted of long tobacco pipe brainstorming sessions, hyping my community, letting my fellow stream bros know what I was doing, messaging the dev's of the games I would play, pestering my friends for help and communicating with NAMI (the charity I was supporting) about my intentions.

* If you made point 1 a priority, then this shouldn't be an issue. 

3) **Incentives matter**

* Many of my regulars gave just because they cared about me or the cause, but odds are the majority of your community will need a small push to click that donation button. Don't get mad, no one OWES you anything. So, give them a little somethin somethin for there hard earned cash.

* I created a Bowl of Dreams^TM where I would write the names of those who donated down and put it in the bowl. At random times, I would draw out a name and give that person some giveaway related to the game I was playing.

* I put up a wall light, taped ""Party"" on , and said if I raised $500 I would press it at midnight. The curiosity drove the community crazy, but also kept people around to see what happened when the button got pressed. I bet you want to know what happened eh? TOO BAD.                      Tee hee 

* Don't have money to spend on potential incentives? Message the dev's of the game's you'll play. Dev's can be high-class folks, and could hook you up with some goodies to giveaway. Don't be a dick and demand gifts, just let them know you plan on raising money by streaming their game. They may just pop in to watch, and that's ok.

Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea.

4) **Get your homies involved**

* I am blessed with great friends, and if you are a streamer, odds are you have a few buds... right?. *Get them involved* 

* Your friends may be your biggest donors. 

* My friends and I had a giant smash tournament. The community loved seeing our chemistry, and the side of me that only appears with loved ones. Remember, **your viewers care about you** and enjoy seeing you in your natural habitat with your bros. When you have a good time, the chat has a good time. When the chat has a good time, donations increase. When donations increase, the sick, hurt, and broken get help. Everyone wins.

5) **Charities want to know.**

* If you're like me, it can be hard to think large entities would even notice us babies with our sippy cups trying to raise pennies compared to 10,000+ viewer streamers. If you are like me, then raise your right hand 1 foot away from your cheek and move it left as fast as you can.

                                              The money you raise makes a difference.

* The gaming industry is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMING, and charities are always looking for new ways to raise money. The gaming world is a tough cookie to crack... egg to crack? Shell? Nut? W/e. The point is non-profits want in.

* I made NAMI aware of my charity stream, and they featured the event in their monthly magazine that went out to over 55,000 donors. (Not sure if I can post links... but message me if you want proof!)

*The Wrong*

1) **Don't let the money go through you.** 

* I fudged up hard by just getting everyone to give to me, and then donating it all to the charity myself. 
The money should never go through my/your hands. People were right to question my integrity, and I don't blame some for withholding donations. Find a way for the money to go straight to the charity you are supporting.

2) **24 Hour streams are hell**

* My gift is not staying up late. I hit a immovable wall about 16 hours into a stream and my voice goes full adolescent. If I had the chance to do it over, I would do two 12 hour streams instead. That way, I would't try fueling myself with three 5 Hour Energy drinks trying to entertain 4 people who likely passed out. (Btw, they did NOT equal 15 hours of energy.) I think it would be better to do two 12 hour streams, that way your core is always present, and you are on your A+ Game. 

* Or maybe you are a night beast who lives on sleep-deprivation, if you are, then sack up and go 48! Some can, not I. I am a day man.

3) **You are raising more than money**

* Awareness is a big deal and **you never know who will come into your channel and will leave changed** because of your message. 
**Give them a place to go.** I did not do a good job of doing research on major mental illness organizations in the country, places that your average citizen could volunteer, or helpful sites for people who just want to learn more. I knew of NAMI, but more was required. **Spend time thinking how you can effect others when the stream is off.**

* Mental illness may be a special case, as it is so widespread, but I had so many people come into my channel who opened up about their depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, etc. My mods, nor I, were prepared. Raising money was great, but we had a wonderful chance to help the very people we were raising money for. I greatly regret not having mods/friends/people, in the chat, designated to responding to those reaching out. I'll never forget scrolling through past message, seeing a viewer confess suicidal thoughts, and no one responding to him. I was playing smash bros with the amigos and missed it. 



That's about all I have! Forgive my grammar, I am an engineer by trade! Hope this help and thanks for reading!

5t7s8s,I want every streaming tip under the sun from viewer retention to drinking water. Lets make a thread here and I'll go first.,"About you:

Eat and sleep well, you need energy to be the best you.
Have a 5 minute meeting with yourself before you stream and plan out things you want to include in your stream. Anything that is important to you (Remember to thank each follow, make sure I change scenes each time, don’t tilt, focus on a fun vibe….etc.)
After your stream ends spend 5 minutes reviewing what you did well, what you did poorly and what you can improve on.


Network:

Spend time in other streamers channels. Just go hang out, be a friendly guy and expect nothing from them. Don’t ask for a host, don’t plug your stream. Just go in there and chat. Over time you form a relationship then you can politely mention you stream and go from there. 
About the viewers:
Make sure that I give each new follow special attention. Ask them anything or make them feel included. I believe that when you get a new person follow your stream you have a window to create a connection with them that would otherwise scare away lurkers.
Use viewers name as frequently as possible. Just like in real life people adore it when you use their name. Instead of reading out “I had the best day today” Read out “James614 just said he has the best day” that connection has helped me a lot.


About your goals.

Set goals. Actually set goals. Use the S.M.A.R.T acronym (google will help you here)
Set them in terms of concurrent viewers, follows and subs. Or, whatever other avenues you feel are important such as reddit, twitter, Facebook etc .

Finally my last tip, which you will either hate or love.

COPY OTHER STREAMERS. Now, I’m not saying go out and do exactly what they are doing.  Find a stream that is doing well for whatever reason and ask yourself why. Break down the things that they do verses the things you do. There is literally thousands of people out there that have a different take on the same thing you are trying to do. So go learn from them. 

Now please GIVE ME YO TIPS, literally anything that has worked for you big or small!!

5t1vtz,Ready to call it quits.,"I have been streaming frequently for over two years now. I've barely broken 8k views and 300 followers. The most I have ever had viewing at one time was 24. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. 

I have invested in my PC so that I can stream everything in ultra settings in glorious 1080p (even though Twitch has me locked at 720p because I am not partnered). I got a green screen and taught myself how to use it. I have animated backgrounds, I market my link in largely populated groups on Facebook, occasionally on Twitter. I don't get it. 

Random visitors stop in to tell me it is because I suck. I'm old (34 so I am not young anymore but I don't feel old at all other than some aches and pains) and I'm fat. Yeah, when you lose a leg and can't walk for nearly 5 years you tend to put on a bit of weight. 

When I started streaming it was because I was gaming 8 to 18 hours a day anyway trying to occupy my mind away from reality of my very long motorcycle accident recovery. I was gaming all day might as well stream, right? Lucky for me time really does heal all wounds and I am very happy with my life now. 

I've been walking for about a year now even though it is painful. I met the love of my life and we have a medium sized family and everything in my life is finally amazing again. The only thing I have left that causes me grief is my failed stream. It deeply depresses me that I can't get more out of it. I feel like it would be a healthier decision to just walk away at this point.

This is my final cry out for help. Unless this post sparks some kind of miraculous inspiration for me, I think I am done. Sorry for the book and if you made it this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT:

The fact that this post even has a positive score speaks volumes of this community. Thank you all so much for all of the advice. It really means so much you guys took the time to respond with so much positivity. I am going to step back and rethink my branding. If that gets the results I am looking I will gladly keep streaming. If not I understand streaming isn't for me and I can be perfectly fine with that. Again thank you all so much, you have all touched my heart deeply today.

5sqdq8,Would something like this be cool/useful?,"Hey guys. I had an idea one time after realizing how entertaining salty streamers were. 

Basically in my spare time I've been making a website that would allow you to browse for new twitch channels based on ""Moods"". How it works is it parses the chat in hundreds of channels, and if for example the PJSalt emote is used or the word ""salty"" is said it will consider it a ""Salty Mood"" Channel. It will then rank the channels by which channels use the certain keywords the most.

5s92b4,"Scene Maker - A free tool to create and customize your own scenes (intro, AFK, outro, etc.)","Hey /r/Twitch! For a long time I've wanted to make something that people could use to make and customize their own intro, AFK, in-queue, or outro scenes without the use for Photoshop, Gimp, and other image editing software.

**Useful Links**

[Get the Scene Maker here.](https://nerdordie.com/product/scene-maker-free/)

[Example of scene I created.](http://imgur.com/a/YUc5T)

[Full walk through video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZikbHghK0Q)

[Full written guide here.](https://nerdordie.com/free-resources/free-scene-maker/)

**What's all included?**

You'll be able to download files that will run your scene locally on your computer. You'll be able to use our settings generator to customize the following features:

* Custom Background images or video + blur on backgrounds
* Add Your Logo or Branding Image
* Custom Colors for your fonts, frame, background overlay, and more
* Ability to use nearly ANY Google Font
* Stream Labels such as your Recent Follower, Tippers, and subs
* Built in animated schedules and social media popup
* Scaling of certain sections
* Countdown timer and messages
* And much more!

You will need to create an account on my site to use. This will allow you to track any downloads you've made, and helps reduce spam etc. to my site.

**Known Issues**

Background videos will not loop if they're too long. In this case, I recommend adding in your video directly through OBS Studio.

Performance issues with videos inside of OBS browser.  If you don't have a higher end PC there will be noticable frame drops due to blur effects and color mixing. I suggest here that you also add your video directly through OBS Studio.

This is only fully tested in OBS Studio. Most features should work in any software that allows you to ""import"" local webpages. But, some features may not work as intended.

**Planned Features**

In the near future I'd like to add the ability to import your settings file into our settings generator. Making it easier to edit future scene designs.

In the future I'll also be releasing more templates for designs as well. Ones with higher levels of animations and some other features that were left out of this base design.

5rp65j,The last twitch guide you'll ever need.,"
Hey everyone. I'm here to tell you how to go from a twitch zero, to a twitch hero. 

First let me start off asserting my authority on the subject matter. I'm a streamer, and I've been streaming for a while, literally straight. I never stopped. I've had multiple viewers. Multiple. You heard me right. I'm willing to share all my awesome secrets, on how I got my multiple viewers(A non-zero number baby).


1. Boobs. tits. Chesticle Spectacles. Honestly I'm not sure if these help or not. I don't have a bachelor's in boobology or masters in mammaries so I'm by no means an expert on the subject(but let's pretend I am). If you have them good! If not, and you really want to try it, craft some up! Balloons, Water Balloons, Rice, Sand, Tissue paper! The possibilities are endless! 




2. Grills. You need a grill. If you aren't lucky enough to get be a grill(most of us aren't) then you have to buy one. Go to your lowe's, home depot, hell walmart, everywhere sells grills. Why? Because everyone wants grills. This includes twitch. Charcoal, propane, other. Doesn't matter. You don't even have to turn it on(if you do, open a window because your streams about to be hot). Just put it on screen somewhere, anywhere. Pose with it, or just let it sit there. It doesn't matter. They eat that shit up. I don't understand what it is about them, but grills really get their dicks hard.




3. Networking. You gotta network. ""How do I network? What is networking?"" you may be thinking. That's ok. That's why you're here. First get a router. Boom. Step 1 is done. Step 2 go into everyone's stream. When your there make sure you just casual mention your stream went well(you don't actually have to have been streaming, but if you weren't/aren't, your not doing step 4 right(You've already read this full guide right?)). Make sure everyone in that chat knows you're a streamer. You can engage in some casual conversation but do so at your own risk(no more than three non stream related lines I always say), because it might distract them all from the fact that your a streamer. When you leave, make sure you mention your stream again. Also, join every discord ever and hop around servers. That way people can see that your streaming(ideally, they should know you stream, and that you're streaming, if you are following steps 3 and 4 hard enough).  Social media is a great tool for this. Use you twitter to let your favorite streamers know you stream. Keep it casual though. A simple ""Hey, loved your stream last night. Kinda like what happened in my stream xxx day"" is enough. Nice and subtle. CCNP certs a bonus.




4. Always be streaming. Never stop. Ever. you've gotta be super. Stream Until Popularity's Evidently Raging. Stream when your gaming. Stream when your cooking. Stream when your sleeping(that's somebodies fetish!). Literally never stop. I'm streaming right now while I write this. never stop. When your not online, somebody else is. Those viewers could be your viewers! Every second your not online is a second you'll never get back!





5. Guides. You've followed every step(especially 3 and 4 and 2 and 1) and you're looking for more. Good news. There's another. Guides. Not reading them(unless it's this one), but making them. Make a guide. ""But how am I supposed to make a guide?"" Easy. Copy people. All the guides are the same anyway. So go out there and find one use their points, just change it to your words. Did you go to highschool? Do what you did there. Here's an examples. ""Always be streaming, and never be offline"" -&gt; ""Stream always and never be not streaming"". Boom. It's a whole new sentence. Heck, rewrite this guide. NO ONE WILL YOU CALL YOU ON IT, AND ESPECIALLY NOT ME. IN FACT WHY ARE YOU EVEN WRITING A GUIDE WHEN YOU CAN JUST COPY THIS ONE ""but no one will listen to me! i don't have credentials"". It's ok. you've streamed right? You're a streamer that's enough. Even if you haven't, you know the word streaming. THAT IS ENOUGH. 




6. Video guides. So you've done number 5. Good, but also bad. Print is dead and no one reads or writes. Like you might have literally been the last person. I don't even think they do that in schools anymore. I didn't even write this, I talked it into my phone(love ya baby).  This morning I had alexa order my god damn groceries. So that take that sonbitch and put it in a video. Everywhere you put that written guide, put the video. Put it places you didn't put the written guide. Everyone will love it.



7. Infiltrate all communities. Post your stream everywhere. I mean really whore yourself out. Now I know what your thinking ""But some places have rules against advertisements!"", but that's okay. Because there are loopholes. Look for places where you can have a ""signature""(or here a ""flair""). This is basically legal add space. Did you set that up with your stream? Good. ""But people only see if I post"" Shut up! I know that! So post! ""But I don't know wha-"" IT DOESN'T MATTER. Post anything. Post Everything. You don't have to contribute. Let people know you laughed at there comment with just an ""lol"". It's not about your comment. It's about the sweet sweet clickity link for your stream. I can't stretch this enough. JUST POST ANYTHING. 




8. Defining your brand. Now this one is a hard, because not many people sell brands every where. I was lucky and found a site in texas. Sold great branders. Could buy them in bulk(you only need one though) and had a nice little paint tool in the window to design the shape. It only took two weeks for mine to get here. The hardest part was finding somebody to brand me. Most people are bit a hesitant to place glowing iron onto human flesh, and I was a bit to squeamish to do it to myself. But after a struggle I found someone in my local BDSM clique willing to do it. It was painful, but my brand is what sets me apart from the others!



There you have it. The ultimate guide how to stream and get twitch famous. That's all you'll ever need. When in doubt Just follow steps 1-7, especially focus on steps 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8. 

Now that your armed with this knowledge your da best(cept for me).


Edit.

5rhphf,Applying For Partnership,"Two of the broadcasters that I’m friends with have been doing well recently, and with that success, they’ve started looking at partnership. Even with new viewers coming in and some promising channel growth, they aren’t the largest channel on Twitch, and the situation left me thinking about what a channel looking at partnership wants to focus on. I ended up with a few practical suggestions for channels actively planning to apply. For everyone else, I also typed up some general information about Twitch Partnership and what Twitch is looking for in potential Partners.

*****

#**Practical Suggestions for Partnership**

**Size Matters:** Twitch doesn’t have any good way to pick out quality channels other than positive word of mouth or growing channel size. In a perfect world, the partnership team would be able to look at a channel for hours and divine its true potential. In the real world, they likely get thousands of applications weekly and a few minutes to decide whether to take a better look. Do whatever you can to make them take that better look.

* **Make Smart Game Choices** - In the weeks or months before you apply for partnership, go with what works. You want to show signs of consistent growth over a reasonable period, so play to your strengths. For at least a few weeks, play the types of games that you know viewers like watching you play. Settle into a niche where you can enjoy yourself and grind out some growth with a new community.
* **Get Your Name Out There** - It’s easy to get caught up in your own broadcast when you’re improving your channel. But if you only focus on you, it’s easy to miss out on the larger Twitch community. Put aside time to watch other broadcasters and have a good time. Speak up in chats, be active on social media, and help others make their communities better. It’ll keep you sane and keep your channel fresh in people’s minds, which has benefits in the long run for any channel. 
* **Ask For Help** - Let people know that you’re pushing for partnership. Don’t expect everyone to sell your channel or give you constant hosts. Don’t encourage your community to message Twitch staff and beg for your partnership. But letting your community know what you’re doing might encourage people to tune in when they wouldn’t otherwise. And at least a few other broadcasters might give you the extra bit of support you need. If you’ve got no community to appeal to, you aren’t ready to apply for partnership, and if you’ve got no social network to speak of on Twitch, you need to stop and fix that immediately.

**Tighten Up Your Content**: If you have the raw numbers to actually draw a second look from the partnership team, make sure you show something worth looking at. A great first impression grabs new viewers and it’s the same for anyone looking to evaluate your content. 

* **Update Your Branding** - A look at your channel should convey who you are and what your content is about. It should get people excited and remind them about what they’re in your channel to see. If you have no sense of your channel identity, potential viewers and the people evaluating your channel won’t either. Hopefully, you already have that vision of your channel identity, so this is the time to update graphics and consider getting some professional work done to make that vision a reality.
* **Get People Excited** - Find ways to make your community active and involved. A quiet, lurking community can be a good thing, but excitement has real merits. Activity in chat draws new viewers in. Activity on social media expands your channel’s reach. Creating an atmosphere where your viewers are invested in making the channel better improves your community and shows a positive channel direction that someone looking at your channel can pick up on.

**Apply The Right Way**: Applying for partnership is applying for a job. You don’t ask for a job or expect one. You actively show a prospective employer why they NEED to hire you. You’re doing interesting things with your channel. You have ideas and direction! There are plans you have underway and Twitch has a good reason to invest in your success. Put those reason into words. Keep it succinct. You need to be able to convey, from a brief look at your channel and application, that Twitch has a reason to change their relationship with you.

Remember that everyone wants partnership, but you need to explain why Twitch should want to partner you. If you have a huge number of viewers, that’s a solid reason in itself. But for smaller, growing channels, having a reason beyond “my channel is growing and I’d like to be partnered” stretched into 5 paragraphs puts you far ahead of the rest of the pack.

*****

##**What Is Twitch Partnership?**

Twitch Partners act as the face of Twitch. They are a curated group of broadcasters that Twitch promotes and enables. Most people will have their first exposure to Twitch through a partnered broadcaster. They are, in essence, contracted talent meant to be representative of what Twitch offers and at the forefront of innovation on the platform.

Partners get access to a collection of site features that allow them to improve and monetize their content. These include:

* **Guaranteed transcoding** options: These take a broadcaster’s source video and re-encode it at different bitrates to allow viewers to choose a video quality their internet can accommodate.

* **Monetization options**

 * [**Advertisement Revenue**](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/880219-seasonal-trends-in-advertising-and-revenue): The ability to run commercials on their channel. Partners are compensated by a through a flat-rate CPM (cost per thousand) specified by their contracts with Twitch. This means that partners will receive a set amount of money for every thousand advertisements served.
 * [**Teespring Program**](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1766516-twitch-partner-merchandise-store-playbook): Allows partners to sell customized channel apparel. The shirts are directly promoted and advertised through the Twitch store.
 * [**Cheering**](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/2449458#How exactly does Cheering support the partners?): Cheering allows viewers to tip a broadcaster using “bits” purchased from Twitch. Every bit cheered at a broadcaster translates to one cent of revenue given to that broadcaster.
 * **Subscriptions**: Allow viewers to support a broadcast through a recurring monthly subscription. Subscribers gain access to Twitch-wide channel emotes, a custom subscriber badge, and a variety of other possible options including ad-free viewing.

* Access to a [**priority support queue**](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/735178-partner-help-and-contact-information)
* Possible direct Twitch promotion (front page promotion, Twitch Weekly, retweets, etc.)
* Beta test access on some new features
* Networking opportunities and improved business contacts

*****

##**Stated Guidelines**

The [partner application page](https://www.twitch.tv/partner/signup) states the general requirements for those interested in the partnership program. It is possible to achieve partnership without meeting these requirements, and it is also possible to be denied partnership despite exceeding them. From the application page:


&gt;To qualify as a Twitch Partner, we look for:

&gt;* Average concurrent viewership of 500+ (not just a one-time peak).

&gt;* Regular broadcast schedule of at least 3 times a week

&gt;* Content that conforms to our [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/terms-of-service) and DMCA Guidelines

&gt;Minimum broadcast requirements are a general guideline. Exceptions are handled on a case by case basis. We're always excited by broadcasters who stream unique games!

*****

##**Perspective on Partnership**

According to the 2015 Twitch retrospective, Twitch peaked at 2,113,999 unique monthly broadcasters. Their partnership page points out there are at least 1.5 million active broadcasters. And of those users, less than 14,000 were partnered by the end of 2015. Encompassing less than 1% of the active, broadcasting channels on Twitch, the Partnership Program is incredibly exclusive. 

With all the benefits it has, it’s easy to see why people want partnership. It’s also easy to forget that partnerships are a business arrangement that need to benefit Twitch as much as they benefit broadcasters. Transcoding is expensive to provide, requiring server space and maintenance costs. Just the process of onboarding and maintaining data for additional partners can get expensive rather quickly, without even considering the costs for additional support or promotion for those broadcasters. Justifying those costs means selecting broadcasters that Twitch can reasonably expect to represent Twitch well and grow.  

At the same time, recognize that partnership has become increasingly more accessible since its creation. The program launched in 2011 and the listed requirements for partnership have dropped significantly since then. I remember a time when Twitch wanted a regular viewership above 2,000 concurrents. Since then, the threshold has dropped to a listed requirement of 500 viewers, one which is regularly stretched to much lower numbers. The system may not be ideal, but it has changed to accommodate many more users as resources have allowed.

*****

##**What Twitch Is Looking For**

###**Numbers**

The guidelines requiring 500 regular, concurrent viewers are understandably intimidating to many streamers. However, they aren’t a hard rule. Remember, you’re thinking about your partnership application as a job application. Every job has its stated requirements. But, it is usually possible to get a job without meeting all of those requirements, and meeting those requirements on paper doesn’t guarantee you the position.

Average concurrent viewership over a period of weeks or months gives a general picture of a broadcaster’s popularity. It helps determine whether a channel is growing, gives a reasonable estimate on potential revenue, and helps measure the potential for future growth and opportunities. 

There is definitely some minimum threshold on concurrent viewership that most potential partners will need. I usually see broadcasts with anywhere between 150-300 regular concurrent viewers achieve partnership. I’ve seen more heavily trafficked broadcasts be denied, and I’ve occasionally seen channels with less than 100 regular concurrents be partnered. Generally, you should expect that bringing less concurrent viewers to the table requires exceptional performance in some other way.

One major point on numbers: the viewership you attract needs to be both legitimate and your own. Twitch has tools to detect when a channel is likely receiving illegitimate traffic, and viewer engagement is considered before granting partnership. Planting several hundred botted viewers in your channel isn’t sufficient. That said, hosting is a perfectly legitimate tool for building an audience, but simply receiving a large number of viewers from repeated hosts isn’t enough. That temporary viewership bump needs to translate into retained viewers of the channel. Integrating viewers from hosts into your community is a necessity if hosting was a significant part of your channel’s concurrent viewership growth.

###**Content Quality**

Multiple things feed into broadcast quality. Obviously, having acceptable audio and visual quality is important. Even more vital is the way your content is put together, combined with your personality and commentary. Anyone can put together a decent looking capture setup with acceptable stream quality. It is much more difficult to create content that has the ability to engage an audience.

Broadcasts that are ready for partnership should have a clear sense of what draws in their audience and entertains them. Every channel has a reason why viewers are attracted to it. You need to know what that is and understand who will be drawn to your broadcast. You can solidify that with solid branding that cements an image of your channel in the mind of your audience.

That doesn’t mean you need to have gimmicks or be showy. It does means that everything should feed together to give your channel a sense of identity and give new viewers a reason to watch. A strong personality who creates great videos, with attractive channel visuals and a distinct sense of what their viewers respond to, is someone who will grow on Twitch. That’s someone that Twitch wants to enable. Everything you can do to bring your content closer to that ideal is something that improves your channel and makes you a more eligible candidate for partnership.

###**Direction and Community** 

Partnership is never the end goal. The biggest thing you can do to shoot yourself in the foot is treat it like the finish line. It’s easy to rest, become complacent, and eventually stagnate when you don’t have a direction your channel is moving forward in. Always work towards something. Having goals and new projects keeps your content fresh and interesting. Work on those goals and create new plans for content as you achieve the old ones. In a perfect world, that sense of direction should show through in your channel’s content. If not, it’s something to highlight when you apply for partnership.

Understand how you plan on using partnership to facilitate those goals. That should be something beyond “partnership will give me transcoding options and help me grow my audience.” Know how your branding will influence channel emotes and what you’ll do with the new avenues for growth that partnership might open up.

Very importantly, don’t forget about community. That goes for both your direct channel community and the general Twitch community. The people who watch your channel, love your branding, and understand how your broadcast works are the backbone of your Twitch presence. That strong sense of community in a channel is easy to pick up on. It attracts new viewers to the channel and gives a good idea of the value partnership brings to a channel. 

At the same time, be active in the general Twitch community. Collaborate with other broadcasters. Network constantly and raise your brand awareness on Twitch. Find your way to make Twitch better. Knowing the right people may not assure you partnership, but creating excitement about your channel and content is a step in the right direction. The right people being excited about some of the best content on Twitch might be the bump that a smaller channel needs to achieve partnership.

###**Other Notes**

Don’t be discouraged by rejection. The worst thing you can do is be paralyzed by failure. If you stop there, that’s it. Successful people realize that rejection gives you an opportunity to reflect on how you can improve. Use any feedback you might be given. Work harder, try new things, and eventually you’ll make something better. 

You need that attitude to succeed on Twitch. A channel that doesn’t receive partnership is not a bad channel. But a broadcaster that refuses to improve their content probably isn’t the type of broadcaster Twitch wants partnered. Figure out ways you can make something greater. If you have genuinely good content and think you’re close, follow up with your rejection letter. Don’t try to place blame. Instead, ask what you can do to improve. Many times, you’ll get a response with concrete feedback that you can use to implement changes. Give those changes some time to make an impact. When you can definitively say your channel is better for it, re-apply. 

*Note 1*: Twitch should get back to every partnership application, usually within one week, two at most. If that hasn’t happened don’t worry too much. Just reapply after a few weeks have passed. It’s possible your application simply fell through the cracks.

*Note 2*: If you do decide to reapply, wait at least a few weeks, preferably a month or so before you reapply. You’re looking to show sustained growth and change, which is unlikely to happen in less time. And like with all human beings, it is possible to annoy the people who are looking at your application.

5qu88n,Help with harassment?,"There is a Twitch Partner that is constantly harassing me. The report function hasn't done anything for me. I never go in to this stream... but he continuously says terrible things about me using my twitch username so I can be found. He has 287k followers... what he is doing to me is not okay. With every thing he says, the people that are subbed and follow him have whispered me constantly trash talking me... calling me a hoe and slut... telling me I need to kill myself... I have turned my whispers off but they follow me in other streams and do the same there. He has also given out my social media accounts so his followers can find me there and harass me as well. I have had to make everything private, but can still be contacted through twitter by just ""@'ing"" my username. My social medias were not known on twitch until he directed his followers to me. Every time I stream, I am on a stream, or stream that I go into it happens. We do utilize the ban feature and have to have verified accounts. I do know that this is the internet and these things do unfortunately happen, but the attacks are because of this Twitch Partner... and the report feature has not helped whatsoever...

Today, I streamed for about an hour until one of my few regulars showed up and mentioned my mic had been freaking out. Checked it. My Blue Yeti (for some reason) was set at 100 volume (which if you know how that is. It's definitely not good quality). I've been streaming for days trying to get people to come in and chat. When in all reality. I was probably blowing their ears out.

Breaking 1.5m (peaking at 1.8m+ on sunday) 3 days in a row is pretty crazy, and twitch is easily on track to break 2m+ concurrent during the finals of this CS:GO major.

5pn012,Yandere Simulator - Lack of Response,"I'm not going try and spearhead this as some kind of righteous cause because I just don't know enough about the situation but I think it is something worthy of discussion.

What exactly does Twitch base it's video game ban-list guidelines upon?

A games actual content or it's perceived first appearance?

If people are unaware of what I'm talking about there was a recent video submission via the video game developer Yandere Dev in which he discusses his games initial ban on twitch and his following experiences trying to start a discourse through official channels to find answers to rectify the issue.

I'm not going to link to the submission itself because that seems to be against the rules in this sub but if you're interested in the topic feel free to google/youtube or search reddit for the overall discussion.

There seems to be a great deal of subjective and bias selection going on within what is appropriate on twitch and what isn't, I could be entirely wrong but the fact that this is someone's passion project and lively hood that a great number of people are interested in that is being ignored, on one of the Internets largest viewing platforms to this day is fairly baffling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5pn012/yandere_simulator_lack_of_response/,1485154312.0,5462,0.87,805,Twitch,Loufly
5pltk5,My experience streaming as an introvert,"Hey guys first off I'm an introvert. I don't socialize much and only got like 2 friends IRL. I'm a person that doesn't really start conversations in school.Yet despite of those setbacks I wanted to start streaming so I could get better at socializing and sharing my opinion and passion for gaming. Have some fun discussions about the same interest with viewers. I'm not a person that talks to a whole group so its a whole new experience to me. I've been streaming for a few days now.

So far i think its going pretty decent I've had like up to 11 viewers, some viewers stuck around for awhile. So far I'm really enjoying streaming and trying to talk as much as possible. I think streaming is really fun but also exhausting since I never really talk this much to a crowed. Also streaming in English while its not my native Language. I try to keep a flow and talking but sometimes there's a silence too. Although its sometimes hard to keep talking I think this is a skill in time I can get better at the more I play while talking. Sometimes I get people in chat to talk but also there's a lot of lurkers that just watch.

I'm still hoping to improve my social skills and overall as a streamer and become more open and share my passion for gaming with other people! I've gotten several people to stuck with me for hours so I must be doing something right!

5oyzh3,"To those who ask, ""Can I stream with _______""","If you have that question, here is my main advice. **Try.** Thats the FASTEST way you will find out. Chances are you already have OBS/Xsplit on your computer if you are asking the question. So setup a stream which should take you no longer then 5 minutes for testing purposes, and see for yourself how the stream looks.

I constantly see on here multiple times a day, posts of people asking if they can stream with: their current PC, internet, graphics card, setup, etc.

These are EXTREMELY easy things to just look up online. Not only will you get a much faster answer that I can promise has already been tested, but you wont clutter this sub up with the same question asked every single day.

Asking if you can stream with your setup is like asking if you can drive your car at 60MPH/KPH. Every car can do it, but some can reach that speed much faster then others. While a computer may struggle trying to stream Skyrim, it could very easily stream an emulated SNES game.

The only time nowadays someone cant stream is if you have say a .75mbps upload. Thats pretty much the only case.

Streaming is a YMMV setup, so just do yourself and others a favor, and try it out first. Try all the different settings, look up what they do. Thats how you learn, thats how you will get good at streaming because your settings will be perfect for **your** setup.

Edit: Just to give some of you who were planning to ask this some insight, I have streamed with something as low as a laptop with an i3 processor thats over 3 years old, Intel HD 2000 GFX Chip, and 4GB of ram. The computer itself couldnt even run LoL without constant frame drops, but I could EASILY stream games up to PS1 titles.

5ooumk,What Kind of Streamer are you?,"Hi everyone!

A few months ago I posted a SATIRICAL list of the different types of Twitch Viewers, and this one is dedicated to you/ us :D

Much like last time I want to invite you to add to this list.

**Types of Twitch Streamers**

**The Overlay Genius:** Do you like watching game play that is covered with a dancing GIF of a pokemon? Well this guy is right up your ally. Their screen looks like they commissioned that Vince guy from the ""Sham WOW"" infomercials to create it for them.

**The First Timer:** Go easy on them OK. Its probably their second stream ever. Their MIC sounds like a mix between a zombie gargling mouth wash and a teacher scratching a chalkboard. The stream DC's 5 times in an hour because of bit rate issues, but they will be back tomorrow streaming league of legends....and....wait.....they added a donation tracker? #NewChairFund

**The Grinder:** They are the gandolf's of Twitch. 5 years of activity, streaming 7 days a week, but more bitter then your mother after she had you and had to drop out of med school. They will blame all their problems on everyone but themselves, but in the end they are the meat and potatoes of the Twitch community. 


**The Speed Runner:** This is the guy that got beat up in grade 9 for telling his Math teacher that he was in love with her in font of the whole class. They can finish a Super Mario Run in 2 minutes, but it takes them at least 4 years to work up the courage to ask a girl out for Ice Cream. Do you have a question about the game they are playing? Well fuck you you casual..... we don't have time for that! They create amazing communities around games that came out when you were just an after thought during your parents prom night.


**The Boob Blamer:** This streamer is a dime a dozen on many of the ""Live Stream Fail"" subs. They have been streaming for a fucking long time man....like 2 weeks at least, with no mic, no cam, playing a game that no one wants to watch, but its the girls with their boobs out that are ruining their career I TELL YAH! Eventually they will switch to Runescape and pluck their eyebrow hairs for donations.


**The Scaper:** Playing a game that came out 10 years ago is a gamble.......do it in a duck costume with a swastika on your forehead though and watch the profits roll in. They are a different bread...a diamond in the rough...or maybe just an old bleach bottle in the sandbox...we are not sure. They revel in chat participation, and will do just about anything for 100 bits. Bring your wallet with you and have a great time at their expense.


**The Follower Obsessed:** They love numbers. They love them so much that all they do is talk about their follower count, and how they want you to make it bigger. Every 5 minutes or so the tiny robot AI that controls their brain forces them to blurt out the benefits you get from following their channel. Free Discord Access? A night with their wife in their marital bed? What ever just SMASH THAT FOLLOW BUTTON GUYS!!!


**The Drama Whore:**  OMG did you guys hear what Shadydude69 said in Party_Cucks Discord yesterday? Fuck no of course you didn't, because you probably don't care. Well this streamer's rabid fan base of 13 year old's do. Minecraft game play for this streamer is nothing but a background for their teeny bopper soap opera they have going on in chat every day. They say they ""hate it"" but its the blood that flows through the veins of their community. 


EDIT **ADDED**


**The good guy streamer:** This guy is streaming because his friends told him he should. All he wants to do is help people do things they haven't done because they never have the team. Every second of the stream is useful advice or talking with chat about the decision they made and how to improve on their own. This is one of the reason twitch is amazing.


That's all I got for now. Add away and I will include them in this post :D

5oigwm,STOP Using Follower only mode as a new streamer!,"Why???? I like to search out newer less popular streamers to enjoy..and lately I am seeing an increase in streamers with 10 - 20 followers using follower only mode for chat -_-

1.  Any new person who comes to your stream is most likely just going to be turned off by this and leave. Its as if you are holding new people hostage just so they follow and can chat.

2. Its all about community growth at this point in your career, and putting chatting, (The most important thing for a smaller streamer), behind a wall is CRAZY!

It boggles my mind when I see this. IMO follower only mode is a tool to be used by people with solid viewership, who just want to either do something special for their loyal fans, or slow down the chat to make it readable.

But someone with under 100 followers, putting new people behind a ""follower only mode"" chat seems completely un reasonable don't you think?

EDIT::::  This option may be on by default for new streamers -_-

EDIT: Here are clear instructions on how to turn it off :D

Followers mode is like sub mode and is set via chat commands.
/followers [duration] - Enables followers-only mode (only users who have followed for 'duration' may chat). Examples: ""30m"", ""1 week"", ""5 days 12 hours"" Must be less than 3 months to turn on.

5nqrli,How to Use a DSLR as a Webcam!,"[Like this! (gif)] (http://imgur.com/HgBIdwd) and [this! (pic)] (https://imgur.com/a/Uh95N)
  
*HeyGuys* ZombiUnicorn here. Been running this DSLR setup for about 8 months now and it still looks amazing, my camera is fine - no sensor burnout or any issues at all. Every day I get messages from streamers asking how I set this up so easily (and I will make a video tutorial soon, but figured I'd share here as welI).  
  
I use my Canon t3i with a 30mm Sigma lens. I connect it to my PC via **mini USB cable** (not HDMI, not through a capture card, but directly to the PC). I then use a program called **'SparkoCam'** to capture the live view. **SparkoCam** has a watermark on the free version, but there are multiple license options to choose from and it is sooooo worth it.  
  
Since it is only capturing the live view and not recording anything, **there is no damage to the sensor.**  
  
I've run entire 24hour streams with no issues at all. You can adjust the settings to the camera within the app, but I recommend to go under *sources&gt;scroll down and uncheck ""restart live view every 25 minutes""* or else your image will lag every restart for a moment.

5n8nwe,"Dear Twitch, re: TwitchCon","First of all, THANK YOU for announcing the location nice and early! For anybody not in north America, the extra few months allow for cheaper flights, which eats up a large chunk (50% in my case) of the cost of the trip.

5n3hu6,A warning about !Weather,"Today, I was on a stream that I frequent (1100 followers). The streamin question has a !weather chat command through NightBot that pulls the weather for a certain location and post it into chat. The streamer used his Zip/Postal code for the weather location (i.e !weather 12345). Within 3 seconds, I was able to punch his the zip code and his last name (found on PayPal) into Google and have his home address, his phone number, his SO's name, among other information.

**Therefore I Caution you:** DO NOT put your home postal code into the !weather command. Disguise your postal code, or use your city or city nearby.

I immediately whispered this streamer and let him know of his mistake, he immediately felt shocked and dumb that he did something like that without realizing how easy he could be trolled with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5n3hu6/a_warning_about_weather/,1484030008.0,143,0.94,20,Twitch,TheLordJames

5mxz5c,"I've been working on a tool I'd like to share with you guys - it's called Multistreamer, it's a free, open source, self-hosted webapp for simulcasting video streams","Hi there /r/Twitch!

Lately I've gotten into simulcasting my video streams, and I've been using Nginx with the RTMP add-on for relaying video streams to multiple services.

It worked well, but I got frustrated with having to log in to multiple services to update metadata in multiple places, and having to keep multiple tabs open to monitor chat/comments/etc. Plus, I do a show with other guys who might want to run OBS on their end, and I know they're not interested in learning how to use SSH, edit nginx config files, etc (and honestly, I don't want to give them the ability to reload the Nginx config on my server). I wanted something they could use, too.

So I made this webapp, it runs in Nginx with the Lua add-on (or if you prefer, OpenResty). The idea is this:

* First, you add your accounts for your different streaming services - Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, as well as arbitrary RTMP urls.
* Then you create ""streams,"" which is a collection of accounts
  * Each ""stream"" gets its own stream key
  * Generally, I create a new profile in OBS to match each stream
* Sometime before you go live, you login to the webapp and update all your metadata. Game being played, broadcast title, etc.
* When you do go live, the webapp will reach out to each streaming service and update metadata

Additionally, it provides an IRC interface for keeping tabs on your chat. You can login with any IRC client, when you go live, you'll be ""force-joined"" into a chat room. As people chat/leave comments/emote they'll appear in the chat room. Additionally, you can respond to chat/comments from that chat room.

If you have a group of people on a stream, the chat room is particularly handy. You can all login to the IRC interface and chat amongst yourselves in the room *and* interact with your viewers all in one spot.

Anyways, here's the link! https://github.com/jprjr/multistreamer/

I have a slightly out-of-date video of me demoing it here. I need to make a new one that shows off some new features, but this should give a good idea about how it all works: https://youtu.be/rjaTaHm4WkA

[Basic Concept in an Image](http://i.imgur.com/nJu96v7.png)

Hey Streamers, I've been building this small tool and some of you might find it useful. It serves up a webpage with your currently playing Spotify song, and you can change the colors, position, font, etc... You can then put this page into your stream using BrowserSource in OBS. In the latest version you can also login with Twitch and the song2stream bot will idle in you chat, and respond with the song and artist name when viewers use the !song command.

The app is still in an early build, so it's not as pretty as it will be in the future. I'm also open to questions, ideas, critisisms and feature requests so leave a comment and I'll do my best to respond to everyone.

Enjoy!

**Updated: Jan 11th 2017**: Any user's who got stuck at 'Checking Spotify Status...' can download the latest version and it will connect just fine. Cheers!


EDIT: This application works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

5lobwr,Losing my job Live.,"A few months back I would go live every day after I got off of work. I had a great time even though I had very few loyal viewers, I enjoyed being part of the community and watching other broadcasters play the games I love and chat with other viewers with the same passion that I have.  Honestly, it felt great being able to broadcast and be able to share the experience of a new game or humiliation of a defeat in Overwatch, I would have to say it was the best months of my life. That is until that day... 

That day I came home, fired up my computer and started my broadcast and went on my merry way attempting to achieve that ever elusive dream of becoming partnered. I do believe I only made it forty minutes into the broadcast when I got the call, it was my manager... I was being fired and was told not to come into work the next day and to just drop off my computer at the security desk... You couldn't tell by how I came back on the mic, but I was truly devastated. I powered through the broadcast and signed off not letting my viewers know that I was about to erupt into a panic attack.  Thank god I wasn't using a web cam that day.


Little did I know, that not only would that be my last regular broadcast for several months but I would find myself homeless for a few weeks, being forced to move in with family in California and all but give up the ability to broadcast regularly. I found that although I couldn't broadcast myself, I found refuge as a viewer to some of my favorite streamers. I wouldn't always be able to chat, but I always found a way to watch. I miss the lifestyle and I damn sure miss being a full part of the community.

It's been about six months since I lost my job, became homeless, and learned what it really meant to be alone. I may still be jobless, I may still have to live with family... I still apply for jobs on a daily basis and I do odd jobs around the neighborhood trying to earn what little I can, but I always miss the life of being a broadcaster. I'm not sure how, I'm not sure when, but I will figure a way to get back online, because let's just be honest.... I'm addicted to Twitch.  I guess the question that keeps nagging me is, would it even be worth it anymore? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5lobwr/losing_my_job_live/,1483399003.0,144,0.76,35,Twitch,[deleted]

I named my stream title ""Ask me anything"" and after 10 minutes one guy came in and started asking me a bunch of questions. It was pretty fun. He suggested I use discord. I couldn't figure it out so he made a server and we talked for awhile. And then 4 other people joined the server and we're all talking and having a good time. Two of my guests found out that they share a friend in common even though one guy was from the USA and the other guy was from Norway. It was awesome to see how small the world can be. We all ended up talking for 2 hours. 40 people came to visit, 6 people decided to follow me and I made a new friend.

5l9pa4,"To grow in 2017, USE DISCORD. Here's why and how.","Let me say first and foremost that if you are not consistent in your schedule or are not continually improving yourself as a broadcaster and entertainer, then you are severely limiting the effectiveness of any tool or strategy you try to use. Really. You have a mic, you might have a cam, you want an audience, so you need to first learn how to put on a show. 


  With that out of the way DISCORD is the best tool for streamers out there IF you are willing to learn how to use it right. Why? It works, its everywhere, its aimed at gamers and streamers, they've had a solid year catering to us, and if they stay on this path, it will only become better.


  Here's how to use Discord.

* Use it as a home base for your own community of viewers to hang and make a stronger connection with in between streams. 


* Use its voice chat to easily chat with when playing with viewers. (With video coming, this opens up opportunities for more exclusive things for loyal viewers, or as sub perks)


* Network with other streamers and develop a hub of Discords that you use to cross promote and be active in... OR


* Have one Discord that houses several streamers or a Team to make interaction and planning easier, and becomes a better melting pot of combined viewers to have fun with. Voice chat makes things easier here as well.


* You can find many other streaming communities that use Discord as a means to connect like minded people together. Goals include learning from each other, finding people to game with who understand streaming, and supporting each other in ways that go beyond just follows and hosts. Being involved with several discords is as easy as can be, if you can juggle it.


* [Discord Bots](https://www.carbonitex.net/Discord/bots) can tailor the experience you want the people there to have with polls, games, game-specific integrations, [service integrations](https://discordapp.com/streamkit), information sharing, memes, music, and can even be set to alert people what you are playing and when you (and whoever you deem worthy) go Live on Twitch. If you've built a community of engaged people, this can be a HUGE benefit.

* If you create content on other platforms, like YouTube or social media, you can make Discord a hub for all of that content (much like a website, but easier :)  )


It is super late for me so I am sure there are other things I am not thinking about that can be done though Discord. I am in no way affiliated with them, I just have a desire to share what has made the biggest impact for me this year. I'm sure this can be duplicated on other platforms. Networking as a streamer is best used when you build relationships with people that you, in one way or another, can make great content with. For people wanting that ""secret,"" there it is. But surprise surprise, it will still take WORK to take full advantage of what is possible. I'll say this from experience: IT IS WORTH IT.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5l9pa4/to_grow_in_2017_use_discord_heres_why_and_how/,1483191791.0,374,0.91,98,Twitch,CASTorDIE

It'd solve two problems:

You could even have 3 sliders if they have their own music and game sound and their voice.

[Recommended Encoding Settings](https://i.gyazo.com/f126b594af9d941490713e6fa6ace6e5.png): Tick x264 for encoder. Tick Use CBR. Tick Enable CBR padding. The higher the max bitrate is the higher quality the stream will be, but if it's too high your viewers may not have good enough internet to watch the stream. If your internet can handle it I would recommend 3500. If you don't know your upload speed you can test it [here](https://beta.speedtest.net). Each thousand kilobits will use 1 megabit per second of your upload speed.

**Optional Settings:** Save stream to an mp4 file by going to broadcast settings and [ticking Automaticallly save stream to file and choose a file path](https://i.gyazo.com/c15557e4d7708ad5fb023c45682a3eb7.png) (end the file path with the name of the file, for example **video.mp4**)

##The **Updated** Free Countdown for Twitch Streamers

*Hello again everyone!*
We could not wait any longer to show you guys our **updated** countdown timer!
For those who missed the 1.x, we are two IT engineering students that for chance encountered a streamer in need of a nice timer for his upcoming marathon. We overkilled it back then and we did it again.

[**TwitchTimer**](http://twitchtimer.com) is easy to use with OBS and Xsplit and being fully integrated with Twitch and Streamlabs, this clock picks up automatically when your viewers subscribe/follow or donate and updates the timer, amazing them with one of the ever-incrementing animations (currently 107).

Check out everything at out website [twitchtimer.com](http://twitchtimer.com)

We heard your requests and implemented those and more!
We love to hear your feedback, for anything contact us!

**As always, Happy Streaming!**

*Luca and Tommaso, TwitchTimer's developers*

###Primary features:
* **Cooldown**: perfect for marathons. You set a starting time (e.g. 24 hours) and you let your viewers increment it at your price.
* **Countdown**: thought for events. As above you can pick a time but your viewers can now crumble away the time.
* **Timer**: useful for speed-runners. It is not an high-precision chronometer but it shows the time elapsed since you fired it.
* **Clock**: a normal clock. Kind off. It shows the current time. Except when it suddenly drops acids and transforms into Nikola Tesla.
* **Syncs**: *followers* and *subs* from Twitch and *donations from Streamlabs*
* **HIGHLY Customisable**: color, background, font, show this, hide that, really, we could not guess what else could become customisable. If you find anything, just let us know!
* **Custom animations**: we create an AI, yes, a freaking machine learning AI, to convert your logos and images into animations. To learn more about this just check out our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/twitchtimer)

Any feature missing? *Please do let use know!*

### Patron support
We put much effort into this project as you will certainly notice so we decided to create a [**Patreon page**](https://www.patreon.com/twitchtimer) where you can help us create the feature you love, keeping them **free** and *survive at Uni* while gaining nifty rewards like personalised animations and more :)

We really do consider important your feedback. If you'd like to submit your review, just write it to any of our contacts and we will publish it on the website and medias!

5k3bys,Some of my thought for hopeful streamers...,"I'm not a pro streamer, but I am a pro stream watcher. 

I see lots of threads asking; How to be a streamer? How can I get viewers? What am I doing wrong? What game should I stream?

So let’s get to it…

* ***What game should I stream?***


First, just know that you should play what you like. Do not try to stream a game because it is popular or ""people watch it"" because they still won't stay to watch you if you're not into the game. Why would I watch a streamer that seems to have no interest in the game, or perhaps does not even like the game? Speaking for myself here, I come to a stream usually to see a game that I have, or one I want to be better at. Or perhaps, a game I am thinking about buying. 

* ***How can I get viewers?***


You should be interactive. Talk about the game. Why do you like it? What are you trying to accomplish with it? Answer questions about the game, or how you play it. It may get annoying to answer the same question over and over, but I am going to leave if you belittle me for asking a question. I may have just entered the channel, how was I supposed to know I was the tenth person to ask in 5 minutes. Use bot commands or moderators to help you with this. 

&gt; Now this is not law, if you don’t want to talk to the watchers, &gt; don’t. If you just like to pop in and play an hour or two and &gt; put up a stream so people can watch it, then by all means &gt; DO THAT! There are people that want to see a game and don’t &gt; want to hear music and people droning on and on too….haha,

 You should set a schedule and keep it. How am I going to watch you if you stream at 1 pm on Monday, 7am Tuesday, 11 am Wednesday, midnight on Thursday... you get the picture. If that's all you can do, do it. But don't expect a large core group. You probably just catch random people looking around. 

* ***What am I doing wrong?***

I see so many hopeful streamers say ""there are already streamers with a huge following in my game"" or ""my game is over saturated"" This is one of, if not the biggest mistake a potential streamer will ever make. Only YOU, will stream like YOU. You will always have ZERO viewers if you do not hit that broadcast button. Why isn’t there just one or two Counter strike, Hearthstone, or Minecraft streams? Because the audience is big enough to support more. Heck… If everyone said this, we’d have a real small community.

 Who's to say people in that ""huge"" stream won't like you/your stream better? There are games I LOVE to watch but I do not really play. I also like to watch a person that is good at a game I have so that I learn new things. But there are streamers that I do not like to watch. Also, I very seldom watch the ""top"" or front page channels. Unfortunately, I cannot subscribe to every channel I like. And we all know BIG streamers sometimes do subscriber only chat. Well I am probably going to go to a channel that I can talk in, and ask questions in. Unless the streamer is really doing something special.

 Just know, your potential audience grows daily. The ""viewer"" numbers are not fixed, and locked to any channel, or streamer. 

 This medium is the NEW television. I really believe that. And like TV, viewers will go where they are entertained and enjoy the time spent.  Your best stream will be a stream where you like the game, and are comfortable interacting with viewers. Stay consistent and you will grow.

 To give you an idea about my demographics, I am mid to late 30s male in NA. I watch more Twitch.tv and YouTube than regular television. Now just think of the potential viewers for the younger ages 12 - 30. If this medium is getting middle aged men, and I am sure I'm not the oldest dude here either... your possibilities are endless. 

Speaking of younger ages, this is another option to think about for viewers. Keep your stream clean and you could have more younger views. As a parent, I'll let my son watch you, even on a semi violent game if you're NOT cursing and trash talking players or the viewers. 
 
So, don't be discouraged. Ultimately, have fun. If you have fun people will most likely join in for the good times.

Just my views as a stream watcher pro. I hope this helps someone. See you in your stream sometime! Good luck

5jz79g,I made a handy tool for streamers &amp; let's players,"Hello /r/Twitch!

I've made a tool that will allow you to easily keep track of highlights or notable events during your stream/recording sessions!
What the application does is allowing you to set up a hotkey to press whenever something happens during your stream/recording session that you might want to later look back on when you're in the editing process.

You'll also be able to set up a hotkey to start/stop the timer, preferably you'll want to set this to whatever your hotkey is to start/stop recording in your game capture software (OBS, Xsplit etc).

I've also set up filename formatting in the same way OBS has, so you can save your time stamp log file (as a .txt) to the same folder you save your actual game footage video files. If you set up your log filenames to match your video filenames they'll always end up next to eachother in your folder, so you'll know which log belongs to which video file.

I know from experience that if you record gameplay for very long periods of time, it's very annoying to go back and go through hours of footage to find that one funny thing that happened. Well, now you'll know the time stamp to go to.

The application is completely free to download &amp; use. You can get it at [www.CapKey.net](http://capkey.net)

I will try to keep up and read people's thoughts and requests on this as much as I can. I probably need to create some kind of venue for that.

Big thanks to the mod staff for letting me share this with you guys.
I hope this is useful to some of you.

Thanks!

5jpzc2,How one viewer can change everything.,"Just a post to thank the viewer who has given me the most motivation I've had for anything in a while!

I was streaming a relatively unknown game called ADR1FT (A space disaster survival game if you want to know) and as usual my viewer count was 1. (Me watching my own stream to make sure it looks ok)

Half an hour goes by and I see my view count rise to 2. Someone is watching!

This viewer then starts using chat and we start having a conversation about random stuff, drinks, memes etc etc and this goes on for another 2 and a half hours until I finish the whole game! This one person stayed on my stream, chatted with me, laughed at my jokes, enjoyed my content and now watches every stream I run.

It is exactly what I wanted in a stream, enjoying a game whilst chatting with my audience, laughing with them, helping them with questions they have, really connecting with each and every viewer that comes along. These are my ultimate goals and I wish to have that connection to every single person that takes the time to come by and support an incredibly insignificant Twitch channel.

Since then my stream viewers has risen to maybe 10 on average (A damn site better than just me!)

This has given me such an enormous boost to my motivation and makes me want to stream more and more, reach a greater audience and entertain more people. Not just on Twitch though, it has real life implications, I'm more chatty around people and can make conversation much easier!

It's really amazed me that talking to just one person, chatting with one person, laughing with a complete stranger who has no voice, no face, just a username on the internet has given me such a boost.

This is exactly what I needed and I have Twitch to thank for it!

So thank you Twitch and to my newest fan, you've helped me more than you can imagine! &lt;3

I went to stream on twitch yesterday to see how it feels now and it was great. Transcoding for the audience right away, folks got notifications even though I haven't streamed here for months and months, the dashboard looks great, delay and lag were both good, and chat was fun.

5icaf5,The single best advice I can give to all Streamers,"So I streamed for about 3 months a year ago and was able to create a decent following fairly quickly, but it then stalled and due to work and other obligations I had to put it on hold. I started back up again about a month ago, but I also did so with a completely different mind set.

===

With that said, let me rewind a bit. When I first started (a year ago) I went in with the mindset of creating a fun environment/community. As time progressed the hunger to grow faster took over and I focused more on the flashy stuff (overlays, notifications, etc) and slowly fell away from what helped me grow. I cared more about a donation and viewing stats - and felt I ""deserved"" more. 

===

Fast forward to my reboot and I tried my best to learn from that situation. If you don't do it for the fun/joy of it, it is EXTREMELY hard to grow organically. With that said, I am not saying to not do things to help grow such as networking, etc, but you need to always keep the core values the same, otherwise the dedicated viewer will see right through you. I have had so much more success (and FUN!) this time around and I cannot stress enough the importance of this. Sure, I am thrilled and very thankful for new followers, donations, etc, but I am not expecting them or working solely for them. These mistakes are what hurt most viewers from growing and it is one of the hardest things to turn around from. I hear people all the time saying you can't go into it wanting to make it a career, it just needs to happen. I wouldn't go that far, but you need to have a fun first mentality and not push or expect any of the perks with it. 

===

If this helps even one person, I'll be happy with my learning experience :)

Game on! &lt;3

Chrome has a lesser known feature that lets you open a web page as it's own window and it works really great for the new dashboard. Here I show you how to get it set up along with a couple tweaks using the Stylish browser add on to remove some clutter from it.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/D4NJo0L.png)

#Text guide

1. Get Chrome  
2. Get [Stylish add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) for Chrome  
3. Go to Stylish **Manage Installed Styles** and hit **Write New Style** on the left  
4. Press **Import** on the left and paste in the Stylish script from [this pastebin](http://pastebin.com/LMmQVhne)  
5. Give the style a name like Twitch Dashboard in the upper left  
6. In the bottom right where it says **Applies To URL** change USERNAME_HERE to be your Twitch username  
7. Hit **Save** in the top left  
8. Copy the link from **Applies To URL** and open it in a new tab  
9. In the top-right of Chrome, open the menu and go to **More Tools** and then **Add To Desktop**, ensure **Open as Window** is checked  

You should now have a desktop link that opens the Twitch dashboard with the left and top menus of the page hidden by Stylish

5hylob,"Introducing AutoMod, a Moderation Tool for Creating a Positive and Inclusive Chat Experience on Twitch","&gt; Twitch chat could soon be a lot friendlier: today the streaming service is introducing a new automated tool that’s designed to create a “positive and inclusive chat experience.” The moderation tool is called AutoMod, and according to Twitch it uses a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to both block content deemed inappropriate and flag potentially troublesome content for review by a human mod later on. (Such comments will be held in a publishing queue until they get the go-ahead.)

&gt; AutoMod will be an opt-in feature, so you won’t see it on every channel, and Twitch says that streamers will be able to adjust how heavy the chat filtering is depending on their personal preference. AutoMod joins a relatively robust set of moderation tools on Twitch, which let streamers do things like ban specific words, links, or phrases; employ community moderators; force users to view a set of rules before they can chat; or make it so only subscribed users have the option to be part of the discussion.

&gt; “For the first time ever, we’re empowering all of our creators to establish a reliable baseline for acceptable language and around the clock chat moderation,” says Twitch moderation lead Ryan Kennedy of AutoMod. Twitch says that the feature has been in the works for several months, and in fact a trial run of the feature was employed during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, which aired on the streaming service.

&gt; Currently the full version of AutoMod is only available in English, but the tool is also in beta for multiple languages, including Arabic, Czech, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish.

5hmzb4,Something cool happened tonight,"I only have 18 followers, so I'm practically nonexistent on the Twitch universe. However, out of these 18, and for the last year, I have one viewer who almost always watches. He's talkative in the chat, helps me in games when I ask, joins in sometimes, and is all round a really nice person. I've always appreciated him and even if I stream for hours and get no other viewers I can still rely on him to make it worth my time. 

So tonight while I was streaming, the topic of childhood games came up and I mentioned I had an urge to replay Sonic (it'd been on my steam wish list for a while now and I was waiting for it to drop in price to buy it). He only went in my steam wish list and gifted it! He said ""I didn't know how else to support you so I gifted you a game"". 

I know a lot of you get frequent donations/gifted games so it might not seem like such a huge deal but it made me feel so chuffed today. It's just the idea that a stranger out there likes watching me play games and talk nonsense for hours on end, enough to spend their money on me.

The game is like £15 so by no means cheap, and it meant even more to me because I know he's a university student (made me feel kinda guilty tbh).

I feel lucky and appreciative when people simply watch, so getting that game was such a lovely surprise. 

Just goes to show too, its not all about the numbers. I have such few followers and viewers but the ones who do talk and support me are more than enough to make streaming fun for me.

I chose XSPLIT gamecaster originally because it was a very simple program to use and I was new to streaming and OBS just seemed more complicated at first.

I switched from XSPLIT gamecaster to XSPLIT broadcaster six months ago, and went on a path of constant tweaking and improving my stream. I had constant problems with XSPLIT just not working properly or not being compatible with shadowplay or various other things. I could never get my green screen to work or look good with XSPLIT.

When XSPLIT took a dump on me today, I re-downloaded OBS. After almost a year of gaming and streaming and tweaking things and learning the best bitrate, etc, I finally understood everything enough to try OBS. It took me less than an hour to download and completely setup OBS just the way I had with XSPLIT. I did my first stream tonight with OBS. The video and audio quality was significantly better. People in my chat were specifically commenting on it. Also... my camera and green screen came through basically perfect. XSPLIT just couldn't get the job done.

OBS is free. I have no idea why I have used or paid for XSPLIT for a year. I just wanted to tell streamers that OBS is the way to go. It's worth learning how to use. I cancelled my XSPLIT subscription tonight, literally three hours after downloading OBS.

Here is a recent stream recording using XSPLIT...https://www.twitch.tv/donniepcgames/v/104486246

Here is last night's example of me using OBS for the first time using the exact same setup. You can really see the difference in Chroma key and overall quality...https://www.twitch.tv/donniepcgames/v/105611721",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5grymz/obs_is_greater_than_xsplit_and_how_dumb_i_feel/,1481016174.0,188,0.94,96,Twitch,donniepcgames

5gi9bb,What are the top 10 games you think every variety broadcaster should stream?,"I just had a random thought - if I was asked from a new variety streamer what games they should stream (and assuming they had no qualms about genre) what would I say?

My list is a bit of a cheat since instead of choosing individual games I have series (I mean c'mon if you play Metal Gear Solid 1 then you gotta play the rest).

If you wanna include why you made your picks do that as well! Maybe we can help each other out and open our eyes to new possible games to add to our stream lists!

I made my choices based on:

&gt; A. **Viewer Interaction (VI):** a games that will actively involve chat in your playthrough because you can take their suggestions and input for game decisions or use their chat names in the game. You could also consider multiplayer games for this as well, but for my personal list I stuck to single-player games.

&gt; B. **Reach of Possible Viewership (RPV):** A game that is popular and thus has a chance of garnering a larger audience than other games, especially if you are performing a blind, first play through. Blind first play throughs are, imo, the bread &amp; butter of variety streamers.

&gt; C. **Vicarious Viewer Repalying (VVR):** people will watch this game for the experience of replaying it for the first time through your eyes.

&gt; D. **Spontaneous Streamer Content (SSC):** a game that allows you to generate entertainment value from your input - examples being voice acting characters or creating a story from the choices you have made in your simulation game. There is value in this because rather than just generating your streamer entertainment value solely from game content, you are tapping into your own creativity to create ***unique content*** for your stream.

&gt; E. **Jump Scares (JS):** Viewers love to watch streamers get jumped scared, especially for games where they know when the jump scares are coming.


1. Soulsbourne Series (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1 -3, Bloodborne) - **RPV** &amp; **VVR**

2. Metal Gear Solid series - **RPV** &amp; **VVR**

3. Resident Evil Series - **RPV** &amp; **VVR**

4. Game Dev Tycoon - **VI** &amp; **SSC**

5. Outlast - **VVR** &amp; **JS**

6. The Sims series - **VI** &amp; **SSC**

7. Red Dead Redemption - **RPV** &amp; **VVR** 

8. Shadow of The Colossus - **RPV** &amp; **VVR**

9. Undertale - **RPV**, **VVR**, &amp; **SSC**

10. The Legend of Zelda series - **RPV** &amp; **VVR**

I don't feel my list specifically has to go in that order (other than Soulsbourne games being #1). OVerall, looking at my list, putting down the first 10 games / series that came to mind - it looks like I value blind, first play through over other types of games. Considering what I like to watch on Twitch, this doesn't come as a surprise.

I'm interested to see what you all consider to be must-play games as a video game broadcaster!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5gi9bb/what_are_the_top_10_games_you_think_every_variety/,1480891604.0,69,0.84,47,Twitch,Brawli55
5ge79e,"Twitch Ads basically taking control over browser (no mute, super loud, etc)","Ever since Twitch started baking their ad rolls into the streams themselves and not something an external program / pluggin like Adblock could stop, ads are RUINING the Twitch experience. When an ad plays, it plays at what I believe is about 120% system volume. I keep my Twitch player, which is set to HTML5, at about 5% volume since I'm usually playing a game myself when watching streams so I need to hear my game audio either at level or higher than the stream. However when an ad plays you go from usual sound level to omg rip-headphone-users level.

And maybe it's a bug, but I've tested this in two browsers, Chrome and Firefox, in a lot of ads the video player controls in HTML5 vanish. Since ads can't be blocked, especially the super fucking loud ones, I usually alt tab really quick from whatever game I'm playing, hit the mute sound button and unmute it in a minute or two when the ads are over. Sometimes though the controls fucking disappear. You can change tabs in the browser, open new tabs, right click on the video for the context menu but the actual playback controls (play, pause, sound, etc) just stop even being available during playback of some ads. If needed I can record this event happening with fraps as video proof but this ONLY happens when ads are playing, either it is a bug or its some safety built in feature that forces the user to watch / listen to the ad. The only way to get the ad to stop playing at that point is to close the browser tab or browser entirely. Are we seriously at the point that you have super loud audio ads that aren't skippable, can't be controlled volume wise and you have to close the damn tab entirely to make it stop?

*edit* Update, tried to mute browser tab as some mentioned, that didnt work, in Chrome or Firefox. Literally it's like the HTML5 player zones out completely when this happens and takes the browser with it momentarily while an ad blares at max sys volume. Doesn't happen with every ad, it's random. It's happened with the Xbox One S ad and some ad I think was about some online college? I wasn't really paying attention to that one but I couldn't mute the tab during either of those ads which again blocked all controls to the stream (couldn't mute stream, pause stream, etc). Chrome is running stock, no addons, Firefox variety of addons so I know it's not an addon issue and it's not a browser specific issue it happens in both. I mainly stick to streams I'm subbed too so I dont watch streams with ads often but I've been watching RLCS this weekend and this issue keeps coming up ;\ If I knew when it was going to happen (i.e. when their commercial breaks were) I'd fire up fraps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5ge79e/twitch_ads_basically_taking_control_over_browser/,1480832728.0,175,0.96,50,Twitch,mavgeek

5fwhec,AI that watches your stream and highlights interesting moments,"**UPD Dec 2:** 

Thank for your feedback and all your upvotes. We have hit our goal and are going to start development immediately. I will keep this thread updated with latest news.

**Original post:** 

Hey everyone! We are working on AI that can create stream highlights in real time. The idea is very simple in that we are going to use computer vision algorithms to watch stream, detect interesting moments and cut them into twitch clips automatically (we can deliver clip links to stream chat, so your followers can share them instantly). Afterwards it can create a video with all highlights and upload to Youtube, etc.

**I wonder if it would be valuable for you? If you think so, please vote or share your thoughts in the comments. If this post hits 100 points, we will make every effort to make this happen asap.**

P.S. It may sound a bit futuristic, but we did a small proof of concept and it looks promising. For those who are interested in the technical details, we are using OpenCV and ffmpeg to work with video stream and machine learning to recognise patterns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5fwhec/ai_that_watches_your_stream_and_highlights/,1480597991.0,144,0.91,48,Twitch,koskeller

5e6kom,"Reminder: As streamers, you can get in contact with game devs and request a copy of their game to stream, if you need help let me show you what to look for","Well first off, I help a lot of streamers on discord, and its really surprising how many people are unaware of how many game devs will give them steam keys to play on stream (no matter if you have 100 followers or 10,000)

And its actually a really simple process, just keep in mind a few things before you start asking for games.

1) You should have a email set up just for this purpose, and it should be on display on your twitter/twitch to verify that you are who you say you are in your email.

2) Keep the email and your social media/twitch professional looking

---

As for finding who to contact, well thats pretty easy

1) Start by going to the main website of the game or game dev

2) Look for something on the site that says ""Press / Media / Contact us"" or a ""Press Kit""

3) This will usually send you to either a page full of information, in which there will be a ""general"" or ""press/media/pr"" email, this is what you want 
&gt; Note: If they have a Press Kit page, there might be a little form to simply request the game right on there, no email needed just give them your twitch name and a bit of info!

4) Write your email! Nothing complicated but you should include a few basic things: A greeting, your name and twitch name,  on what system do you want the game, why you want to stream the game, your twitch and twitter links, and a little thank you for looking at your email!

**Edit:** 5) When you stream, post on twitter, tag the game studio, the person who gave you the game, they will show up sometimes and help, plus they like knowing the game actually went toward a stream.

---

Honestly, thats it. I started doing this when I had ~100 twitch followers and I got a bunch of games to stream, some people said no that I was too small, but after I grew a little I emailed them back asking to reconsider, and they said yes and were happy that I got back in contact!

There are also just some websites to request keys directly which ive had some luck with!

  Let me get some verbiage/definitions out of the way here to answer any questions before I get into the technical portion of the setup.    

**EMI** - (electromagnetic interference) is the disruption of operation of an electronic device when it is in the vicinity of an electromagnetic field (EM field) in the radio frequency (RF) spectrum that is caused by another electronic device. In this case it will impact your sound.    

**Ground Loop** - In an electrical system, a ground loop or earth loop is an equipment and wiring configuration in which there are multiple paths for electricity to flow to ground. The multiple paths form a loop which can pick up stray current through electromagnetic induction which results in unwanted current in a conductor connecting two points that are supposed to be at the same electric potential, often, but are actually at different potentials. In our case, in audio this will cause an unwanted hum throughout the entire system making you go insane trying to correct it, trust me I was ready to throw everything through a window.    

**DAC** – Stands for Digital to Analog Convertor. Converts Optical into analog.    

**Fader** – Found on a Mixer - Each channel has its own fader (slider) to adjust the volume of the channel's signal before it is sent to the next stage (subgroup or master mix).    

**Pre-Fader** – A pre-fader output is independent of the channel fader, i.e. the auxiliary output stays the same level whatever the fader is set to.    

**Post Fader** - A post-fader output is dependent on the fader level. If you turn the fader down the auxiliary output goes down as well.    

**AUX** – Most mixers include one or more auxiliary channels (often referred to as aux channels for short). This feature allows you to send a secondary feed of an input channel's audio signal to another destination, independent of the channel's main output.    

**Main Mix** – This is the main output of sound of all channels mixed into 1 output.    

**Mix Minus** - is an audio signal that is carefully designed to avoid feedback and echo in a conference or telephone interface application. Or sound isolated from a main mix.      

  **Connecting the PCs to the Mixer** – (This guide assumes you are using the 1204usb mixer)    

Make sure the Mixer, and both PCs share the same power outlet source. Make sure the mixer is within 6 feet of both PCs. This will limit any ground loop issues that can occur. Plug the USB cable from the mixer into the Streaming PC. Press the Main Mix down next to the headphone/control room volume nob so that sound will go to your headphones so you can actually hear everything.      

  **Setup Audio outs from PCs**    

1.Connect one optical cable to the optical out.  
2.Connect the other end of the optical cable to one of the DACs.  
3.Connect the RCA side of one TS to RCA cables to the DAC.  
4.Run the TS side of the cable into channels 5/6 for Gaming PC and 7/8 for Streaming PC.      

  **Setup the Mic Outputs**    

1.Plug one 1/4 inch adaptor into the AUX 1 out port.   
2.Connect the 3.5mm Y-Splitter to the adaptor.   
3.Plug one 3.5mm cable into the Y-Splitter and run it to a ground loop isolator.   
4.Plug the Ground loop isolator into the MIC input on the gaming PC.  
5.Repeat steps to setup the streaming PC same way.    

  **Setup the Mic MIX Minus (Assumes mic is on channel 1)**      

1.Turn the all aux(red)/fx(yellow) volumes down all the way for all channels. (This includes Aux sends)  
2.Turn the AUX 1(red) on channel 1 to 0db.  
3.Turn the Aux Send dial to 0db as well.  
4.Slide the fader all the way down on channel 1 and depress the mute alt3/4 button under Pan.        

Now that all of the crazy stuff is out of the way it’s time to setup your volumes. This is something I cannot assist with as each computer is different. I will say that the sound output on your PC should not ever be 100%. This will allow headroom to prevent channel clipping. I have my sound output set to 50% on both the streaming PC and Gaming PC and have adjusted the output to the main mix with the channel sliders on 5/6 and 7/8. Remember your mic is controlled by the AUX and not the sliders; you will need to turn the AUX Send up and down to your liking.      

  **Setting up OBS**    

OBS will be running on your Streaming PC. All volume setting should be at 100% inside OBS as the sound levels will be controlled by the mixer. Remove the streaming PC desktop sound output from the stream in Settings &gt;&gt; Audio as this is going into the mixer, if you don’t it will create a sound loop. Your mic should be set to Mic/Aux 1 and your Mic/Aux 2 should be line-in USB since the Mixer is sending the main mix VIA usb to your streaming PC. Basically Mic/Aux will be your mic like normal and Mic/Aux 2 will be all game and voip sounds.      

  You will also want to click on the gear just above the volume controls in OBS and convert mono to stereo for your Mic/Aux or your voice will only carry to the left channel.    
The main reason why I Mix minus the mic out of main mix is so that I can still use OBS noise gate which can be applied to the mic.       

  I hope this guide is clear enough. I will try to answer any questions and make edits to this as soon as I can. There are many ways to do this but I have found this to be the most effective and best sounding. There is a way to use the Alt 3/4 channel to send your mic to the streaming PC by using a TS to TSR out from the mixer to the MIC input on the Streaming pc which would eliminate the need for the splitter, but for most the splitter would be the path of less resistance and messing with the mixer to much.      

  Constructive criticism welcome.

5cgln5,How To Get the Best Settings with OBS / For your stream with tools,"There is about 3 new threads started every day on this subject at /r/Twitch witch is 1095 posts per year. Witch usually means 1095 different answers also.

Since there isn't any ""Best settings"" that works for every case. Getting the best settings for your stream is going to require some test streams. Where you test and figure out solo or with a friend when the stream starts to buffer and you can still play games.

This guide is going to help you in this process so you can get to streaming faster! :) I'll let you know some really common mistakes and suggestions that usually happens for everyone when starting out. So you can avoid them and get to the good part faster.

**Common mistake 1: Trying to stream at 60FPS**

If you don't have a i7 or equivalent for that. Your most likely not going to be able to stream and play well. Your stream will buffer and drop frames and the stream looks like a slideshow. Or your game starts to lag. Starting out 30FPS is usually really good.

**Common mistake 2: Bitrate over 3500+**

Maximum suggested bitrate by Twitch is 3500. Starting out streamers don't usually get transcoders either so you won't get the benefit from streaming at higher bitrates. Even if your internet speed allows it.

Your stream may also be considered as a attack to Twitch servers when your bitrate is too high and stream could be shutdown. I would suggest streaming maximum at 720p / 30FPS and 2500 bitrate. This way more people can watch your stream without buffering.

**Common mistake 3: Streaming on Wireless**

If it’s just possible it’s best to use wired connection when streaming. Streaming requires a constant flow of data that usually isn’t steady when being on wireless connection. More information about this at [OBS Forums](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/streaming-server-stream-key-not-found-picarto-tv.26339/#post-228340). If you are suddenly dropping frames try out a lower bitrate and see if it helps.

**Now let's get started - The journey for Best OBS Settings**

Okay, phew.. We got those spots sorted out really fast. So let's go on the good part! I'm going to let /u/NerdOrDie do the talking with couple videos and i'll link the tools your going to use under those videos so you can get the settings sorted out.

**Additional testing tips**

**Friend or viewer:** 

It's good to have a friend or a viewer watching your stream while you test these settings out. Many times the streamer has a better connection than the viewer and of source your aim is to make the stream enjoyable for the viewer. This way you can sort out the buffering issues faster.

**Setup a ballpark and increase:** 

If you want to go higher than 2500 or test out the 60FPS. It is good to first find the ""lag and buffer free"" spot first. Then you can increase +100 or more to find the spot that starts to lag. [Stream Settings Estimator](https://obsproject.com/help/estimator) should give a pretty good estimate for you already.

I live in Cali.  With the potential for Marijuana to become legal here will i be allowed to smoke it on stream if its legal / i have a prescription.

5a85n6,Host a Crocodile Hunter marathon in the same spirit of the Bob Ross marathon.,"While browsing /r/Videos I came across a Steve Irwin clip, and the nostalgia hit me so hard. As a Swede, Bob Ross was unheard of during my childhood, but Steve Irwin probably took up that same space in my heart. I'd never heard of Bob Ross before the Twitch marathon, but still watched that for hours on end during it because he was just so likeable.

I realized that both of those shows are quite similiar in one aspect: the actual content does not matter, as the host is the entertainment.

And as it is quite difficult to find episodes of Crododile Hunter, I wondered if it would be possible to Twitch to do a marathon of it, as they did with Bob Ross.

Now, I understand that the whole Bob Ross thing was to promote the ""Creative"" section of Twitch, but I still thought it was a good idea.

But I also realize that the license for Crocodile Hunter might not be cheap. I am guessing that ""The Joy of Painting"" was basically free, since all the episodes were uploaded to Youtube, which is not the case for Crocodile Hunter. So I thought Twitch might Kickstart this concept, to both get some money for it AND assess the level of interest it has with the community.

59ekup,Guide: Managing your USB bandwidth as a streamer,"Most streamers use a lot of USB devices like wecbams, mics, headsets, capture cards, etc. It's important to manage how your USB bandwidth is distributed in order to avoid audio/video dropouts, desyncs or even crashes.

I've released a modified version of USBView which helps you visualize which devices are sharing bandwidth by being on the same controller. You can then move your devices to spread bandwidth more evenly for the best results.

59ae87,"The Legend of Cory, the call center guy.","Holy shit, words cannot express how cool this is.

So, I've been having some trouble with my ISP, alright? Every night at around 1AM or 2AM, everything goes to hell. Dropped frames in OBS from low upload speed, really bad download speed, and just the inability to do anything. It even cuts out during this most nights, so I have to stream around it. Every time, at about midnight, I'll just have to end my streams.

It's been like this for months.

Tonight, I had had it. I've had like ten diffrent technicians come to my house, every cable in this place is now brand new, they replaced my freaking modem, and it's still happening.

So, I called my ISP's help line for the 15th time in two months.

This time would be diffrent, however.

You see, this time, I got hooked up with a guy named ""Cory.""

Let me tell you a little bit about Cory. Cory's tried the whole streaming thing. Found it wasn't for him. Said he just can't keep the words flowing like he wants to when he doesn't have viewers in chat. You know, the usual problem.

However, Cory understands. Cory knows that this shit's a big deal. Cory don't want no tech coming to my house this time to try and fix what isn't my house's problem. Cory escalates the problem to his supervisor.

So, now it's basically a conference call with me, Cory, and this really nice woman that can't understand what we're talking about when we start to discuss things like Dropped Frames, Packet Loss, and the like. Cory basically has to translate everything. Really sweet woman, honestly. Love her to death.

You want to know what Cory does? He asks his boss what they can do for me. What could they do for me? They could ""Test the node.""

Now, let me explain to you a little bit about what ""The Node"" is. The node is like a hub. It's where the internet comes from.

So, when I fire up a test stream (Titled as such,) Cory and his boss start to see something. Something big.

See, the node starts to receive my stream. They can see it receiving it through some kind of call-center-magic. But, it's weird. It's fine for the first minute or so, but that quickly changes.

Suddenly, without warning, the node goes haywire. Shits gets real bad, real fast. Node can't hold all them packets. Shit hits the fan.

So, all because of me, they've found that they may be replacing a whole freaking node. Great. I'm probably on some guy's shit list.

Nope.

You see, Cory's mah bro now. Cory tells me I should get a fucking medal for putting up with my little node doing things like this for so long. Cory has his boss do something for me.

I'm now on the list of people that get text messages every time things are about to get worked on near me.

So, now, every time techs are working on the poles anywhere within a one-mile radius. Anytime shit's about to get even kinda slow. I'm getting a text. I'm getting a message that says ""Yo, man. Don't stream yet. Shit won't work.""

That's not even the best part, though. Oh no. Cory's to good for it to end there.

The best part?

Cory: ""Hey, man. Before we end the call, why don't you give me your Twitch name. I'll come watch you.""

And he fucking did. I just saw the follower notification.

Holy shit Cory. You're a fucking legend.

594xi0,"Comcast's 1TB Data Cap is rolling out across the United States, beginning November 1st. This will GREATLY impact streamers on many different levels. Please read for more information!","Twitch is one of the biggest entertainment gates on the internet, and is a way for video gamers to entertain others, show off games great and small, and even brings communities together.

**This is all under threat from the looming Comcast 1TB cap rolling out**  

[You can read about it here.](https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/06/comcasts-1tb-data-caps-start-to-roll-out-nationwide/)  

[Here is the Comcast FAQ about the cap.](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/)  

*How does this affect everyone on Twitch?* 

* Any variety Twitch streamer needs to download video games, and most of us download them through popular platforms such as Steam, the Playstation or XBox stores, and other platforms. Many of these video games are not small. This will eat up a chunk of your cap.  

* Partnered streamers can, and usually do, stream at a higher bitrate. Pair this with the video game downloads, and you're seeing a larger chunk of your cap being eaten up.  

* Viewers who watch streams that broadcast at a high bitrate will also see their chunk eaten. If you do anything else, like Netflix, Youtube or Hulu, any pairing of these with Twitch can leave very little breathing room.  

*But I can get the cap turned off for $50 a month*  

**No one should have to worry about paying for a cap, and many can't.**   

This is a legacy mechanism resurrected to allow Comcast to rake in more money. There have been releases from Comcast [admitting that there was no congestion or utilization issues that justified this cap.](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/212376-comcast-admits-that-its-data-caps-are-a-business-decision-not-an-engineering-requirement) 

*So what do I do?*  

[Write a complaint to the FCC.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) If you stream, have this link posted by your chat bot every so often so your viewers can complain too. This affects **everybody.** Even if you don't believe you would be affected by this, you can still write in on behalf of those who are. No one stands to gain except Comcast, and everyone stands to lose. We must act to ensure we keep our internet free, and our Twitch awesome!  

*Is there anything else I can do?*  

Write to [your Senators](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?OrderBy=state) and [your Representatives](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) for them to apply pressure to the FCC board, and ask them to help push through legislation that classifies internet as a public utility.  

Of all the communities on the internet, we can help ensure a better internet for everyone, regardless of whether they're involved with Twitch, and we can ensure our community is able to push forward with awesomeness!

591mo3,Switched from Turbo to Twitch Prime - Lost Past Broadcasts,"One of my fears came true. I've been a Twitch turbo user for over a year, and had an extensive backlog of streams in my 'past broadcasts'. Twitch Prime released, and because I already had Amazon Prime, it was a no brainier that I drop Turbo to save money. 

I connected Twitch Prime, waited about three or four days, and then cancelled Twitch Turbo. Now, all my past broadcasts are gone. This happen to anywhere else? Reached out to support multiple times, didn't hear back. Kinda sucks. I don't really expect to see those past broadcasts again, but if this is an issue - i wanted to make people aware before they switched. 

Edit: Nov. 30th, 2016 - Never got any of my past broadcasts back, was told it was a bug and there was nothing that could be done. Never heard back from Official twitch support after 3 tries. Have been with Twitch Prime only since, and I do seem to be retaining my past broadcasts up to 60 days. Shitty situation, but I have a back log of broadcasts now so it's all good. The only thing I really lost was the chance to highlight a few things that happened. But I can go over that. Hopefully this didn't happen to anyone else.

57mai0,What I Learned from Streaming 2 Hours a Week...,"Hi twitchers,    
    
I have a mildly tight schedule: full time (I guess you can say ""career"") job, looking to get IT certifications, looking to complete a second Bachleor's degree, and weekends dedicated to the gf. (and everything in between: gym 5 days a week, chores, errands, 2.5 hour commute to/from work, etc)    
    
So it gives me a small window to stream about 2 hours tops a week. I know that's not much to even warrant making a twitch channel, but video games has been a life long passion for me. At first, I streamed for my [IRL] friends who either A) didn't have the chance to play with me B) just were entertained watching me play.    
    
Then I slowly gained followers (I have about 15 atm) and eventually built a streaming PC (I used to stream using the XB1/PS4 twitch app). Now, streaming has become an immensely satisfying hobby of mine, it's not going to be a job, or an everyday thing, but I cherish every time I do have the time to stream.    
    
It feels quite humbling. Especially compared to the people I follow that stream 5x a week for 4-6 hours at a time. Oh how I envy you. LOL.    
    
What I learned from streaming is to make that one stream a special experience. Now I'm nowhere as animated or charismatic as 99.8% of other streamers out there, but I like to try to have my viewers make them feel they are watching an epic movie premiere once a week (full of laughs, tears, hype, rage, salt, and everything in between) versus watching 5 episodes of an average tv show.

57g2bu,The life of an introvert on Twitch.,"Many people think that an introverted person is a shy, quiet, anti-social person. Well, I think that's a common misconception. Introverts enjoy the company of others, are outgoing, and instead of shy, I'd use the phrase ""If I don't know you/want to know you, then leave me alone"".    
    
I am an introvert. I enjoy going to lounges, parties, sporting events, etc, but not every other day. I like to have time to myself to just unwind, which usually means either streaming or watching other streams.    
    
But being the introvert that I am, a few things on twitch sorta turn me off. I avoid channels with large, talkative audiences. Sure, I can simply not see the chat, but when I want to talk to the streamer or viewers, I don't want to have to worry about having my message drowned in the chat. I usually stick to streamers with around 1-25 viewers.    
    
I don't like extremely outgoing/loud/over dramatic streamers. , It sorta comes off as phony like acting fake in order to promote themselves. I like to laugh, get hyped, cheer (and jeer) the streamer and viewers, but overall, if you scream, cry, whine, or even act overly nice, I'm probably not going to hang out there for long.    
    
I don't mind you saying hi and starting up a conversation if I'm lurking, because I will respond and reply back. But if I'm lurking and the first thing you say is ""Hey man, if you like what you see, drop a follow, big thanks! Sub or donate if you really want to help out!"" ....cya.    
    
As a streamer, I usually average 1-4 viewers per stream. Sometimes they chat, sometimes they don't. When they do, I like to read aloud what they say, respond, react, discuss, thank them for the follow, etc...but I feel if I ever get to the point to have 10-20+ viewers all chatting, I probably would be overwhelmed, especially if I'm playing a game that encourages focus.    
    
Well, I thought I'd share my pov as an Introverted twitcher, hope to hear from some other introverts/extroverts/every in between! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/57g2bu/the_life_of_an_introvert_on_twitch/,1476447792.0,128,0.77,64,Twitch,[deleted]

576apl,PSA: The Windows 10 Anniversary Update is causing issues with OBS. More info and workarounds inside.,"**OBS Forum Megathread with explanation &amp; workarounds: https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/psa-for-windows-10-anniversary-update-users.55256/**

Microsoft recently released an ""Anniversary Update"" (AU) to Windows 10, which is a fairly major update to the operating system. Since the update, a bug with the way the Windows 10 handles VRAM has started causing issues with users who were exhausting the VRAM available to them on their GPU. 

Essentially, when running OBS (a graphics application utilizing the GPU for rendering) and a VRAM-heavy game at the same time, it's possible for users to exhaust their GPU's available VRAM. Typically, when this happens, the system attempts to leverage system RAM to make up for it. With the Anniversary Update, something changed such that this overflow process now breaks something, causing the graphics driver to crash or freeze.

If OBS has been crashing, freezing, or locking up for you seemingly out of nowhere starting within the past couple weeks, and you have Windows 10 AU, you may be experiencing this bug.

572jsh,[Guide] Improving Speech and Talking to an Empty Room,"Hi there! So I recently came across [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5708s3/what_is_your_biggest_struggle_as_a_streamer_big/) discussing the struggles of the streamer, both big and small. One of the things I saw people struggle with is speaking to an empty room or just maybe talking during a stream in general. Many people post about asking for advice on those things as well outside of that post.

I thought it might be a good time for me to re-post a guide I made a year ago since I've gotten back into streaming after a long hiatus. I apologize if it's quite long but I'm someone who enjoys being pretty damn thorough when writing articles/guides haha. I updated the guide with additional examples and tips!

Hope you enjoy and get something out of it!

***~Guide to Speech Improvement and the Monologue Mindset~***

I wanted to make this guide for one/two of the more overlooked skills a new streamer should work on; the ability to speak properly and speaking to an empty room. We all have/had to do it at some point as a streamer and it's one of the foundations of having an entertaining stream. Not only that, the skill of speaking properly is a great one to have in the outside world! I'm not trying to offend anyone by making a guide about something as simple as speaking, but it's something I think most newer streamers don't realize it's actually quite difficult to do properly when they start out.

*Disclaimer: I should add that just like channel growth, people will ""level up"" their speech skills at different rates and what may have worked for me, might not for you! This isn't a ""get successful"" post but rather a tool-box for you to utilize to the best of your ability, so keep that in mind :)*

**1. Confidence**

This is the main thing that will be driving your skill, not only as a speaker but a streamer. People are naturally attracted to others with confidence, and when it comes to speaking, a confident speaker has the ability to draw people in.

The common phrase ""Fake it till you make it"" applies here, especially to those who are a bit more anxious or shy. Not everyone is confident and some people just can't get over that; but you can't get into streaming without expecting some hard work. Faking confidence can help build real confidence. Sounds a bit silly I know but it's true.

So how do we become more confident? Here are some things to get you started on:

- Posture/Body Language - I like to promote healthy living on my channel and as gamers/streamers, poor posture is quite a common thing. It's easy to start to slouch when spending so much time on the computer. Not only is it healthy to work on a good posture, it adds to confidence! Sit up, head up, shoulders back, etc. makes you feel more confident. (Visit [THIS PAGE](http://blog.highperformancelifestyle.net/proper-posture/) for a really great and extensive guide on posture). Additionally, adding body movement to accent what you're saying can help you drive certain points towards your viewers. Streaming is a visual thing, and a streamer who is more dynamic is more interesting to view than someone static. When we get nervous we get tense, and it can show through our body language. Actively engaging in proper posture also engages our mind more and streaming is a very energy demanding task so you'll be able to focus more on chat/gaming by sitting up rather than leaning back in your chair.
- Keep a log of successes - Too much are new streamers focusing on that viewer or follower count. I've fallen prey to this, and still struggle with it from time to time. It can lead to feelings of failure or going nowhere. However, overtime I've begun to shift that focus on the numbers to a more positive outlook and it helps! Whenever you have a great moment in stream make a note of it, physical or mental. Doesn't matter how big it is whether it's someone stopping by and talking in chat for a bit, or you gained one follower for the stream. Feel free to do this out of streaming as well. Overall positivity in your life is good to increase!
- Smile! - The physical act of smiling helps us feel better! There are many health benefits to smiling but it also makes you more attractive (oh my). As viewers, we can tell when a streamer isn't having a good time and it doesn't make it appealing at times. But walk into a stream and that streamer is smiling, laughing, having a great time playing his/her game? You'll want to keep watching! A smile can help change not only your mood, but your viewers and happy viewers = happy streamers. Hell, I don't stream with a webcam anymore and I still smile when I'm enjoying just sitting there playing my game. You'd be surprised as to how it can improve your commentary as well.

Don't just practice these things during the stream. Confidence is great on AND off stream! It also helps with my next topic:

**2. Enunciation/Diction**

As someone who used to be quite the mumbler, this is one of the main reasons I started streaming and it's helped a ton. Just as speaking confidently is important to attract an audience, as entertainers we need to be clear as well. When trying to speak to an empty room it doesn't matter if you can keep talking 24/7, if people can't understand you, they're not going to want to stick around to decipher your speech.

Here are some ways to improve your speech:

- Listen to yourself - Recording your voice and hearing how you sound to others is the first step to figuring out what parts of your speech need improvement; whether it's speed, clarity, tone, etc. it's hard to do when you're listening to yourself in your head. We all sound differently to ourselves than how others hear us. Recording yourself reading a short story, a monologue, or small passages from your favourite book can help pinpoint things to work on.
- Tongue Twisters! - Fun to do, and are a great warmup to make sure you'll end up speaking clearer. I don't need to tell you how to do those really but google some tongue twisters, preferably the ones that utilize all the letters of the alphabet. Focus on speaking clearly, and slowly work to speed afterwards. That being said, speed isn't everything!
- Slow down - For those not used to speaking in front of others, we can get nervous and start speeding up our speech without realizing it. Speed can be our number one enemy to incoherent speech. Clear speech or ""diction"" starts with slowing down and making sure you're properly enunciating each word. Now, this doesn't mean slow it to a crawl but make an effort to take your time and get your message out clearly and it can improve greatly. Plenty of vocal exercises for this on Google!
- Clarity/Loudness + Mic Tests - Mumbling can occur without you realizing it. If you're a bit anxious/shy or not used to speaking to an empty room you might be quieter than you realize. It can help to consciously speak a little louder than normal. Now I'm not saying yell into the mic but try and project your voice a little past your monitor rather than just speaking at the mic. Also, for all that is holy please do tests with your mic before your stream. Whenever you stream a new game; test on a recording and adjust levels where need be. First impressions are important and if someone walks into your channel and hears you peaking the mic or can barely hear you, it's very unlikely they'll stay. Also Noise Gates are your friend.

**3. Talking to/Entertaining an Empty Room**

Probably one of the hardest things to start doing as a new streamer. It's a hard concept to grasp as it is a weird feeling talking to no-one and keeping up a monologue. I was lucky enough to have some YouTube Let's Play experience under my belt before starting to stream so I already had that under control. For most though, it's difficult to keep up. Your viewers (or maybe lack thereof) aren't mind readers. Learning to speak what's on your mind is the first step to entertaining an empty room.

Here are some things I recommend to transition into this ""Monologue mindset"".

- Let's Plays - Speaking of Let's Plays, it's a great way to practice talking to yourself and thinking out loud. Without any chat, you're forced to keep the ""conversation"" going and stay entertaining purely by your own drive. It's also a much better way to develop the skill since making a 15-30 minute video is easier than trying to go right out of the gate and speak to an empty room for 3+ hours. Additionally, YouTube is another great source of content to direct your Twitch viewers too in the future!
- Find your strengths - We all have something we're passionate about and can talk about for hours on end. Finding your topical strengths can help keep the ball rolling. Enjoy being very detailed/in-depth about games? Maybe talk about your thought process on strategies and why you're doing X or Y. Or maybe you are really great at telling stories? Find opportunities to go off and tell some stories, whether they're from personal experiences or maybe just an awesome tale! Even writing down some brief topics before your streams can be good practice for some. These can be stickied as notes on your monitor as back ups in case you need something spontaneous to talk about.
- Assume the room is full - Whether you realize it or not, it's likely people come in and out of your stream multiple times. The chances of them staying increase greatly if you're in the middle of talking even if it's just for the simple fact they're curious as to what you have to say. I know when I stop by a channel and I see someone streaming deadpan, with no talking at all; it's very unlikely I'll stick around. That being said, don't burn yourself out by talking non-stop. It's perfectly fine to take small breaks from talking. Also don't be worried if people STOP talking. I've had 30+ viewer streams where the chat slowly grinds to a slow crawl. Many lurkers just want to lurk. It's all good.
- Answer your own questions/The 5 Ws - This helps to engage yourself to speak your mind. Using ""Who? What? When? Where? Why?"" when applicable can get you going much easier as opposed to just thinking of things on the spot. It gives you a focal point to jumpstart a conversation with yourself. Even if you start to go off on some random tangent, it's gotten you going. Feel free to answer yourself, when no one does. For example, I normally ask how my viewers days are going, even if no one replies (which happens often) I'll just reply with how my own day was going and it sometimes leads to going off on some random story about my day. At the end of the day it can keep you talking.
- Stay energized - Eat properly before the stream and make sure to take breaks. Streaming can be quite draining and even more-so when you're the only one to keep that energy up. Trying to stream on an empty stomach or when you're super tired means a lesser quality stream. Everyone handles it differently, but from personal experience I just get really un-talkative when I'm hungry. This point can also relate back to confidence; a more energetic, confident streamer is more likely to hold viewers interest than someone who's not.
- Voice Acting/Emotion - I'm an amateur voice actor. I do it just as a hobby for fandubs, audiobooks/plays, etc. It's greatly improved my speech clarity but also doing auditions and projects helped a lot in being more emotive. It's great for those who find they're a bit deadpan in their VODs (which I urge people to look at after their stream is over so they can critique themselves). It gets you out of your comfort zone a little bit and also exercises your vocal range. I recommend people give it a shot! I frequent website such as [BTVA](http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/) and [Casting Call Club](https://www.castingcall.club/homepage) for auditions. 

**Conclusion**

To re-iterate, none of this stuff will get you viewers instantly, nor does it guarantee stream improvement; at the end of the day streaming isn't for everyone. That being said, these skills are building blocks to entertain your potential/current viewers and are useful outside of streaming for everyday use so hopefully some of you got something out of this.

Feel free to ask any further questions! I'll try and address anything that I didn't include in the main post. Also I have VoDs set up on my channel. You're welcome to look through them to see what my commentary is like. Because I took a long break from streaming a good portion of my streams have little to no viewers/chat so you can see how I handle myself.

56r57v,PSA: Comcast To Start 1TB Data Cap Nov. 1,"For those who may be unaware, Comcast is rolling out to a TON of new regions their 1TB a month data cap. This includes uploading and downloading and this will hit twitch users, especially streamers hard, especially those who stream their online games.

If you use any kind of router, I highly recommend setting up a traffic meter for your own protection so you dont go over the limit, and also as back-up proof in case they say you went over the limit and try to charge you for it. Their traffic monitor is known for being extremely inaccurate so its better to have something on your end.

You can find more info about it [here](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/new-data-caps-provide-another-reason-hate-comcast/) and [here](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/)

**Edit:** For those who may need help on how to setup a traffic monitor/meter, heres a basic rundown on how to do it.

If you have a router there should be an option to set one up within it. Type 192.168.1.1 into your browser and login to your router. Default Username and Password should be ""admin"" and ""password"". If not, there is probably a sticker on the outside of the router itself with that info.

Within, there should be an option somewhere to setup a traffic monitor, and generally on the same page an option to disconnect it from the internet once it reaches an amount of data that you specify. I set mine to 999,900MB, at which point my router will disconnect from the internet until 12:01AM at the beginning of the month. If you hit that limit, and even if you dont, I recommend getting a screen shot of you hitting that cap and that internet being shut off in case comcast decides it wants charge you an overage fee, and so youll have proof that you did not go over that amount and that their traffic metering is not correct. [**Here**](http://www.routerpasswords.com/) is a good site for finding the default password for your router.

**Edit 2:** For those thinking about switching services, chances are there arent gonna be any other viable options. AT&amp;T also has a speed cap that you have to pay more for to get unlimited, plus they are much slower then comcast and not recommended for streaming. I recommend filing a formal complaint with the FCC [**here**](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us) to try and get something done about this. Its extremely unethical to charge extra to those who go over a set limit, but not refund those who dont reach that limit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/56r57v/psa_comcast_to_start_1tb_data_cap_nov_1/,1476090613.0,179,0.97,117,Twitch,TimeRocker

56kpj5,What it was like going from 10 concurrent viewers on average to over 1500.,"So, tonight we had an interesting experience.  Twitch pushed our stream up to the front page.  When people first went to Twitch.tv, they saw our stream.

Normally, our board game streams only get about 8 to 12 concurrent viewers and we have a couple of very active people who watch us.  Tonight, we peaked at over 2800 concurrent viewers, averaged over 1500 the whole night, and even after they stopped promoting us; we still kept 300 to 500 for another hour of our stream.

This was bar none an amazing experience, especially since we love to interact with people on our streams.  We were able to introduce a lot of people to board game streaming, and that was even more exciting.  Lots of comments where people were surprised to see that you can even stream board games on Twitch.

We did get a couple of spammers, and since we aren't big, we don't have a dedicated moderator.  As a result, I had to play moderator a bit, but it wasn't as bad as I would have imagined having over 1500 people watching would have been.  2 of the spammers were porn links and were easily banned.  Another spammer or two kept coming back with different accounts and re-spamming.  After half a dozen bannings or so, they gave up though.  Overall this was a minor interruption rather than something that really was a hassle.

The only real disappointment was that we only grew our followers by about 60 tonight.  With such a large viewership, I was hoping for me.  Though, I got the impression that a lot of our viewers were more interested in the novelty of the experience as appose to this being something they would want to engage with a lot in the future.  But it could also be that we just aren't that good of streamers yet :(  Always hard to say.

Either way, if anyone has any questions about what it was like for us, how we ended up on the Front Page, etc... I am more than happy to help! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/56kpj5/what_it_was_like_going_from_10_concurrent_viewers/,1475986332.0,124,0.9,35,Twitch,forgedbygeeks

I tried doing a search on this sub, and all I found was a suggestion a couple of [months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4qder9/idea_give_free_cheer_bits_to_viewers_who_dont_use/)

The ads are about 30 seconds long. The most bits I've gotten is 100. The usual amount of bits you earn is 5 or 10. Sometimes you can get 25 or even 75 bits.

When twitch tells you that you are out of ads for the day, try again in an hour by refreshing the stream. Or going to another streamer that has bits.

55ejpi,"The charity mentioned during yesterday's Twitchcon keynote (GameChanger) has already generated $130,000 from subscriptions on TwitchPrime.","First post on this sub, but I was just watching @OMGChad's interview this morning with the founder of GameChanger Charity.  GameChanger announced they had been able to raise $130,000 in less than 24 hours thanks to the work of the Twitch community and the introduction of TwitchPrime. Ye Gods! @_@

I didn't pay great attention during the initial announcement but it looks like whenever anyone subscribes to a Twitch channel (Prime or not) Twitch donates $1 to the charity.  To see that many subscriptions in less than 24 hours just blows my mind.  

Does this number surprise anyone else or is this tantamount to me being amazed by something like 'grass grows'?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/55ejpi/the_charity_mentioned_during_yesterdays_twitchcon/,1475347512.0,57,0.94,6,Twitch,DoublePlusGoodGames

54yftx,A Guide to Streaming and Finding Success on Twitch Version 2.0,"Hello everyone! A few months back, I put together a fairly lengthy guide to broadcasting. The original post was well received, but the guide was limited in its initially released form as a basic PDF hosted on dropbox. I've taken the time to update the guide with a major overhaul recreating as a much more functional webpage as well as some minor editing changes. [You can view the updated guide here](http://www.overboredgaming.com/guide.html).

As I pointed out when I first put this guide out, it is lengthy, and definitely not meant to be read straight through from beginning to end. There are a lot of covered topics and they are intended to be tackled as you need them. Also, many of them are geared towards broadcasters first starting out with Twitch. Feel free to share the guide in its complete form and I would appreciate any suggestions you might offer in the comments for revisions in an updated release. I've included links to the major topics the guide covers below. You can also navigate the guide itself fairly easily using the arrow keys or the in-guide table of contents.

Web design, html, and js aren't my forte, so the current release of the guide is somewhat limited. This version is not mobile-friendly and lacks a few quality of life features that I hope to add in the future. I expect upcoming versions to have updates on basic functionality, content revisions, and links to additional in-depth resources on individual topics. If you want to look at the original version of this guide, you can find it through [this subreddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4eyva6/a_guide_to_streaming_and_finding_success_on_twitch/). I hope to archive previous versions of the guide itself in the future for easy access.

54wf9c,Don't add random people to your auto-host.,"#Hey /r/twitch  
  
So this has already started, I've been contacted myself from people I don't know who want to be on my Auto-host list.  
Don't add them.  
  
**You should only add people you've vetted personally.**  
You're presenting them to your community. You're telling your community ""This person is entertaining and provides content I think is good enough for you""  
You can't say that if you don't know the broadcaster.  
  
********  
    
*""But Zcotticus, it's about networking to increase my views""*  

Networking is great. I've touched on it in previous posts on [finding people to stream with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/48udzy/guide_on_finding_people_to_stream_with/) and [Using Twitter to your advantage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/44dvof/twitter_how_to_use_it_for_your_benefit/)  
  
You need to balance things, though. If you focus entirely on networking, then your content, community relations, and all the core stuff will suffer.   
A network is useless if you don't have a community.    
  
**********  
  
*""But Zcotticus, I don't have time to do all that other networking stuff, and auto-host makes it easy""*  
  
Whoa... So you don't have the time to properly build a relationship with and support someone to help them grow, and you expect that to happen for you?  
Hosting is a TINY part of networking and building professional relationships with other broadcasters.  
It's why you'll see broadcasters shout-out some people who host, but just thanks others.  
  
********  
  
Building meaningful connections with other broadcasters is beneficial in both a professional and personal sense. Making friends is great. So take the time to watch other broadcasters, become a part of their community, and make a connection. *Then* add them to your Auto-host.  
  
GLHF

54s5eq,Twitch chat on your desktop! Twitch chat for Rainmeter,"I grew tired of the Twitch chat hiding my beautiful Rainmeter layout so I developed a plugin/skin to show the Twitch chat as a Rainmeter skin. This allows you to put the Twitch chat right on your desktop or even as an overlay over a game. It's mainly made for me to better enjoy Twitch but could also be used for streaming.

Pictures of the skin in action:

**(B1) You need to know moderation too!**

As a broadcaster, you can mod your own chat with ease up to hundreds or even thousands of viewers, depending on the intensity of the game you're streaming of course. And for this reason, you need to learn basic moderation commands too! And nobody better to know what you think deserves a purge, timeout or even a permanent ban.

Even if you don't want to mod your own chat, it's very useful to know for the people you will undoubtedly be modding.

&amp;nbsp;

**(B2) Different kinds of moderators**

In my personal opinion, there are three kinds of moderators you are going to need in the long run of your channel.

* Copmod: This police officer will catch people breaking rules in almost an instant and in general will make your chat a better place to be in.
* Clownmod: This person is not modded to time people out, granted they can. They hype the chat up, they keep the chat activity real and alive and are loved by the community.
* Modbot, or Botmod?: This guy will help you configure your bot, or use its commands at appropriate times. Or he will just set a bot up on his own account and help your channel out that way.

But you're honestly free to just mod people you trust, they make the best ones of them all.

&amp;nbsp;

**(B3) A bot is your best mod, choose wisely**

The best moderator in your channel and your most loyal viewer ever (that doesn't actuall contribute to your viewcount, sorry to disappoint you) is your bot.

I've actually only got experience with the two most popular bots but know for a fact there are a lot more of them out there, all very viable and very customisable with unique features.

But the ones I know of and reasons why you might want them are: [Nightbot
](https://beta.nightbot.tv/) and [Moobot](http://twitch.moobot.tv/)

**Nightbot**: Your moderators will be able to edit and add/delete commands to Nightbot simply by commands through the chat. It has a lot of customiseability 

**Moobot**: Moobot is the other bot we use in channels, Nightbot &amp; Moobot are both cloud based I believed. Moobot is not as editable by mods unless you make them an editor in the dashboard and has a lot of preset settings that can be used, making it very easy to use and configure.

&amp;nbsp;

It really is personal preference and how you want to run it in your channel on which one you should choose between the two. The other bots have functions as a loyalty system where people get points for sitting in your chat that they can use for various rewards. I would recommend doing a lot of research! I might update this space tomorrow with information on the bots.

&amp;nbsp;

**(B4) School your mods properly**

This goes without saying. Let your mods know what their limits are, and what they can and can not permaban for. A good example of this is done by Fairlight Excalibur [this picture](http://image.prntscr.com/image/20a1b6fb32ba4160902354c9614bd983.png) telling them what to permaban for and not. . Make sure to tell your mods to educate themselves as well, that's the entire reason I've started writing this, don't leave them clueless. 

&amp;nbsp;

**(B5) Have a third party place where you can contact all of your mods**

I think I can actually not stress this one enough, have a third party application where just you and your moderators can chat with each other, keep contact and whatnot. Good applications for this would be the Curse app, Discord, Slack, heck even a whatsapp/messenger group would work! 

The reason for this is you can talk to them in privacy or all at once, discuss things about your channel with them. Another thing I sometimes do with other mods is we post all of the permabans we put out in the channel together with the reasoning, just as a sign of transparency and so that the broadcaster can acknowledge it. Big recommendation.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB1) From the moment you're modded, you represent the broadcaster. This is a responsibility.**

Remember, you now represent what the broadcaster deems as a trusted person in his stream, so you always have to act responsibly. Try to use common sense and know your limits, it's best to ignore some arguments instead of going on and it spiraling out of control.


&amp;nbsp;

**(MB2) Baby steps - know your commands!**

[Taking a read through the help center for the commands would be great!](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/2329145-how-to-manage-harassment-in-chat) 
But here are the commands anyway.

**Timeout**

This badboy is going to end up being your most used command of all time. You use this command to time people out for X amount of settings. The actual syntax for this command is:

/timeout username_here seconds reason

Usage: /timeout rude 10 Don't be so rude!
&gt;  rude has been timed out for 10s with reason: Don't be so rude!

We will come back as to the proper usage of this command later on.

&amp;nbsp;

**Ban**

Pretty straight forward. This will permanently ban someone from the **chat**. this means they can still watch the stream. 

Usage: /ban racist
&gt;  racist has been banned.

&amp;nbsp;

**Unban**

Also as straightforward as they get. This is not only for permanent bans, it will also unban people that are still on a timeout (I mean, a ban is a permanent timeout right?)

Usage: /unban mistake
&gt;   mistake is no longer banned from this room.

&amp;nbsp;

**Chat modes**

The chat can be put into multiple modes, limiting what the chatters can do. This will be discussed later on for proper usage. But the commands are:

&amp;nbsp;

*Subscribers-only mode*

Usage: /subscribers
&gt; This room is now in subscribers-only mode.

Turning it off: /subscribersoff
&gt;  This room is no longer in subscribers-only mode.

&amp;nbsp;

*R9K*

Usage: /r9kbeta
&gt;  This room is now in r9k mode.

Turning it off: /r9kbetaoff
&gt;  This room is no longer in r9k mode.

&amp;nbsp;

*Slowmode*

Usage: /slow 67
&gt;  This room is now in slow mode. You may send messages every 67 seconds.

Turning it off: /slowoff
&gt;  This room is no longer in slow mode.

&amp;nbsp;

*Emote-only mode*

Usage: /emoteonly
&gt;  This room is now in emote-only mode.

Turning it off: /emoteonlyoff (have you noticed a pattern yet [](#Kappa) )
&gt;  This room is no longer in emote-only mode.

&amp;nbsp;

That pretty much covers the vanilla commands I believe. BetterTwitchTV &amp; FrankerFaceZ (Amazing add-ons, covered later on) add extra commands like /purge (1 second timeout) and /massunban (unbans all permanently banned people, NOT the timed out people).

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB3) Baby steps part 2 - know the bot commands!**

This is a simple one, most channels have bots with custom commands that the broadcaster has set. He has them set for a reason most likely, so get to know these commands and use them in chat whenever appropriate. Later on I will tell you about adding or deleting commands from the bots so you save the broadcaster some hassle. 

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB4) Talk to the broadcaster**

Make sure that you know not only your limits, but what the broadcaster expects off of you. This way you can get a clear vision of what's going and just be comfortable in the chat. 

A wonderful example of talking to a broadcaster and the broadcaster laying down the law as in what he expects to be permabanned or not is done by Fairlight_Excalibur to his mods [in this picture.](http://image.prntscr.com/image/20a1b6fb32ba4160902354c9614bd983.png)

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB5) The default timeout is mostly NOT what you want to use!**

You've probably already turned on the default mod icons (that's right, you can change them, explained in advanced moderating) and noticed that they are a 10 minute timeout and a permaban. If you have not actually activated them yet, there's an option for them as well as an option for seeing the actions of other moderators, both incredibly useful ofcourse.

But that doesn't mean it's the right choice, I mean, isn't it a bit harsh giving someone a 10 minute timeout because they left their caps lock on by accident? This is why you should mostly be working with a purge of 0 seconds, ranging up to 10 seconds.

If you already have BetterTTV or FrankerFaceZ installed, you can do all of this in the moderation card when you click on somebodies name. This will be discussed a bit later on though.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB6) Be considerate, there's another human on the other side, even if it doesn't seem so**

Continuing from the last point of not using default timeouts, even if the user breaks rules, be it not so accidentally anymore. Does that mean we permanently ban them from ever talking in the chatroom again? Personally, I never will unless the broadcaster tells me too or the user is breaking TOS / being incredibly malicious.

People have bad days, they let other people on their accounts (BAD DON'T DO THIS), sometimes their dog is typing and the next day it's their ostrich typing. You honestly would be surprised with some excuses people have come up with to get out of their timeouts, albeit some of them are true.

Be considerate, but still take action. This is more of a subjective point so take it as you will.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB7) There can be more to modding than just timing people out**

This is in my opinion one of the more important notes. You don't just have to be a cop in the chat, be friends with them, interact.

Keep the chat activity alive as much as you can, this is helping the broadcast immensely if done right and I can guarrantee you that they will appreciate it. There's multiple ways to achieve this I've found from personal experience.

There are people who are not a fan of this, but when someone says Hello in the chat, an appropriate response would be to talk back right? Do so! Say hi to everybody that greets you all. It promotes a healthy and friendly atmosphere in the chat. **But let me stress this, never call out lurkers, even if they're a staff member, admin or global mod. They're probably lurking for a reason**.

&amp;nbsp; 

**(MB8) If the unfortunate situation ever arises your broadcaster is breaking rules, tell them.**

Pretty straight forward. Sometimes the broadcaster doesn't realise he's breaking rules, or he has songrequest on and there's a seemingly innocent song in the qeue, but it may be one of those cheeky ones with 150 views containing racist words and whatnot in the middle of the song. You can prevent that, granted it's some effort to go through every songrequest. Or maybe your broadcaster decided to play a game that is actually banned on Twitch, but is not technically that bad of a game (I'll bring up the Yandere game drama here).

&amp;nbsp;

**(MB9) Browser add-ons can make your life super easy**

Let me show some quick examples of moderation cards when you click on somebodies name: [FrankerFaceZ](http://image.prntscr.com/image/47ed63e82220463b9b4ebaa71180dd3b.png) &amp; [BetterTwitchTV](http://image.prntscr.com/image/9a3e072b48de4a3cb33c0fb4b8616a77.png).

This alone, makes it so much easier to mod, granted some people don't actually like using add-ons as they may add clutter and whatnot to the chat.

Honestly though, they add SO many functions to Twitch in general, not just to modding (even GIF emotes yo!). I would definitely recommend checking them out and using them if you prefer.

Side note though! It IS possibly to use BOTH FrankerFaceZ and BetterTTV at the same time - But BetterTTV will override some of FrankerFaceZ settings so that you will not be able to use them.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA1) Help the broadcaster with managing relations in his community**

This is pretty much community management, so you take some work off of your broadcaster's shoulders (technically he/she should be doing this). You're starting to work on the relations with certain loyal viewers, subscribers, people of importance (Game devs, PR agents).

Doing events with the community **off-stream** is a super important factor. This is boasting the relations outside of the stream as well, bonding you might say. Things you could do can consist of Movienights, tabletop games, card games or just generally voicechatting / text chatting with each other.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA2) Know when to activate the certain chat modes**

I'll start off by saying I don't have much experience myself with this, the most I've really had to do is put chat in slowmode or subscribers mode whenever the broadcaster asked for it. I have however seen very creative use of these modes.

As a quick reminder, there are 4 different modes you can put the chat in:

* R9k = Only unique messages are allowed. It checks for a minimum of 9 characters I believe, a very effective way of simply getting rid of copypasta.
* Slowmode = You set a slowmode with a delay of however much you would like, this means they can only post messages X seconds after each other, not that their message will show up later.
* Subscriber mode = Pretty self explanatory right? Only subs, mods, admins and twitch staff can chat. (even if they are nonsubs)
* Emote only mode = Now this one I like. I believe the original use for this was to not get spoilers during a playthrough, but it gets rid of chat apart from emotes so I don't think it really worked out that way. However I have seen creative use of this chat mode, there's a speedrunner I watch that can't really look at chat during a part of the run, so he lets his chat go nuts. After he's done with that part, a mod puts it in emote-only mode to let everybody cool off for a bit, and then removes it and they continue.

That in my opinion is proper usage of modes without the broadcaster enabling / specifying it to be enabled. It could also be used to just have fun with the chat, but be sure to have the broadcaster's permission to do so, or just wing it! Be creative!

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA3) When a loyal community member crosses the line, handle it properly**

This is again, a more subjective topic on how you should deal with it. 

As you know people can change overtime, they might be dealing with severe depression that nobody knows anything about and one day they hit breaking point and start bringing it up in chat and lowering the mood of everybody. Dealing with this is a very serious issue, not just for depression of course, some people just turn into dickheads after a certain amount of time.

It's best to treat these privately I've found, they've been a community member for X amount of time, they should know better or get help from friends right? Start whispering them with perhaps a purge to get rid of their message. Help them out.

I should probably repeat, this is mostly a very personal matter with a drastic change of events, treat it discretely.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA4) Configure your Twitch add-ons properly / to your liking.**

This is more of a personal thing where I will not go into too much detail, but to describe my setup: I use FrankerFaceZ with the *BTTV emotes for FrankerFaceZ* add-on. The reason for this is I prefer using FrankerFaceZ for modding and chatting purposes and it has less bugs with Twitch when it updates (it's more vanilla so to say).

My biggest reason for using FrankerFaceZ is right here: http://prnt.sc/ckrkb3
Custom mod icons! (That is a 10 second purge, so that I can follow up with a modcard action afterwards :P)

**(MA5) Learn to add / delete commands from the bot in the chat**

This one is going to require some extensive research and googling for adding commands. It differs per bot. I can however tell you that for Moobot this is not incredibly difficult and is done via a dashboard that has a lot of presets. But in order for a mod to be able to do this, the broadcaster has to make you an editor of their Moobot dashboard first.

For Nightbot however this is incredibly easy. Let's say we wanted to add a command to say I like bananas, it would be: !addcom !banana Growlibi likes bananas.
Pretty simple right? And then changing it would go something like: !editcom !banana Growlibi hates bananas. Or !delcom !banana to completely delete it.

This can be super in-depth like adding a !followage command. That would look a little like: !addcom !followage $(touser) has been following USERNAME_HERE for [$(customapi https://apis.rtainc.co/twitchbot/following?channel=USERNAME_HERE&amp;user=$(touser))]

Yeah, definitely time to hit up the googles.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA6) If necessary, add blacklisted words / lines (like after a GoT finale or something)**

I don't think I really have to explain this one in detail. The broadcaster can filter out words himself, or you as a mod can do this with a bot. I would definitely do this for most racist / sexual insulting slurs and perhaps the occassional spoiler so that the bot will instantly get them.

**(MA7) Having knowledge of the content being streamed is a big plus**

This is more of a thing of being able to contribute to chat, and being a very positive atmosphere. In the bigger streams a lot of people who are brand new to Twitch often jump in the stream with questions, not only about the game but also about Twitch. Being able to help them will give them an amazing first impression and so they should, twitch is absolutely amazing.

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA8) Set up chat logs**

Alright, this one is a bit more intricate. I have a friend who made a logger that I can add to channels and it starts logging every chat line as usual of course.

The cool thing about his logger is that I can whisper it with a private command and it will show me the last 3 lines of the user in question as well as a link to everything they've said since logging. This is REALLY useful for dealing with past timeouts/permabans to see if it's worthy of unbanning or not.

I would *highly* recommend everyone to set up a logger in their broadcaster's channel if they allow it, I don't really have any recommendations for one though, since I don't know if I'm allowed to spread this to the publics like I am.

*EDIT: Cbenni allows anyone to use his logviewer which you can find at https://cbenni.com/ . After checking it out it's a pretty sweet and detailed tool that should definitely be made use of. Keep in mind though the broadcaster needs to enable this.*

*EDIT2: Another logger suggested by Moblord and developed by Capncase. Does logging and triggers things like.. notifies Slack of bans (with last lines they wrote), new sub notifications, giveaway auto-log, donations auto-log, highlight w/ timestamp command autolog, etc. more proactively pushes things to slack, rather than just being a static log. see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch2slack*

&amp;nbsp;

**(MA9) Make use of new functions!**

Yes! Twitch is adding a ton of absolutely amazing functions for mods that we've been asking for for AGES! Which is absolutely a joy. We now have automatic mod logs, so that if someone goes rogue they can instantly be snitched out. 

We also have artificial chat delay now (enabled by the broadcaster under https://www.twitch.tv/settings/channel thanks to /u/enslaver), so that we can timeout messages before the public even sees them! And the best thing of them all.....CHAT RULES! People can no longer use the excuse that they missed the rules, because it is impossible now!

&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp;

**That's about it. you are now a god amongst moderators, in knowledge. Be sure to spread the word around and educate people on topics, spread the love &lt;3**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**(LAZY / TLDR) The to-go modding manual**

As a new mod, you will want to enable the mod icons in chat (bottom left cog), but if someone crosses the line **purge them instead** (in mod card if you have BTTV / FrankerFaceZ browser add-ons **(get them, they're SO useful)** when you click on their name) or type out /timeout username 0. This is a lot more friendly than timing someone out for 10 entire minutes. Be considerate with your powers, there's another person on that side of the screen!

Your other commands are: /ban, /unban, /subscribers (submode), /subscribersoff, /slow seconds, /slowoff, /r9kbeta, /r9kbetaoff, /emoteonly, /emoteonlyoff.

Definitely **have a talk with the streamer** on what he expects of you, he chose to mod you after all. Know what you can and can not permaban in his chat. Know the Twitch TOS and Rules of Conduct too! 

Be a friendly atmosphere in the chat, **you now represent the broadcaster AND their community** for anyone new joining the stream. Make sure to greet people (but do not disturb lurkers!). Don't be intimidating, let the plebs reign free sometimes when they go on a small spam spree ([](#Kappa) check?).

People will whisper you for help, for unbans. So you have to deal with this too. Do what you think is best, if unsure &gt; contact the broadcaster / fellow mods.

Be on a third party chatroom with the rest of the mods and broadcaster (this is on the streamers!).

Knowledge knowledge knowledge, can't stress this enough. Know about the streamer, their schedule, rules, their game, about twitch. 

**SET UP TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ON YOUR ACCOUNT.** It can be catastrophic for a streamer if one of their mods get hijacked and they start timing people out for the maximum duration so that everyone would have to go through them manually.

They never received any contact from the Ticket Fairy. I received my badge in the mail a few weeks ago...but not their badges.


The cocnerning thing is that on the Ticket Fairy ticket page it says that I am ""Valid"" and they are all ""Unpaid"". I verified on my credit card statement that I paid for all 4 tickets in full.


Now, one would assume their badges will be at will-call...but I cant verify this and dont want to run into any snafus when arriving and them claiming they should have their badges or something.


I have contacted The Ticket Fairy support 4 times, direct messaged them on facebook, commented on their page in facebook, and even resorted to Twitch itself BEGGING them to put me in contact with their partner for ticket sales. I have had ZERO response.


At this point I'm very frustrated and not sure what to do other than just go to TwitchCon and pray they dont fuck this up for my friends who are coming in from out of town.





Sincerely,
A very frustrated customer with a very simple question



**Edit:** I have heard back from TTF customer support saying theyre looking into it now...lets see what happens. Im feeling good that Ive at least made contact!

**https://blog.twitch.tv/new-chat-moderation-tools-get-hype-59f89a06f13d**

* Moderation Action Attribution: See what mods are doing what. A great way to see if you have a rogue mod in your mix or to converse with other mods via whispers if you have a difference in opinion over a chat rule. This should improve the quality of chat moderation overall!
* Chat Rules: Require new viewers to your channel to agree to chat rules which you can set in your settings page!
* Chat Delay: If you want to keep your chat clean, then giving your mods a few seconds head start is the ideal way to accomplish this. With this feature, only the moderators of the channel will see &lt;message deleted&gt; if you get to it in time, all other viewers won't even know it was there! Yay! Now your chat looks clean and isn't full of &lt;message deleted&gt;!

Many places don't even show the loginname anymore, so it's hard to identify people by name and instead I need to memorize how their name kinda looks.

Also their names are sticking out in chat by being extra long, although I personally already disabled their foreign names via FFZ (which doesn't work for whispers). Almost everyone I asked said they were not aware that it was a permanent change (as the warning apparently doesn't show up on the english ui, and the people temporarily changing to japanese to abuse it certainly can't read it).

51q8y5,Indepth guide on how to properly configure your stream to give your viewers the best experience,"This will be a long post so I won't do a long intro. 

This is what I learned and believe to be true after some indepth research on Twitch stream settings. At the start I did it for a friend who started to stream some Overwatch but this can be helpful for any streamer, specially FPS streamer.

I only talk about OBS but the logic is the same for Xsplit and other streaming tools.

This is some kind of repost since at least one thread like that is posted every year or two.

# OBS settings Part 1 : How to chose your Resolution, Fps and Bitrates

***
***

The most important indicator of the quality of a stream and mostly unknow is the Quality Factor (QF) wich can be a percentage or expressed in bits per pixel. Let's take an example to explain what is the QF:

Your game is in 1920 * 1080 (1080p) and you are streaming in 1280 * 720 (720p) in 30 FPS. Your bitrate is set to 2.000 kbps or 2.000.000 bps.

Quality Factor = Bitrate  / ( Horizontal Resolution * Vertical Resolution * FPS )

Quality Factor = 2.000.000 / (1280 * 720 * 30 ) = 0,072 bit-per-pixel or 7.23%

We all saw the stream of someone going blurry during high action phase, pixels form some kind of masses and the result can be pretty ugly. You NEED to have a QF of, at least, 10% if you want your stream to be flawless and not having this kind of trouble.

To make your life easier here are some settings with a 10% QF.

Resolution | Fps | Bitrate
:--:|:--:|:--:
1280 * 720 | 22 | 2000
**1280** * **720** | **27** | **2500**
**1280** * **720** | **30** | **2764**
**1280** * **720** | **33** | **3000**
**1280** * **720** | **38** | **3500**
**1096** * **616** | **30** | **2000**
1096 * 616 | 37 | 2500
1096 * 616 | 44 | 3000
1096 * 616 | 52 | 3500

In bold you got the settings I higlhy recommand using, the other are also ok if you prefer high fps. 720p with 22 Fps is shit.

I highly encourage you to do the math yourselves and remember, 10% is the minimum for a good fidelity but its' ok to have only 5% 6% if you have no choice.

# OBS settings Part 2 : Encoding, Video and Advanced

***
***

### Encoding 

***

You have 2 choices here: x264 or Nvenc (never did some research on Quick Sync so I won't talk about it). The best for Twitch and low birates (3500kbps and under is very low in the absolute) is x264 by far. Nvenc start to shine with very high bitrates and is good for local recording.

x264 will use your CPU a lot more than Nvenc and can cause some ingame trouble for the lowest computer. What you have to do is testing, check if your CPU can handle x264 in veryfast or ultrafast preset (I will explain where to find those settings later), if not go Nvenc.

Use CBR (Constant Bitrate) and enable CBR padding

Max Bitrate: well you know what you have to put her if you did check above

### Video

*** 

Resolution downscale: this is the output resolution, the one your viewer will receive so check above and find wich one fit you

Filter: Lanczos is better than Bicubic wich is better than Bilinear in theory. It seems they were a lot of bugs with Lanczos. The filter use your GPU not your CPU, it wont change a lot of things but having a better stream at this point is all about the addition of little tweaks like this.

### Advanced

***

## General

Be sure to have Use Multithreaded Optimizations enabled.

The Process Priority Class can be changed up to High and it can solve some lag or freeze problem ingame. For example if you chose to use Nvenc instead of x264 because you had some little freeze ingame put this on High and check x264 again. Putting your game processus priority on Above Normal on the Windows Manager can help aswell. Or everything can completly back fire and cause more lags.

## Video

x264 CPU preset: this one is huge and very simple to understand, ultrafast will use your CPU way less but the render quality will decrease aswell. Slower hit your CPU hard but give you a better render. Veryfast and Medium are the recommanded one, the difference in CPU usage after Medium is huge so if your PC can handle Medium chose it but you don't need to go higher.

Encoding Profile : main is Twitch recommanded one and you wanna use it

Keyframe Interval: 2

Enable Use CFR

It is possible that I made some mistakes so be sure to tell me where. It also possible that you are not agree with a specific point, just say it and why perhaps you are completly right and you can help me understand how all of this work better.

I apologize for my approximate english and I really, really hope this will help you.

51ep25,Types of Twitch Viewers,"After 3 years streaming on Twitch, and being a small broadcaster with a solid base of regulars I love, I feel like I, along with a lot of you, have experienced a plethora of personalities and differing viewer archetypes while streaming.

Below is a SATIRICAL list of the types of viewers I come across on the regular.

Feel free to add to this is if I am missing something.

**The Die Hard:** This person is the bread and butter of any small streamer. You probably met them while you were doing your second stream ever with your horrible upload speed. They were your first mod, and the first person that had a positive effect on you as a streamer. They will message you back and forth at ridiculous times of the night and are the reason you keep going on the slow days.

**The group guy:**  It never fails. They have you on steam. They follow you on Origin, and every time you start up the stream they want to play with you. ""Hey man wanna play"" is usually followed by 8 other messages with the same wording spammed to your inbox even though you are playing a single player game with no multiplayer.

**The Emotional one:** It never fails. 20 minutes into the stream and this viewers is claiming their cat died and their older brother is an Alien from outer space. Everything has to be about them. They will suck the life out of even the most positive streamer. They can bring the chat down very quickly and make streaming seem like a mini therapy session some days.

**The Voice Chat guy:** This guy couldn't be bothered to put in the work it takes to start a stream and make it grow. Instead he always seems to be lurking in the ""group chat"" channel in your discord. SERIOUSLY he's always there....waiting..watching....and messaging you to 
""jump in voice chat"" cause he's gotta tell you something. Every time, your stream is seen as an opportunity to try out this ""sweet one liner"" he read on 4Chan the night before. He thinks he has the voice of a golden god, but really hes just a 13 year old trying to be edgy.

**The Chat Champion:** This person deserves a gold belt. They show up almost every stream and add to your game play and commentary. They ACTUALLY WATCH the game play and are invested in everything you are doing. When a new person joins chat they are nice, welcoming, and a positive reflection of the community you are trying to build. If you have a Chat Champion make sure you treat them well. This person may be one of your first mods ever.

**The Fighter:** NO ONE PUTS THIS BABY IN THE CORNER! They get offended by everything, and usually show up to watch in between tiny bouts of anger and rage just because you said you hated politics last stream. When ""The Fighter"" and ""The Emotional One"" show up on the same day, its going to get interesting.

**The Troll:** Even though you may not have the patience for them today they are there. They show up every stream and are one of your biggest supporters, but they can also cause you problems. They want CX's in a chat full of 6 people, and if you have song requests on get ready for the latest ""Meme Wave"" to hit your play list. They can usually be calmed down though with a heavy dose of H3H3 memes and herambe talk. 

**The game choice guy:** ""BRO WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THIS GAME INSTEAD!"" Oh you thought it would be good to play a full week of a certain game? Well this guy will love you for those 5 days, and then he will infect your channel for a week after. He wants you to play Barbie's magic castle like last week and HE WANTS IT NOW! He is a master of ""all caps"" in chat, and his Kappa game is strong. He will also be gone, never to be seen again eventually, so don't stress too much about them.

**The Mouth:** OH MAN what the hell was that play? Seriously don't make mistakes in game around this guy. He keeps you motivated to get better, but also loves a good jab at his favorite streamer. Every mistake you make is meticulously recorded by his terminator like memory. He will remind you every day for a week about that easy penta kill you missed last week. He will make fun of you a bit...but its all out of love.

**The Back Seater:** Ever heard of stream delay? Well this guys sure as hell hasn't. He is trying to guide you to a pin hole sized Easter egg in Dark Souls, and you are currently running a minute and a half delay. They want you to find every little thing they found during their 8th play through, but on your first one! They will put up walls of text into chat that are copy and pasted from the wiki. They will not accept defeat, and they come from a good place. They want to help, and they show it by being your ""player 2"". If they could they would probably jump through the screen and ring your neck for missing that secret door 5 minutes ago though.

**The Lurker:** Always there...but never speaks. He quietly judges you from his computer and says hello when you start but that's about it. They are masters at telepathically mocking your mistakes, and randomly donating 5 dollars once a year.

**The Rich Kid:** Always enters chat like hes walking into a club with a fist full of 5 dollars bills. Will you put a shoe on your head for a 20? If so he might oblige with a donation from daddy's credit card. He has a car and hes 13, and he doesn't waste time talking...he puts his money where his moth is. Turn on text to speech donations and watch the money roll in in small increments of 2 dollars or less.

**Charles Chargeback:** He talks like fire....but this guy is all smoke. He starts out as any streamers wish come true. A 100 dollar donation!!!! They make you scream with excitement, jump with joy, and then cry in a deep pit of depression and sadness two days later when they charge back and refund their donation. SERIOUSLY FUCK this guy!

**The Specs guy:** Are you playing an amazing game with a breathtaking story and awesome character models? This guys doesn't fucking care bro! Put it on Ultra high or GTFO is his moto. He doesn't have time for small talk. He just wants to know if his dick is....ermm....I mean..if his graphics card is better then yours. Just put your specs in the Info panels and he wont bug you anymore.

**The Shitposter:** ""Golden Kappa test""

That's all I can think of right now.

Id like to point out that I would be happy with almost any of these people viewing my channel. People all have their own intricacy's and differences. This is straight satire with a bit of truth peppered in ;)

Feel free to add to it if you think I have missed anything!

50zylm,Uploads coming soon to Twitch!,"I'm posting this because so far as I can tell, it is all public knowledge. If there is anything inappropriate though, Mods can feel free to delete it.

During TwitchCon 2015 there was an [official Tweet](https://twitter.com/twitchcon/status/647466617908006912) about ""Uploads"" coming soon to Twitch. The feature would make it possible for us to edit our own footage off-site and upload it directly to the site. I was really excited for this feature as a Partner, because I've always wanted to use Twitch for all of my video content, but we didn't hear anything more about the feature for over a year.

Then yesterday, during a segment announcing [Moderation Logs and Discovery](https://www.twitch.tv/pax3/v/87164912?t=01h55m51s) at PAX, we were given a glimpse of [something interesting on a profile screen](http://i64.tinypic.com/5zqolx.jpg). Sandwiched between ""Highlights"" and ""Following"" was a new tab: ""Uploads""!

I wouldn't be surprised if Twitch is holding out to tell us more about this at TwitchCon 2016 later in the month. The timing is absolutely perfect for such a feature. YouTube announced only a few days ago that they would be rolling out a new, ""ad-friendly"" content policy that prevents videos with foul language from being monetized.

50lyr6,1month+ of harassment and 40+ accounts have been made. What else can I do to stop this?!,"I have been harassed by another twitch user for a little over a month now. He has made 40+ twitch accounts (just from the ones I checked in messages) to insult or embarrass me. I'm not quite sure what to do with the situation anymore. I feel I have taken the appropriate measures in order to avoid anymore drama from said individual. From changing my settings so only verified emails are able to type in my chat when I stream, to setting it so users I am not following are no longer able to message/whispers me. Unfortunately this has not been enough. I just got done streaming where 5+ accounts were made again. I have reported every account he has made, most have gotten banned, but quite a few have not. Reporting doesn't really seem to stop him from making more accounts anyways. Over 40 were made (just from checking my messages alone I was able to give that number).  
  
I feel this has gotten to a ridiculous point and this person will not stop. I figured wait a month, and he should move on with something else, however that has not been the case.  
  

Is there anything I can do that I may of missed to prevent further harassment from this person?


EDIT: Just an update. Its been 5 days since I've posted this. Also 5 days since I've put in a few tickets to twitch support. It doesn't seem like anything is going to be done about this situation.

I'm quite overwhelmed recently as I have become more popular (nothing huge but still more than I was use to) and with this has come a lot of peoples influence into my stream. I honestly love all the help they have offered but at the same time I'm starting to feel like a child being told what to do by their parents. I don't want to offend any of my viewers but at the same time I feel like my channel has become less about me playing games and interacting through chat with my followers and more about them telling me to do things. Some of the things they tell me to do are go into discord and talk to them, (I'm not a huge fan of this because I become overwhelmed having so many people talking at once) them telling saying that I never play follower games when I do every day, them telling me when to and not to stream. I feel lost because I don't want to lose any followers by being too firm but at the same time I feel like i'm losing my dignity by being pushed over consistently. There was even an instance of one of my viewers saying he was going to kill himself because I told him that he was too low to play a ranked game with me.

4zptvb,Streaming is not just about streaming,"**TL;DR: Love your community and give them the best you have, because this is what they deserve. I’m a sentimental sissy.**


One day, a colleague at work told me: You would be really good at streaming. My ego said: Fuck yeah, let’s start streaming. It can be a hobby and also bring some money to the table, playing videogames isn’t that hard, right?


Well, schnitzel. That’s not how it works.


In case you guys did not read the thousands of posts talking about streaming on r/twitch, well, it’s hard. I’d say it’s about 20 times harder than what I thought it would be. When you are a control freak like me, you want to work on everything: Visuals, social medias, overlay, CSS code, hardware, bots, etc. And that’s just the shell, this doesn’t make you entertaining and that’s not a guarantee that people will come back to see you. You slowly become more consistent, more serious about it, you build a schedule, and you have to make it coexist with your life outside of Twitch (Yeah, good luck with that).


And then you meet these wonderful people, the coo-coos that thought: “Yo, this channel has one viewer, let’s go check it out and say hi!” If you are good enough, they’ll stick around. 5 becomes 20, and then 40, and so on… Some just lurk and enjoy your show and that’s already awesome, but if you are lucky, some are going to be a lot more than just viewers.


Well, that’s what happened to me.


No magic trick, no recipe to success, just a handful of fantastic people that decided that you were worth their time. For them, I try to be the best person I can be and I do my absolute best to improve. I made room in my life to give that extra mile, because they made room in their lives for me. 


That means that I will support them in their own channel, bigger or smaller. I spend hours working on my own channel, doing researches, watching my own VOD and see what I could improve for next stream. I will stay longer on Discord just to hang out with them and have a blast. Streaming is no longer about just going live. It’s about doing the extra mile for people that believe in you.


**A word directly to these amazing people:**

There is not a single day I regret sacrificing so much for the channel.
There are days I don’t want to stream, it happens a lot more often than you think, may it be after a rough day at work, or I’m just not feeling all that bubbly and shit. But I will turn on the webcam anyway, because I know that 5 minutes in, you guys will make it all go away, because we are all here to have fun and share something special together. 


Even when I had a bad day, if one of you guys tell me you had a rough day and could use some chuckles, I will go live with no second thoughts and give you the best of me. This is my best motivation to give a good show, because if all this time and effort gives you the tiniest moment of happiness, it makes it all worth it.
Even to this day, after sometimes hundreds and hundreds of hours spent with me, I still feel unworthy of your love, because there are thousands or people just like me that are trying to make it on Twitch, but you chose me, and living up to this gift is my primary goal. Not money, not fame, I just want to brighten your day as much as you brighten mine. 


I just want to let you know that I am happy you guys are putting up with my shit, whether I’m burning a meal in the kitchen, failing miserably at making perlers, raging at a game that is “too hard” or playing a really old stupid game and ruin your childhood.

Thank you for being part of my life, for making it that much more special. I’m corny, I embrace it. I love you guys.

4zkj6i,Guide to handling a compromised moderator.,"Is a person mysteriously and repeatedly reappearing after being banned or timed out in your chat? Is your chat being filled by timeout commands seemingly out of nowhere? Is one of your moderators spouting out-of-nature racism and pornographic links? Chances are your channel has a compromised moderator.

Solving this issue is bothersome, but relatively simple:

1. Unmod all your moderators. To get a list of all your moderators, simply type the ""/mods"" command. Additionally, you can use [this handy tool](https://twitchstuff.3v.fi/unmod.html) to unmod all of them at once. This will immediately stop any on-going attack, but will also temporarily disable your moderation.

2. Secure your account by resetting your password. This will log out all other active sessions, reset your OAuth token, and reset your stream key. Unless they have changed the email your account is connected to or compromised your email account, this will make your account secure again. If you cannot do this or if it doesn't work you'll want to contact [support](http://link.twitch.tv/help), which may take a bit longer.

3. Re-add your moderators one by one once they've secured their own account using the above step. If you find your chat is under attack again after adding one moderator, unmod them to see if it stops. If it does, you've pinpointed the problem. Popular moderation bots are generally held to a higher standard of security by their owners, and as such can generally (but not always!) be re-added immediately.

In addition, here's a few steps you can take to minimize the risk in the future:

1. Regularly clean your moderator list. Has a moderator been inactive for months? Do you have a bunch of honorary mods? Did you mod your best friend a few months ago? Unmod them. Every additional moderator is an added risk for your channel, so keep them to a minimum.

2. Enforce use of 2FA among your moderators. While it doesn't make it impossible for a malicious user to compromise an account, it makes it a hell of a lot harder. Seriously. Use 2FA.

3. Keep an eye on what apps you've authorized on your and your moderators Twitch accounts. You can see which apps have been authorized by scrolling down on [this page](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections), and disconnect them with a single click.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4zkj6i/guide_to_handling_a_compromised_moderator/,1472155245.0,67,0.95,20,Twitch,Kanthes
4zdww3,My Time Being a Single Game Broadcaster,"Hello everyone! For your potential benefit, I would like to share a bit about my past experience as a single-game streamer. As far as broadcasts go, the show I’m a part of is about as pure variety broadcasting as you can get. /u/Brawli55 and I put on a two-man cast, and it is hard enough to come up with game choices we are both happy with on a daily basis, let alone finding one that we would both be fine streaming for weeks or months at a time. However, when my schedule permitted it in the past, I held regular off-hour broadcasts on my own.

In 2014, this led to a four-month period where I became one of the larger Pokemon X/Y broadcasters on Twitch. The show was never the size of Justin Flynn’s broadcast in its heyday, but I did average 300-500 concurrent viewers every afternoon with some peaks into the 700-900 viewer range during that time. Ultimately, I stopped playing the game and moved on. While the experience is long in the past, I definitely learned more about Twitch from the time. Condensing things down leaves a lot out, but even then this post is pretty long winded and I understand that the length is not for everyone. Still, if you’re looking to hear about a Twitch experience slightly outside of the normal fare, I hope you enjoy and find it useful.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


**The Story**

In December of 2013, I decided I wanted a 3DS, specifically to play Fire Emblem: Awakening. Much of my gaming time is spent on broadcast, so I figured that a capture-card-modded 3DS was in order. It was the only way to broadcast games on the 3DS, and added several hundred dollars onto the cost of the system itself: not a trivial investment. A couple months later, a family member gave me a copy of Pokemon Y. I had just finished a run of XCOM during an afternoon broadcast, and wasn’t sure what to play next. Several moderators in our channel had suggested that I get around to playing Pokemon at some point, and fond childhood memories of a series I hadn’t played in 13 years made me say, “sure, why the hell not.”

I started off with a casual run of the game, playing through the story and having some general fun with it. I saw some reasonable numbers, slightly larger than what I had with XCOM, but nothing very impressive. I was taking my time, savoring the game, and had no general plans or ambition. However, about halfway into my playthrough, my viewership grew. In a sea of people that had played Pokemon over the years, and streamers who had built their cast around competitive play, I was an idiot. I knew nothing. I didn’t remember Pokemon types, names, anything. I had no knowledge of the competitive scene. All I had was a naive enjoyment of the game that was apparently refreshing to watch.

Eventually, my afternoon numbers grew to the average size of our evening broadcast. To add to this, I was streaming at a convenient time of day. My broadcast continued on after several large morning Pokemon streams ended. One of those broadcasters was particularly good-natured and had a habit of raiding smaller Pokemon streamers. Brawli and I actually were aware of him before he became an exclusively Pokemon broadcaster and he was one of the many broadcasters we followed on Twitter, regularly retweeted, and occasionally replied to. There was no real effort there beyond some casual networking and friendly retweeting, but the name of our channel stood out and he took a chance on it.

The result was a huge one-time spike in viewership that brought with it an awareness that people might really be interested in watching me enjoy Pokemon. Of course, you can only continue a story-driven playthrough of a game for so long, so as I finished, I realized that if I was interested in continuing on, I would need to branch into viewer battles and semi-competitive play. I knew nothing. I was a neophyte in a world of experienced players. So, I decided to learn.

I borrowed a few competitively-raised Pokemon from mods who were more than willing to help. I started playing against viewers. I planned a team of viable Pokemon and began the process of breeding, leveling, and equipping them, all on stream. I was terrible. I knew nothing, had to ask my audience frequent questions and look up information/guides mid-stream. There were hours of riding back and forth in game to hatch eggs. Constant misunderstandings and mistakes. The entire thing was a mess.

And viewers loved all of this. People enjoyed imparting knowledge. There are few things people like more than when someone is genuinely interested in what they love and they have a chance to help spread that love. When I did viewer battles, my focus wasn’t on winning, because I started out losing significantly more than I won, but rather on having fun and making sure everyone involved had fun. As I calmly and patiently learned, others had the chance to learn with me.

That process continued on for weeks. Eventually, I stopped being a neophyte and started winning much more than I was losing. But I never stopped making fun the main focus of the broadcast. I was soft-spoken, calm, and constantly emphasized that the whole point of the game was to have a good time. In a sea of cutthroat game play, our channel was an island where people could compete without worrying about being looked down on for their choices and failings. Making mistakes was something everyone did. We made sure to help people learn from their mistakes rather than put them down because of them. There were certainly other shows where the same was true, but that early emphasis as I learned helped ingrain it as a part of the stream’s culture.

Eventually though, I felt ready to move on. I still enjoyed playing the game, but I was interested in trying out other games and was getting tired of Nintendo’s system for online play. I was doing online matches with viewers, constantly fighting with poor connectivity through Nintendo’s mandatory online play service and dealing with the problems that matchmaking through an unnecessarily obtuse system caused. One day, it just didn’t feel worth the trouble so I stopped, and that was it. The afternoon broadcast quickly lost most of those extra viewers. Still, the channel, including the evening broadcast, definitely benefited from that time and exposure. Even today we still have regular viewers, lurkers, and subscribers who found the channel in that time and whom I’m happy to have met.

It is worth noting that when I stopped playing Pokemon entirely, it definitely impacted my audience. There’s the obvious drop in numbers where I would say 70-90% of those inflated single-game numbers evaporated. I had people asking on a daily basis when I would go back. I had people threaten to unfollow and unsubscribe from the channel. In nearly every case, I was able to smile kindly, thank them for their support, and wish them the best of luck with their time on Twitch. I had understood going in that this would occur. If you only play one game, you attract a lot of people that care about the game more than the person playing it.  I will say that losing out on some of the people I had come to know as friends hurt, but I don’t begrudge them their choice.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**An Analysis**

With all that in mind, we can look at that time through a business-like lens, trying to understand what worked out well and why.

* **Starting Size:** I didn’t break into streaming a single gaming with a non-zero audience. It may be possible to do so, but having at least a few people watching and chatting from the start definitely helps. Before I began, that very casual afternoon broadcast had between 25 and 40 concurrent viewers. I know this is more than many people will ever have on Twitch, but I would be lying if I said it wasn’t a factor when it came to initial discoverability. I’ll also note that I saw people enter the Pokemon community with smaller or initially non-existent audiences and see decent success. Growing from 5 average viewers to 200 average viewers wasn’t considered unreasonable if you put on a good show, had some luck, and gained some support from other broadcasters in the community.

* **Economic Moat:** In terms of a business, an economic moat is any factor that allows a business to maintain a competitive advantage over others in the field. It is difficult to overcome and protects the company from being overcome by competitors. For my broadcast, this was the capture-modded 3DS itself. It was a non-trivial purchase that many broadcasters simply couldn’t afford or weren’t aware of. It made entry into the field somewhat prohibitive and provided protection against competition. Early access can provide a similar advantage. In general, if you can find a way to do something that other broadcasters can’t do easily or won’t think to do, it’s to your benefit.

* **Networking:** Every broadcaster should be networking, and the results can be invaluable. There is an investment in time, but it can pay off in ways you never expect. We networked expecting nothing. This wasn’t any large-scale effort or plan, just one of the most basic forms of social media use out there. That instance of support came mostly as a surprise, and the initial introduction helped me make friends in the Pokemon streaming community. It allowed me to learn about similarly-sized broadcasters and smaller ones that would appreciate some support. I made some long term friends that I still know and support on Twitch today. All from taking a few seconds to retweet the work of someone who seemed worth it.

* **Don’t Be Afraid to Fuck Up And Look Bad:** This is probably the most important lesson I learned in my youth, and it has benefited me ever since. It’s alright to make a bit of an idiot of yourself or fail horrendously, especially to strangers and anonymous folks on the internet who you may never see again. If the options are between being quiet and never being noticed, or stepping outside of your comfort zone and possibly screwing up, it generally pays to get noticed. I was genuinely not good at Pokemon. I don’t feel I’m unintelligent, but learning was an experience that I would have much preferred to do in private. However, the opportunity existed then, and learning on stream as I went was one of the best choices I could have made.

* **Unique Brand:** I created an identity for the channel and did my best to stand out with it. It wasn’t anything crazy. I just placed a unique emphasis on fun and learning over competition and winning. I repeated the message, and did my best to live it. It became a part of the culture of the stream and attracted viewers who were interested in that unique experience. It wasn’t difficult. It wasn’t over the top. Compared to most examples of well-branded streams on Twitch, it probably seems simple and tame. But it worked. Standing out and creating a niche audience is possible within even the most saturated markets. You just need to find a way to do it.

* **Understand Your Product:** Every channel on Twitch that hopes to attract even a single viewer has a product they’re offering. It is the reason people spend their time watching and supporting rather than not. Your game choice, branding, and behavior make up huge parts of it. You’re putting that product out there and “selling” it to a potential audience. Know what your product is and what audience you’re trying to push it towards. For my Pokemon broadcasts, the product was a casual, fun-oriented show where failure was expected and learning was important. The audience was anyone looking to share knowledge or learn more about the game and participate in good-natured but semi-competitive battles. Most of the viewers were ages 13-30. Shaping that product and catering to the audience helped define the show and grow my audience. It also set expectations about what people should expect from the channel and what drove them to be there day after day.

* **Moderation:** Moderation is one of the most misused features on Twitch. A moderator is an extension of your will and a representation of your beliefs and policies in chat. It became very apparent early on in my Pokemon streams that the moderation style we used in our evening broadcast wouldn’t work. There was a larger chat base with a number of younger viewers. The afternoon stream had a specific emphasis on having fun and minimizing trolling. So, I ended up developing specific rules for moderating in the afternoon to accommodate. There were stricter rules to make the place a safe spot for younger viewers and to prevent people from insulting the decisions people made in line with the way the show was being ran. And at the same time, moderators needed to be slightly more willing to accommodate some chat spam while knowing the lines that couldn’t be crossed. We brought in new moderators to handle the new rules and many of our evening stream moderators that watched those afternoon broadcasts knew to leave moderation duties up to others.

* **Exit Plan:** I had an exit plan for when I was done playing Pokemon exclusively. I intended to stop, ignore the results, and continue on with the evening broadcast exactly as it was. I was a variety streamer and had continued on with my normal broadcasts in a separate space. Those afternoon broadcasts were an indulgence while I had free time in my schedule, and I went in expecting to stop when it was inconvenient. Honestly, I could have probably found a more productive way of transitioning from the game, but I understood the end result going in. Fundamentally changing your product, the basic thing that drives people to your channel, has large consequences.

    I watched many of my fellow Pokemon streamers get tired and give up one day. Audiences evaporated within a week and they didn’t know what to do. I knew a few variety broadcasters who had given up on their variety streams to play Pokemon exclusively. When they tried returning to variety broadcasting a year or more later, they found that their old audience was gone and their new audience only cared about them playing Pokemon. The most successful individuals I saw were those who managed to leverage their larger audience to move into another popular game at the time. Some people also found moderate success in playing Pokemon part of the time while slowly trying to bring other games into their repertoire. But most broadcasters were disappointed to see that even with their best efforts, they lost a significant portion of their single-game viewership when they finally moved on. 

    For someone who puts a large amount of effort into their broadcast, that loss of viewership and income have a definite impact. The change in channel culture and harassment can potentially make broadcasting a lot less fun. Just the knowledge that some of the people who you thought were your friends weren’t really there for you can end up hurting pretty badly. Know what you’re getting into, and be ready to deal with it.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

There’s probably more that can be said and I’m more than happy to answer any questions about something I left out. This was just my experience and I’ll be the first to admit that I benefited from a lot of luck along the way. Still, I hope you may have found some use reading it.

4z1qx7,Roleplaying Twitch Cateogry,"Let me start out by saying that there are some fantastic tabletop game streamers out there. Some that do it professionally and some that do it for fun. But something that's been bothering me lately is the use of the ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" game when there's a different system being played, be it Star Wars Edge of Empire, Pathfinder, or Call of Cthulhu. I'm not knocking these games in the least, they're all fantastic but they are not ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"". There's a Roll20 option which is what many of these streams use but it isn't nearly as popular which is why most of these channels are using the D&amp;D game option. 

My proposed solution is for Twitch to get rid of ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" as a game and create an all inclusive community around ""Roleplaying Game"" and allow the streamers to use hashtags in their titles to sort out the different games, much like the way the Creative community works currently on Twitch. 

There are a ton of Roleplaying Games out there and lumping them all into Dungeons &amp; Dragons when the system, setting and atmosphere may be completely different is doing a disservice to both Dungeons &amp; Dragons as well as a disservice to the game being played.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4z1qx7/roleplaying_twitch_cateogry/,1471887784.0,87,0.93,25,Twitch,Impius
4yz8m4,The state of programming on twitch ~ 6 months later,"Hey guys, 

This might be a little long, but I think it's an important issue for several members of the twitch community.

**Background:**

Here's the thing: for the past year I have been doing computational physics on twitch. I actually joined twitch because there was a specific ""game"" for programming at the time. After lurking in a few streams, I thought it would be a good idea to give the whole streaming thing a go. It ended up being an incredible success for a time (at least in my mind).

A few (~6) months ago, twitch revitalized their creative directory, which was great for many non-gamers who wanted to use twitch. It attracted viewers who just wanted to zone out and watch people make things, a somewhat different audience than the rest of twitch, but similar in many ways. 

At some point, twitch addressed many programming streamers and asked our opinion about switching to twitch creative. I asked my viewers and they were all vehemently opposed to the idea. We had our own little niche and people loved the programming game. It was a place where people could become better developers (of all sorts). Almost every one of my viewers was there to learn, and it was a fantastic community. 

In the case of the programming category, there was an even bigger reason we did not want to move to twitch creative: all of the game dev streamers were using the #programming tag. This might not seem like a big deal, but when your community averages ~50 concurrent viewers at all times and you are absorbed into a community that has ~200 concurrent viewers at all times and then thrown into a bigger community that has ~1000 concurrent viewers at all times... Well, you have lost your community. 

I spent a while outlining each of the reasons my viewers disliked the idea and then tried the creative category for a single stream. It was not great, so I politely told twitch that it was not the best move for the programming community. 

I am sure I was not the only one to say anything. No one in the programming community that I had spoken to thought the creative switch was a good move; however, one day (in the middle of stream), I was bumped into the creative section. No warning, really (besides the opinion e-mail sent before).

Since then, I have seen the old twitch programming community slowly leave (one by one). Earlier today, when I finished stream, I was the only non-gamedev streamer. That hit me hard. Everyone was gone. 

*Twitch effectively killed the programming community.*

The problem is that there is nowhere for us to go. Programming is not a section at all on youtube gaming and discoverability is rubbish on youtube live (also: the chat is not irc and livestreamer does not work well on youtube). Livecoding.tv is fine, but I don't trust the CEO for a number of personal reasons.

**A few quick notes:**

* As of right now the [#programming tag](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/programming) has ~20 streamers and ~170 viewers, of them ~3 streamers and ~4 viewers are doing non-gamedev programming. This is not representative of all times, but I thought I would put a few numbers on this post.

* My own streams are doing alright. I don't get as many as I did 6 months ago, sure... but that's not all Twitch's fault. I had to take a month off for personal reasons. This is not a post about me. I am looking for solutions to the current problem.

* If you are going to post something about how it is stupid to join a gaming community for non-gaming content, this post is not for you. That fact is that Twitch *was* for me a few months ago, now it is not.

* I strongly believe that programming content helps beginner programmers learn the ropes and gives veteran programmers the ability to tackle new problems they have not seen before. 

* [Post from just before the mandatory switch to creative](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40frlm/programming_on_twitch/)

* So far as I am aware, this is a unique problem to those watching and streaming programming on twitch (and it could have been avoided if twitch had listened to their community at the time). Let me know if there are similar problems elsewhere.

**Possible solutions:**

* Reinstate the old game dev and programming categories outside of twitch creative (not likely, but worth a shot).

* Ask streamers on creative to represent a single tag. For example: if a streamer is doing both programming and game dev, ask them to choose a community to represent so they do not appear in other categories. By default, they could represent only the first tag in their title. 

* **EDIT:** Another possibility is to simply prioritize those who have #programming first in their title so their streams always come before those who have it second or third and only highlight those who have #programming first on their list on the jumbotron for the programming community.

* Sorry, those were the only ~~two~~ three I could come up with. If you have further ideas, let me know!

**Side note:** 

Allow people to follow specific tags in creative. I don't want to follow creative, I want to follow programming.

Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text! I honestly just miss the old community and hate the fact that it is gone.

TL;DR: Before the creative switch, there used to be a vibrant programming community on twitch. It's gone now and I want it back.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 2: Quick note: I am supportive of the communities on twitch creative. I think they are a step in the right direction and really help viewers find the content they want. The issue here is that streamers are allowed to stream to multiple communities at once. This means that the viewers need to sift through a bunch of streams before finding the one they want. As mentioned, if we simply highlight the streamers within a community who have the community tag as first in their title, this should help out tremendously. Also: If you have a good suggestion, let me know and I'll update the post!

4ydiw2,PayPal updates Buyer Protection Policy,"PayPal posted a Notice of Amendment a few days ago and you can read it [here](https://www.paypal.com/se/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full?locale.x=en_EN).

The main take-aways:

&gt; **6. PayPal Buyer Protection**

&gt;&gt; 1. The following types of transactions are now excluded from coverage of PayPal Buyer Protection (section 13.3 is amended accordingly):

&gt;&gt; c. Payments on crowd-funding and/or crowd-lending platforms;

No more charge-backs on Kickstarter or Patreon. Now spurned users will need to seek out recovery from those services directly. Time for people to actually read up and care about refund policies.

&gt;&gt; e. Gambling, gaming and/or any activity involving a chance to win a prize;

No more charge-backs on CS:GO skin gambling websites.

&gt;&gt; h. donations;

I'm fairly certain PayPal means this in the 501(c) sense. The financial support that streamers receive from viewers are tips or gifts. Unless the Broadcaster is a registered charitable organization, they're unlikely to see any benefit from this change. However, it does mean that charities will be seeing less charge-backs coming from charity streams.

4y5zdk,Something weird happened during my stream..,"So I'm playing DayZ and this person appears in my chat. He's playing around with my bot, seeming harmless. Though he doesn't say anything directly to me, just activating my mIRC bot. After a minute, he finally asks, 

""wanna see somethin cool""

I tell him sure, and that I like cool things. Then two things happen.

1. The game starts lagging horribly. There was one point where it almost seemed like my guy in DayZ was being controlled by someone else. The few seconds after it ended, I just blamed the server lag.

2. I had been streaming for almost 2 hours with zero dropped frames. After the lag incident, I check OBS, and suddenly I am dropping almost 5000 frames. Needless to say, my stream ended right there. 

Afterwards I checked the VOD to see what the heck was going on, only to find out that the stream had cut right when I acknowledged his question. So Twitch didn't get any of the interesting bits. 

I don't know...one too many weird things happened at once when this person made contact with my stream. Is it mere coincidence? Or is someone out to get me via savage hacks. 

At least I got a follow out of it.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4y5zdk/something_weird_happened_during_my_stream/,1471445265.0,77,0.92,23,Twitch,EnoTheAwesome

4y0gn4,Build A Pull Down Green Screen for Streaming.,"So i've posted this tutorial in a few threads for people looking for help, but I wanted to make a post that would be easier to find for people new to chroma-key, looking for a convenient way to green screen. 

The worst part about incorporating a green screen into your stream is the setup and breakdown for every show. It's time consuming, it's annoying, lighting is never consistent and it's always a pain in the butt. So i'm here to show you how to setup a professional pull down screen screen for streaming that takes 10 seconds to setup and break down. 

For the original tutorial, [you can visit the post on my website here.](http://geekmatic.tv/build-an-awesome-green-screen-setup-for-twitch-v2-0/) Pictures, the tutorial video and part lists are all here. 

[Here is a link to the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvOgq3ri44Q)

Part list:

* x1 Square Perfect 4037 10′ x 13′ Chromakey Backdrop – $39.99
* x1 Fotodiox Single-Roller Set – $19.95
* x1 2″ wide, 10′ length PVC Pipe – $7.00
* x1 3/16 x 3″ Toggle Bolts – $8.00

Total Cost: $74.94

I have been rocking this setup for about 6 months, and it's worked fantastic.

4xoyys,"For Everyone Stuck in the Grind, Some Reflections on Growth","This is a post about growth, expectations, and goals for all the people carving out a few viewers or trying to grow a small audience. That’s probably most of us here on the subreddit and the majority of the people broadcasting on Twitch.

We’ve all seen the posts of people asking “How do I get viewers?” or “I got X followers in the past month, is that good?” And we respond to them a lot of ways. We point out that most channels grow slowly and some channels grow faster. We say that it takes luck to get noticed if you want your channel to take off. Bigger broadcasters point out there’s no formula that guarantees success and that the thing that worked for them won’t necessarily work for anyone else. Some people on the subreddit write guides, but those are like plans to starting a business. You can teach someone how to open a coffee shop that will eventually turn a profit, but good luck turning it into the next Starbucks.

Let’s forget all that and make things very simple. Instead, I propose a goal that’s relevant to any new or growing broadcaster: **everything you do should aim to make one new, true fan**.

About two years back, /u/Brawli55 made a similar post and it felt like it was time to bring the topic up again. If you’ve never heard of the [The 1000 True Fan Theory](http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/), it is a good read. In short, the idea is that any artistic endeavor can be supported if there are about 1000 dedicated people who are life-long fans. Making your endeavor successful means finding those people and keeping them interested. 

Rather than worrying about follower counts or concurrent viewer numbers, worry about finding new regular viewers and keeping your current regulars engaged. That’s advice that some [pretty successful broadcasters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djyOfrwWGbp471-fdHJgPCZwzFo3aD2mDZT-1Zcwenk/edit) have been giving for years. Those regulars are the heart of your broadcast. The start of your 1000 true fans. They’ll show up for almost anything you do, tell their friends about your channel, and support you through your roughest times. Even if they don’t watch everything you put out, they still remember your channel and try to support you.

Once you start thinking that way, setting goals for your channel becomes easy. You can start simple. Something like “every week, I want to try to make one new, True fan.” And all of the things you do should focus on that. Always ask yourself, “how does what I’m doing help me reach another true fan?” You might be making forum posts, trying out a new hashtag, or doing something that puts your name in front of a lot of people. Maybe your game choice is something entirely different for you and you’re almost guaranteed to see some fresh new names in chat. Great! Now put on the best show you can and maximize your chances of getting another regular viewer. Also, you’ll probably come to realize that not every idea you have actually brings in true fans. When you start viewing your efforts through that lens, you’ll see places where your time could be better spent in order to find true fans.

Getting true fans definitely requires effort, but that small incremental effort adds up over time. 50 new true fans a year might not seem like a lot, but that’s a basis you can grow from. And sometimes you’ll see more. A solid new game choice or a bit of luck in general can help your exposure and increase the number of people that want to see you succeed. 

Sometimes, growth will be slow. You might go weeks or months without seeing a change in your viewer count. You might backslide and see less people in your channel. Before you get worried, stop and think about your true fans. Chances are, they’re still with you. Chances are, you’ve gained a few new ones even as your overall numbers dropped. And if you’re working hard, you might even be getting more as you go. Audience sizes change. They fluctuate at different times of the year, influenced by game choice and schedules. And that doesn’t matter. Your true fans matter. Remembering that might help get you through even the roughest times.

I want to include a concrete example that’s close to my heart. About a year and a half ago when /u/Brawli55 talked about the 1000 true fan theory, he pointed out some numbers about our stream. At the time, we’d been broadcasting for about two years with around 15,000 followers and concurrent viewer counts between 120-250. In the time since then, we haven’t seen explosive growth. Life’s forced us to spend less time on our broadcast than we’d like and change our hours, hurting our growth. Our follower count has only gone up to about 19,000 and our average concurrent viewer counts have stayed about the same, with some a decent sized drop coinciding with the normal summer slump. 

The interesting thing though? Brawli pointed out that at the time, we should have had about 100 true fans and our interactions with regulars and channel subscription numbers were incredibly close to that number. I looked at our sub count today, again about a year and a half since his post, and did some rough counts based on the people interacting on Discord, Twitter, our Twitch chat, and the names on our sub list. If we’re hitting our goal of one new fan a week, we should have about 75 more true fans today. Despite not seeing much growth based on concurrent viewers or follower count, we’ve been meeting and exceeding our true-fan growth goals. And that makes me happy.

4xa5be,TwitchTimer - Free Countdown for Streamers,"#TwitchTimer
##Free Countdown for Twitch Streamers!

*Hi everybody!*

We would love to present you guys our cooldown timer.

We are two engineering students that for chance encountered a streamer in need of a nice countdown for his upcoming marathon. We overkilled it just a bit.

Folks liked it so much that we decided to make a website out of it and here you go: as you might have guessed it's called [**TwitchTimer!**](https://twitchtimer.com)

It's easy to use with **OBS** and **Xsplit** and being fully integrated with **Twitch** and **TwitchAlerts**, this clock picks up automatically when your viewers subscribe or donate and updates the timer, amazing them with one of the ever-incrementing animations (currently 41). 

If you'd like to have a taste of it just visit [*our website*](https://twitchtimer.com) and click on **Try It!**

We are new to both Reddit and the Twitch community so we would really love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

**Happy Streaming!**

*The TwitchTimer developers, Luca and Tommaso*

###Primary features:

* **Cooldown**: perfect for marathons. You set a starting time (e.g. 24 hours) and you let your viewers increment it by donating at your price.
* **Countdown**: thought for events. As above you can pick a time but your viewers can now crumble away the time by donating.
* **Timer**: useful for speed-runners. It is not an high-precision chronometer but it shows the time elapsed since you fired it.
* **Clock**: a normal clock. Kind off. It shows the current time. Except when it suddenly drops acids and transforms into Nikola Tesla.

###Side features:

* *Manual donations and subscribers*: if you do not use TwitchAlerts or do not possess a subscriber program you can nonetheless use TwitchTimer by inserting them manually.
* *Manual animations*: you can start animations without any donation to trigger it.

###Required features:
* *Follower Sync*: let viewers edit time by following the streamer.
* *Timer planification*: plan in advance when the timer will start ticking.
* *Start/Pause/Stop*

Do you think that an important feature is missing? *Please let us know!*

4wz5ny,I've built an app called TwitchAutomator it detects what games you are playing and adjusts stream titles + Game Played accordingly.,"Hi all, I figured this might be best put here considering it's for you guys!

I've created a tool which utilises the games list from Twitch (Which can be added too) and your own custom title + Game changing list to create a nice bot which will detect when you change games and update your stream based on whatever game you are playing.

Say you want your title to be:

World Of Warcraft [Legion Fun] You can set that in the config and have it auto change when you next switch to Warcraft.

It's something I did for fun, you might like it you might not, Accepting all feedback I want to make this something streamers find useful rather than a pain.

The problem is, Twitch Clips were deleted because of TOS breaking, it literally says ""Whoops. Something went wrong.
This clip has been removed due to terms of service violations."" Yet the streamers suffered no consequences from this?

I'm not trying to witch-hunt anyone on particular, but is this how Twitch is going to handle this types of situations? Or are there way different TOS for Clips and regular Twitch? Besides I don't think it makes any sense as most people will start moving to previous services for clipping or just upload it at Youtube to not suffer from censorship...

PS: I'm not telling Twitch how they should moderate their partnered (or not) streamers, that's up to them. But recognizing something that is in a clip as a TOS violation, but not the stream?

4w954u,Relentless spam bots in popular streams,"So for the past week, in several popular League of Legends streams, there are a TON of spam bots who spam stuff about a random girl and her stream/img/imgur, random sexual stuff, and random passages from a book or something. Even in a stream with 8k viewers they completely overrun the chat, and despite moderators banning them every day, new ones pop up. Submode ends up being the only solution. Adding ban phrases is tough because there are many different spam phrases that are used, and I think the person who is running the bot scripts is aware to some extent and could just change the spam to bypass.

Dear “Why am I not getting any viewers?” Broadcasters,

*PSA: If you’re not interested in growth on Twitch.tv, you can stop reading right now.*

Who I am is not important; I’m not here to promote my own channel. It will have to suffice to say that I’ve been streaming on Twitch for a few years and have had what I consider to be a good amount of success on Twitch.tv, enough so that it is currently my full-time job. I'm not special in any way; I just have a different perspective on things based upon a good amount of experience.

What I’m about to tell you is not going to be sugar-coated in any way. People here that try to give others good critical feedback are often down-voted because, well, this is Reddit, and most of those posts asking about how to increase viewership are made by people who think they’re special snowflakes and that there must be something wrong with everyone else because nobody is watching them. But they’re not special, and they’re not going to progress until they come to that realization. This is just the way it is, and if it hurts someone’s feelings, I don’t care. Let’s get started.

**You are not entitled to anything.**

We all see these posts on a daily basis, usually more than once on the same page. “Hey, I’ve been streaming for XX weeks/months now, why isn’t anybody watching me?! My friends say I’m funny and outgoing, but nobody is tuning in!!! What’s wrong!?!?!? WHY DOESN'T ANYONE SUPPORT THE SMALLER CHANNELS LIKE MINE?!?!?!?!!!!!!!”

What’s wrong is that the people making those posts have a sense of entitlement; they believe that, hey, because they’re streaming, people should be watching, and that's as far as their train of thought goes. They believe that, out of the 1.4 MILLION broadcasters on Twitch.tv (a number that is somewhat suspect to me), somehow, some way, they’re deserving of more attention than those other 1.4 million people. And that is complete and utter bullshit.

They’re not special. You’re not special, either. I sure as hell ain’t special. There are many reasons that people who have built up a following on Twitch have succeeded, but the biggest reason is that they worked hard for it, often for several years. They didn’t *expect* people to watch—they worked their asses off so that *people had a reason to watch in the first place*.

“But playing videos games is fun and easy! Why would you need to work at it?” Because, you knuckleheads, when you’re streaming, you’re doing more than playing games (or cooking or painting or eating food or whatever else Twitch allows these days)—if you are expecting people to watch you, then you are saying to the world, “I am an entertainer.” And that brings us to the next point…

**If you’re an entertainer, then BE ENTERTAINING.**

Remember those posts I mentioned a moment ago by the people who wonder why nobody watches them when they’re so obviously passionate about video games and absolutely hilarious? One day, I decided to follow up on three such posts, just to see how amazingly entertaining these people supposedly were. I have a stopwatch/timer built into my keyboard, and as soon as I joined those channels, I started the timer.

*Every single one of those broadcasters was either completely silent (or almost completely silent) for 10 minutes*. Imagine this scenario:

My favorite comedian is performing in my city, and I shell out $50 to go see him. I take my seat, and after a few minutes, the house lights go down, and the audience starts cheering. Then the spotlight hits Stage Left, and out walks, well, let’s say it’s Jim Gaffigan, because I really like that guy. So Jim walks to center stage, and he waves to everyone, and after a moment the crowd quiets down and gets ready for Jim to do his thing.

But Jim just stands there, doing nothing. Or maybe he’s looking around and waving to people, but he’s not saying anything. Maybe he even does a little soft-shoe shuffle, and that might elicit a few chuckles from the crowd, but still, other than that, Jim isn’t saying anything. I think it’s safe to say that most of the people in the audience that shelled out $50 to listen to Jim would be very disappointed if, for 10 minutes, Jim didn’t say anything funny.

If you haven’t figured it out by now, *you’re Jim*. Maybe comedy isn’t your strong point, and it doesn’t have to be, but if you expect people to watch you, you have to keep them entertained. *Twitch is an interactive entertainment medium*, which is something that seems to go over the head of so many people. People don’t tune in to hear you say something every 10 minutes, or every 5 minutes, or once every minute. Unless there’s a cutscene in the game and you’re being quiet so that your viewers can hear that dialog, you need to be doing something to engage your viewers at all times. “But Jesus Christ, that’s sounds like such hard work! I don’t know what I should be saying or doing!! What should I be saying or doing?!?!”

By golly, yes, it *is* hard work. Do you think Jim goes out on stage every night not knowing what he’s going to say? Don’t you think it’s plausible that, at some point, he sat down and at least outlined the topics he was going to talk about? And seeing as how timing is an important part of comedy, he likely took some time to practice the delivery of his content as well, dontcha think? That's what is known as a *work ethic*. So if you’re wondering what **you** should be saying or doing to keep viewers engaged, don’t look to me or anyone else for answers, because *it’s your fucking job to figure that out*. It’s your channel, and *you are solely responsible for your content.* Even if Jim had a staff of writers creating his stand-up routine for him (and he doesn’t), he would still need to work to make it entertaining when he’s out there on that stage.

We’re talking about *live content* here. You don’t get the chance to edit and fix things in post-production like you would with a YouTube video. You have to be energized and engaging the entire time that you’re broadcasting, because the moment you stop putting in that effort is the moment you’re showing people the door and asking them to find something better to watch. Do you think it takes hard work just to get people to *find* your channel? I would agree that yes, it’s hard work, but not nearly as hard as the work you’ll need to put in to *keep* them there. You can get raided every day by the biggest streamers on Twitch, and during those raids your follower numbers will shoot up because that’s what happens during raids. And then, when those raids are over, you’ll go back to your low viewer count because you’re not putting forth the effort to keep people engaged.

Stop asking others how you can come out of your shell and be entertaining; stop asking others what games you should be playing; take some time to do a Google search to figure out how shit like OBS works instead of asking others to hold your hand and do it for you. *Stop asking others to do your job for you.* Grow a pair and take complete responsibility for your content. You can take all of the credit if you succeed, but you also need to be prepared to take the blame when you fail.

**There’s no such thing as “being fake” if you’re being entertaining.**

Going back to Jim as an example, you don’t actually believe that all of the things that most comedians say on stage are true, do you? Sure, many of their routines are based upon real-life situations, but many scenarios are just flat-out fabrications, and we’re OK with that as long as that shit is funny, right?

Yet people here complain and worry about how they are going to be perceived by their audience. People here call out others for “being fake” for any number of reasons. Tell those people to fuck off, because again, in case you missed it earlier, *it’s your channel*. If you want to be yourself, be yourself. If you want to express yourself with a sock puppet, do that. If you want to be a character from your favorite anime or something otherwise completely made up, just do it. You don’t even need to do anything unique, which is something you see people here frequently offer as advice; *you just need to do whatever you’re doing better than most people here*, which is not that hard at all given the very low bar for content quality on Twitch. There are several good reasons why people with no viewers consistently sit at the bottom of the viewer counts, and most of those reasons boil down to a lack of effort. Putting forth more effort than they do will help you to rise above the bottom of that shit-pile.

When you’re live, you need to be the best version of you that you can be. For some of you charismatic, talkative, outgoing people out there, being yourself is just fine. For the rest of you, you’re going to have to work at it. How, you ask? *Again, that’s your job to figure that out*, and if you know what it is that you really want to do, don’t let others dissuade you from doing it (ToS violations notwithstanding).

Calling out someone for “being fake” is no different than complaining that the scenarios portrayed in your favorite TV show or movie are not very realistic, because, hey, no shit, *it’s entertainment*. Even if every day of your real life is just like a new episode of “Friends”, sometimes you’ll still want something different, something more fantasy than reality, because otherwise real life is all we would ask for.

**”But I AM talented and entertaining, I swear! Everyone says so!”**

Good for you! That’s awesome! Here’s something to help you gain some perspective:

For every person you see on the big screen in the movie theater, there are hundreds if not thousands more would-be actors who are equally talented that are still waiting for their big break while they bus tables at some hole-in-the-wall Los Angeles café. Even with all of that talent, they still have to work hard to get noticed, and most of them will never make it to that big screen. Yes, even with all of that hard work, there can still be some luck involved, and not everyone sees their big dreams come to fruition.

Of course, the above scenario is only applicable if you have something of value to offer, and the unfortunate truth for many of you is that you just don’t have what it takes, even though you may think you do. The things you do among your small circle of friends might make them laugh, but it may not play well to a larger audience. That’s the true test; the laughs or approval you get from people you know may come because they know you and are comfortable around you, but when you’re in front of a crowd of strangers, the reactions you get can be brutally honest. Having no viewers for a long period of time is the most brutally honest feedback you can get. It’s a message with a degree of clarity to which no feedback in this forum can compare.

If you can objectively say that you’ve put everything you have into broadcasting for a year and you’re still not getting any viewers, then you’re not going to progress without making some drastic changes, because what you’ve been doing just isn’t working.

**Life if not fair; neither is Twitch. And no one is “stealing your viewers”. Get over it.**

Almost every page on this subreddit has a post by someone complaining about some broadcaster on Twitch. “She’s barely wearing anything!” “He’s only getting viewers because of a gimmick!” “They’re only popular because they got raided by [insert “big streamer” name here]!”

Some people (usually other broadcasters) also believe that broadcasters that fit the examples given above are “stealing views from ‘legit’ streamers”. And if you’re one of those people with such beliefs, fuck you, because you’re a complete idiot.

So you think you might have more viewers if Twitch perma-banned “xXBigBoobsBarbie69Xx”? Really? Then let me ask you this: what does your channel have in common with hers? You’ll probably answer, “Nothing! I am SO much better than her!” OK then, if your channel has nothing in common with hers, then *why the fuck would any of her viewers suddenly flock to your channel if she were banned?* If she gets banned, her viewers are going to find someone else providing similar content, because *that’s what they want to watch*. And because you were so busy complaining, you probably didn't notice that she has some high-quality overlays, along with above-average audio/video quality, meaning that she knows something about production values. She probably knows more about what it takes to keep people entertained than you ever will.

No one has the right to dictate what others can or should watch on Twitch. People are going to watch whatever they want to watch, regardless of how you might try to influence them. And consider this: have you ever heard the phrase “there’s no such thing as bad publicity?” That holds true for content on Twitch; every time you complain about someone and call them out and try to convince people not to watch them, you are effectively advertising their channel. People are going to go watch them just to see what all of the fuss is about, and guess what? Some of those people might actually stick around. They might become regular viewers. They might subscribe to that channel (if applicable) and/or tip that broadcaster. So good job! You’re actually promoting the very content you despise because, as I pointed out earlier, you’re a complete fucking idiot.

It’s also true that some people can get away with crazy shit on Twitch, while others might get banned just for looking at the camera cross-eyed. And yes, that’s not fair. It’s true that Twitch plays favorites. In that sense, Twitch is a microcosm of real life, and complaining about it isn’t going to change anything. Go ahead and report a channel if you truly believe that the broadcaster in question is committing an egregious offense that violates the terms of service. But if you’ve filed several reports on that person and Twitch hasn’t done anything, then you can rest assured Twitch is generally OK with what that person is doing. At that point, your time might be better spent finding channels that you enjoy watching instead of continually complaining about something you don’t like. If you’re a broadcaster, that time would certainly be better spent making improvements to your own content. I know that sounds like super-obvious advice from Mr. Super-Obvious Guy, but it apparently needs to be stated because we see these posts every day.

**Some people in this subreddit have no idea what they are talking about.**

As streaming becomes more accessible, more and more people are going to start streaming, and that means a substantial percentage of the content you see here is going to come from people that don’t have a lot of experience. It’s great that people want to share what they know; unfortunately, some people don’t know jack-shit.

One of my recent favorite examples is about what non-partners can and can’t do. This one is from the *Twitch Bible, Bannable Offenses, Chapter 3, Verse 12*:

*And the Supreme N00b Broadcaster sayeth, “Verily I say unto you, non-partners must not stream above 30fps. It is an abomination, and upon you shall a pox be cast, and you shall be cast out of the Twitch Garden if you try to stream at 60fps.”*

Which, of course, is complete bullshit, because the aforementioned Twitch Bible doesn’t exist, nor does any rule exist preventing non-partners from streaming at 60fps. Yet people spout this stuff as if some deity from on high relayed this information via a burning bush and carved some words into stone tablets promising to smite anyone violating said non-existent rule.

There’s also a deluge of “advice” from people that have been streaming for one week and finally got their first follower and, in a rush of excitement, decided to share their “formula for success” with all of the other new broadcasters. From my perspective, most of these posts are thinly veiled channel advertisements, but even if the poster has nothing but the best intentions, the advice is, at best, something that has been regurgitated hundreds of times. There are often things mentioned that could have potentially negative consequences because, as the header for this section mentions, these people have no real experience to draw upon. I’m talking about ideas or incorrect information such as “follow-for-follow” schemes; “shout-out for shout-out” schemes; “get a bigger channel to raid you” schemes (which would require a topic of its own to explain); “tips aren’t taxable” posts (which might be true in some places, but KNOW FOR CERTAIN that it’s applicable to someone asking about it); and who-knows-what-else.

I’m not saying moderators should censor these posts; I’m saying that the people making these posts should be censoring themselves because they don’t know what they’re talking about. Consider the following: you have a problem with your car; it’s not running properly, and you don’t know enough about cars to fix it yourself. I—the person writing this post—also know practically nothing about fixing motor vehicles. I can, however, change my own oil; I’ve done it countless times over the years. Would you trust me to fix your car, just because I know how to change the oil? I hope not, because I sure as hell wouldn’t. Such “advice” is probably better saved for use as words-of-encouragement, such as a simple, “yeah, I had no viewers for a long time, but I kept at it, worked on my content, and now I have fun people to hang with when I stream”.

Having the enthusiasm and desire to help other people is great; having the knowledge and experience to make that offer meaningful is also important, otherwise that offer may not be helpful at all.

**There’s so much more to say, but very few people made it this far.**

And that’s OK. As I stated some 3,000 words ago, I just needed to get this out there, and I figured that this was the best way to say it because this same information doesn’t seem to be sinking in when people try to present it in a nice, politically-correct format, and there are only a handful of contributors that even bother to be honest in the first place. The majority of what goes on here is just one big circle-jerk.

Upvote or downvote as you wish; this will disappear into the past in a few days, and in the end, nothing will have changed. Perhaps one person will benefit from this while it’s still visible, and if so, you’re welcome. Otherwise, my time is best spent working on my own content, because I actually care about the value and quality of my broadcast, for my own sake, and for the sake of my viewers.

4vht5v,Poor 60 FPS Twitch (HTML5) video performance (Skipped frames) caused by Nvidia Adaptive Sync Half-Refresh Rate,"I noticed that when watching 60 FPS Twitch streams, the video was choppy, with low FPS, and was generally unwatchable in Chrome.

After a couple of hours of trying to fix it,  I eventually found the problem. The issue was nVidia's adaptive sync (half refresh rate). Given my displays 60hz and the 60 fps video, it was skipping half of the frames to attempt to output 30 fps. Unfortunately it wasn't every other frame, it was instead random bunches of frames, so the video was AWFUL. 


After changing the vsync setting, the problem went away!


This infuriated me for a couple of hours, so hopefully it helps someone else out there.

4u14sx,Safety at Twitch Con,"Hello everyone. I need to get serious for a few minutes. I know I will sound like a broken record, and I apologize about that. However, this needs to be said.

I was present at Twitch Con 2015, and was made aware of the After Parties through other people. Since Twitch Con 2015, there has been crimes committed by Twitch people, against other Twitch people. I am not talking petty theft, I am talking about stuff like assault or worse (against male and females). Alcohol Poisoning has happened too. 

I have tried telling this to a Staff Member, and encouraged them to seek better Security, or hire the Police. The San Diego Special Events Police estimate is 96 an hour for 4 Officers and a Sergeant. The response I got was disheartening. They do not wish to seek this kind of help (is my understanding).

That means you all will be on your own. I would feel better if you all traveled in pairs during this event. If no one has a pair, please offer to go with them. 

For females, the Strip Tests for your drinks, are only $10 a pack. I highly encourage that you get a pack before partying. 

Lastly, I encourage you all to use the non-emergency Police numbers for anything suspicious. If it is serious of course call 911.

You can find the non emergency numbers on the San Diego Police Department Website. I wont link it to avoid needing to ask permission from mods. When you get there, look for Central Division. It is my understanding that is the number for the Gaslamp District. 

The San Diego Convention Center covers 2 jurisdictions. The back side is considered Harbor Police, while the front is Central. 

That is the most I have. Please stay safe. I am only one person. I can't protect everyone. Enjoy!

4u0473,Twitch and the Lack of Transparency,"First of all, I would like to say that I’m writing this because I’ve noticed other people with an opinion similar to this and I’d like to express it to the public. The topic I’d like to focus on is Twitch and their transparency. For a while now it feels as if Twitch haven’t been open with their own community, often ignoring situations or leaving their users in the dark. Rather than expressing their ideas, progress, or updates; it’s silent.

**Social Eating Implementation**

Let’s take a look at some of things Twitch have recently done, such as, the implementation of the Social Eating category. In my opinion, the way Twitch implemented this category felt entirely backwards. To specify, Twitch released this category without any rules or any information about it whatsoever. It had an “over the night” discovery that caused a lot of confusion within the community. 

Without any rules announced, people were banned/punished and generally confused about this category. A few wondered if this content was even allowed since it wasn’t gaming, creative, or music related. At the end of the day, Twitch did make an (late) announcement about it and posted a set of rules, but this could have been avoided if they were more upfront to their users and posted earlier.

**Features**

Another communication problem with Twitch is their lack of updates on projects. On September 25, 2015 Twitch announced a full HTML5 video player ([blog post](https://blog.twitch.tv/twitchcon-2015-keynote-product-round-up-4133f31a8bdf#.yxzfb3k8t)) stating, 

&gt;[By Q2, 2016 we’re bringing you the full HTML5 player. Say goodbye to Flash forever](https://secure.twitch.tv/twitch/v/17714623?t=42m18s). 

Between that date and until June 30, 2016 (The last day of Q2, 2016) there was never an update or announcement made about the progress of the HTML5 video player. When they did release their [update on June 30](https://blog.twitch.tv/coming-soon-html5-video-player-beta-cdb94b026a8c#.s88n82h3p) explaining why it wasn’t ready to roll out, it felt disappointing. From what I understand, this was their first update on HTML5 since the TwitchCon announcement and it took them till the last minute to fill us in. 

It’s fairly reasonable to have issues come about and halt development, but without communicating those issues earlier, it creates frustration within the community. For example, look at this [tweet](https://twitter.com/twitchsupport/status/420961861975031809) from 2014 announcing a name change service. No additional information or announcement was provided – still leaving people upset till this day. In my opinion, a statement explaining to the public that their progress has been delayed or cancelled is sufficient for the community. 

A while back Twitch implemented [changes to audio in VODS](https://blog.twitch.tv/important-changes-to-audio-in-vods-35939b33ee2a#.kjogj5lmh). This was poorly communicated to the community. As a result, the CEO of Twitch, responded by stating, 

 Note: (Point 3 in opening post) 

&gt; [Lack of communication ahead of time: This was our bad. I'm glad we communicated the change to VOD storage policy in advance, giving us a chance to address issues we missed like 2-hour highlights for speedrunners before the change went into effect. I'm not so glad we failed on communicating the audio-recognition change in advance, and wish we'd posted about it before it went into effect. That way we could have gotten community feedback first as we're doing now after the fact.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2cwfu2/i_am_twitch_ceo_emmett_shear_ask_me_almost/) 

He also goes on and replies to a few people by saying things such as,

&gt; [Simply put: we screwed up and should have announced it ahead of time. Sorry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2cwfu2/i_am_twitch_ceo_emmett_shear_ask_me_almost/cjjp9kc?context=3)

And

&gt; [In this case, internal miscommunication. Generally we try to announce things ahead of time (and do so) -- see our recent release of host mode.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2cwfu2/i_am_twitch_ceo_emmett_shear_ask_me_almost/cjjqdbd?context=3)

And

&gt; [I regret that we didn't notify the community about this before we launched it. We did that for the change to the VOD storage policy, and I'm glad we did. We didn't in this case and that was a mistake.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2cwfu2/i_am_twitch_ceo_emmett_shear_ask_me_almost/cjkasqf?context=3)

And

&gt; [Because you have to take the first step in order to take the second. I regret not pre-announcing the changes, which would have avoided some (but certainly not all) of the reaction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2cwfu2/i_am_twitch_ceo_emmett_shear_ask_me_almost/cjkaljj?context=3)

This shows that they most likely understand the impact of being transparent (and vice-versa) with the community. Nevertheless, it feels as if they still continue to lack transparency.

**Stay True to your Word**

Furthermore, I’d like to bring up the lack of communication in a recent [post they made](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4qhlc4/subscriber_emote_review_and_recent_scuttlebutt). A few weeks back they posted a thread on /r/twitch about the recent emote situation and ended the post with, 

&gt; [Thanks for your time. We look forward to answering some of your related questions.](http://i.imgur.com/UUPNImU.png)

There was even a tweet by @TwitchSupport stating, 

&gt; [Staff will also answer some related questions after!](https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/746517297053859840)

However, none of the questions were answered – literally zero replies to anyone from that thread by Twitch staff. Again, shows lack of transparency and communication even when they stated they would be willing to answer questions. But more importantly, this seems like a **constant** issue.

It's even noted in the thread that communication was a problem in regards to how they handled the recent emote changes by stating,

&gt; **Why did we not message in advance?** Looking back, we likely could have messaged we were going to do so and posted the guidelines in advance.

While they acknowledge their problems of informing the community before making changes to features. They still failed to acknowledge their lacked of engaging the community by ignoring the questions in that post

**Closing Thoughts**

I understand that Twitch is busy, with limited resources, and focusing their attention on more important issues. I also understand that Twitch hires different people for different things - not everyone's job is to engage with us. I just wanted to express some thoughts I had about their lack of communication/transparency.

However for the points outlined above, especially being able to rewind a bit and pause streams when something important comes up, YT simply blows Twitch out of the water for gaming tournaments. 

Are there any plans to implement these features in the future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4trtlo/from_rleagueoflegends_why_i_watch_tournaments_on/,1469030190.0,88,0.87,18,Twitch,GamerByt3

4tfl9m,How to Report: Pokemon GO Streamers / Spoofers - With Evidence,"Hey there folks! There has been quite a lot of discussion going on in the reddit and another forums about the streamers that are using GPS spoofing programs.

I have also noticed that some folks that apparently don't know the game are doing unnecessary reports. When someone is just using incense at their own home.

So i created a tutorial how anyone that would like to see this hacking style go away. Can report these streams with real evidence. So it's really simple for the folks at Twitch and Niantic check out the issue. And hopefully deal with the situation in minutes not hours.

**Here is the article:** [How to Report Pokemon GO Streamers / Spoofers - With Evidence](http://nikitheliger.com/how-to-report-pokemon-go-streamers-spoofers-with-evidence/)

Hopefully it will help out to deal with these that are most likely Team Rocket fans :) If you got some questions or suggestions for the article would be awesome to hear about it.

**Update: 1**

- Seems that some folks that don't know the game are still reporting legit streamers. That use incense at their home. So i added a picture that hopefully clarifies this.
- Also added a clarification for the time the process takes.. It can be quite faster.

**Update: 2**

- Added clarification for the rules and links to Pokemon GO Trainer guidelines witch says cheating isn't allowed. You can link for the specific website with your Reports to make it easier for the folks to handle the reports.

Thanks for the comments and insights folks :)

**Update: 3**

4t8wrw,Lack of rule enforcement when it comes to partnered streamers,"So with each passing scandal it is getting more laughable with the way Twitch chooses to deal with them.

Whereas a regular, non-partnered streamer seemingly can get banned for the smallest infraction, the partners on twitch now 
seem to be running the aylum. I may be miscounting, or missing people, but the only times this year I can recall partners 
actually being permanently banned on twitch, is when it got the attention of the authorities out in the wider world, negative press 
or game companies were putting pressure on them to do something about particular streamers.

With all the latest CS:GO betting scandal coming out over the past few weeks, Twitch as usual was slow to react and would have done
nothing, if not for Valve who are also at fault for not doing anythingsooner. Yet the streamers who have commited fraud on THEIR platform seemingly get away scot free, while claiming ignorance when there is concrete proof about their duplicity.

The latest streamer implicated just a few hours ago, will again, I'm sure not even get a warning, let alone a ban, what will it take for partners to actually be banned? Particularly with this CS:GO stuff, would it take criminal proceedings for them to take action?

One of the big issues I have seen over a long period of time, is that a lot of the bigger streamers, the ones that can get away with literal murder on stream, are so friendly with the staff, some of whom are literal streamer groupies in their interactions in chat. I personally still feel it may be considered a conflict of interest for staff to be subscribed to stremers, but that's just my personal opinion. These same staff are the ones looking out for these people, and deflecting a lot of the flak away, and I get that, their friends, but they should keepo business and personal seperate, as they are at this point consistently making Twitch look amateurish.

Again I understand, this is pretty much all about the money at this point, and why would Twitch ban someone who gets 10k+ viewers? Wouldn't it be better to have a platform with respected honest stremers, instead of letting some of your partners literally commit criminal actions on your site, just so you can get a little more ad and sub revenue?

This is just a minor vent (I have a LOT of issues with some of the dumb stuff that has been going on lately) and I am pretty much convinced, that nothing will change, the site will keep going downhill at this current rate, and I don't care how viewers may be going up....the site is just becoming worse, from the top down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4t8wrw/lack_of_rule_enforcement_when_it_comes_to/,1468745793.0,378,0.85,151,Twitch,[deleted]
4t406u,Let lurkers lurk.,"One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to viewing a stream on Twitch is when the streamer talks to me when I've said nothing in chat. Look, I understand that if I'm you're only viewer you're excited to see me viewing your stream. I understand that you think interacting with your viewers is the way to keep viewers. I even understand that you are simply trying to be kind and welcoming to make me feel comfortable. But what you don't know is that it makes me feel uncomfortable. It annoys me because then I feel obligated to speak to you when I really didn't want to say anything. It makes me not want to watch because I know you're going to talk to me the entire time and I'm not looking for conversation. And lastly, it makes me not follow you. 

Now you might be asking why and the reason why is because sometimes I don't want to talk. I just want to watch or listen. I turn a random stream on to have it play as background noise while I'm doing other things. I'm not looking for interaction. I'm not looking to be greeted. I just want to have the stream playing in the background and if the streamer just so happens to say something funny or if I happen to look over and like what I see I'll follow them. If I want to be social I'll say something. 99.9% of the time when I'm lurking that's what I want to do. Lurk! I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. 

So please, if you're a streamer be mindful that not everyone wants to talk to you. Some people want to come in, watch you play the game and not say anything. You don't have to greet every viewer you have. I would recommend you don't greet anyone unless they speak in chat. Otherwise you run the risk of running a potential follower away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4t406u/let_lurkers_lurk/,1468664268.0,383,0.9,130,Twitch,babybluebeam

4spvhs,Just FYI to all streamers ....,"I just had a pretty big streamer host me last night, and his viewers were the most annoying/rude/crude people I’ve ever met on Twitch so far.  They spammed up my chat, even when my mods asked them to calm down.  Acted like they owned my stream. Kept praising the guy who hosted and said I should date him, etc.  It was so bad that some of my regulars had to leave because they got annoyed too.  I had to mod at least 7 people to timeout anyone who did not stop spamming.  The guy who hosted joined the chat and just played along, didn’t even tell his viewers to stop, even when I politely asked them to.  He wasn’t rude or annoying like his viewers, but he still laughed along.  I’ve watched his streams before since he’s usually on the top of the list of the game I stream, and he seemed decent . . . until last night.  His viewers just made him look so bad.  I now have a really bad image of him.  If anyone ever asks me about him (not on stream), I know that I will definitely not have anything good to say about him.

Just to all streamers out there, your viewers are an embodiment of you.  They represent who you are.  If you host another person, the streamer will see how your viewers act, and will most likely judge you based upon that.

4s3u50,Today was my best stream in the 6 months of doing it. This is what I learned.,"First, I didn't get hundreds (or even dozens) of new followers, but I made new friends and today was the most *fun* I've had streaming, which is far more valuable long term.

Second, I do creative stuff mostly, but I feel that most of this still applies to games as well.

**TL;DR:**

* Stream during busy times like evenings and weekends.
* Long streams can really retain an audience.
* Variety can really help bring new people in.
* Social eating is weird, but pretty cool.
* Announce when you're doing social media stream reminders.
* Being engaging with your audience is the by far the most important thing you can do on Twitch. Even above and beyond good gameplay.

**Longer version**

Today, on a whim, I decided to stream some backlogged music work. I've been pushing through a bunch of projects and was feeling burnt out. Mostly I decided to stream because I know that if I didn't I'd waste my entire day watching Netflix.

Man, weekends are a great time to stream, I should do more ""prime time"" stuff! I ended up streaming for over 6 hours straight, which is absolutely ridiculous and definitely a new record. My itinerary was super loose: I worked on music for an hour, then played a game of Binding of Isaac, then had lunch, then more music, then some game development, then another game of Binding of Isaac.

One thing I learned that long streams can *really* keep people around for the long haul. I didn't think anyone would want to sit around for more than 2 hours (my normal stream length), I think I had one or two people that sat in for at least 4 hours. I'm sure I was background noise while they worked on other things, but they were still present in chat.

Another thing I learned is that variety is *good*. I know some people go to Twitch to watch a certain game or activity, but switching from music to games to game development, I picked up people along the way in each step and not all of them dropped off when I switched to something else. Primarily I do music stuff on streams and this has encouraged me to branch out more.

I also learned that the social eating thing is *weird*, but really awesome. I was able to make a sandwich and just chill out for a half hour without stopping the stream. This was a huge boon because I'm sure that if I stopped the stream saying that ""just hang out, I'll be back"" would have caused a LOT of people to drop off. Instead, I had a really good discussion about random stuff with chat.

Another great thing I figured out was saying ""hold up, I'm going to remind Twitter that I'm still streaming"" every hour or so. Every time I did this, some of the people on my stream helped boost the signal on social media, which helped get fresh viewers in. It's totally a no pressure comment, but if the audience is enjoying themselves, it will be a no brainer.

Most importantly, I learned that *being engaging with people is infinitely more beneficial than anything else you can do*. It doesn't matter if you're a perfect musician (I sure am not), or the best Overwatch player in the world. If you suck with your audience, you won't have retention. Engage with your viewers; have conversations and respond to them!

There were multiple times during the stream where I went off on a tangent for 5-10 minutes based on what someone in chat said I barely got any work done. There was even a stretch where I pointed my camera at my piano so people could see my hands while I talked about the song I was writing. I feel like I was engaging and creating a fun place to discuss interesting ideas. This doesn't have to happen in just creative streams. Give your audience a peek ""behind the curtain"" sometimes and let them know you're a real person!

-----

In the end, I am seriously considering making every Saturday an ""all day stream"" day. I don't expect to always get the response I did today, but man it was an amazing time to have not only chat engaging with me, but chat engaging with *itself*. It happens so rarely on my streams.

Sorry if I'm gushing a bit, I'm just really excited for how much I learned today and how I'm going to apply it in the future.

If you were curious, for those who are interested in seeing the VOD from today, you can find it [here](https://www.twitch.tv/ben_burnes/v/77112851).

Do you have any other tips for creating an engaging stream? I'd love to hear what other things I can try next time I do this. Happy streaming!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4s3u50/today_was_my_best_stream_in_the_6_months_of_doing/,1468122185.0,57,0.72,13,Twitch,bFusion
4ru3n8,OBS Studio 0.15.0 now with image slideshow!,"General Changes:
* Added an image slideshow source. The image slideshow has an playlist (which you can also add directories to as well), the ability to use different types of transitions, and the ability to randomize the output

* Added a VLC video source with playlist support via libVLC. Note that this currently requires VLC to be installed on your computer (on windows, for the architecture you're using OBS with. For example, if you're using 64bit OBS Studio, you need 64bit VLC). libVLC library files will most likely end up being optionally provided by the installer in the future. This plugin works with windows and mac, and should work with linux (though hasn't had as much testing there).

* Added ""View"" menu to allow hiding parts of the user interface (just listbox toolbars, status bar, and transition pane currently)

* Added the ability to to set the scaling sampling filter for each item within a scene (point, bilinear, bicubic, and lanczos filtering). Right-click a source within a scene to set the sampling. This allows improving general source scaling quality for each item within a scene if desired (at the cost of additional fillrate).

* Added ""Scale/Aspect Ratio"" filter which can force a specific resolution or aspect ratio on a source (with a specific desired scale sampling filter).

* Added an option to automatically start recording when streaming

* Added ""Hide cursor over projector"" option to general settings

* Added the ability to delete multiple selected sources

* Changed ""Crop"" filter to ""Crop/Pad"" filter to allow it to pad in addition to crop.

* You can now add other scenes as sources within scenes. Note that it will automatically detect and prevent infinite recursion, you cannot add a scene or source if it causes infinite recursion.

* When stopping recording/streaming, it will no longer cut off video at the end. It will now stop in accordance to the timing in which you hit the button. Buttons will now say ""stopping stream"" or ""stopping recording"" while waiting for the point in which to stop the stream/recording to ensure it stops at the right timing.

* You can now specify directories with the file formatting option in advanced settings.

* Increased the maximum delay for the async delay filter to 20 seconds

* Whenever an image source gif appears on the stream/recording output, it now restarts the gif from the first frame

* Fixed another potential freeze/crash when disconnecting/reconnecting

* Fixed NVENC lossless mode, should now work as intended

* Fixed a bug where regular lossless codecs and lossless via simple output mode were only using one core

* Fixed a bug where the rate control would not be set for x264 under certain circumstances

Windows-Specific Changes:
* Fixed a bug where audio output devices wouldn't show up in the video device capture source under certain circumstances

* Fixed a bug with game capture where certain blizzard games could crash if the device was lost and reinitialized in the game

* Improved game capture capture performance for certain OpenGL games
Added process priority option to advanced settings

Linux-Specific Changes:
* Fixed the long-standing crashes with linux window capture

* Fixed a bug were window capture would not display window titles with the right text encoding

Mac-Specific Changes:
* Fixed an issue with syphon capture only capturing a portion of the target (hopefully)

4rbdnq,Guide - How to effectively post to r/twitch (kappa),"Hey Twitch Fam,


There have been a lot of great guides recently about starting out, but one topic no one has covered yet is when you should post to reddit.  This guide tackles when and what to post to reddit to make the biggest impact possible. Remember, growing your audience begins now!

&amp;nbsp;

**Before your first stream:**
There are a couple of things you need to know before you start streaming. And what better way to do that then through reddit, but it’s not that simple right? Never is. See this will be your first post, so you want to show off a bit, make people notice. To do this you need to find the best thing about your setup, and then question it. This not only gets your question answered, and also stamps your authority on the scene. A couple of starter questions for you to try out:

•	Hey guys I got a i7 6700k quad core, with a new 1080 gfx card, can I stream with this?

•	Google fiber just installed yesterday, not sure if I have the upload. Help!

&amp;nbsp;

**Day 1:**
Just finished your first stream? What are you doing reading this? Quickly start writing a recount play-by-play of how it went and about how exhilarating it was. How at first you were feeling a bit awkward like the first time you danced with a girl, but by the end it was like two bottles of jack and doing the Macarena. Actually, don’t write that. That’s my line, I’m saving it for later. Don’t tempt me, I will sue you. Write something like that, here’s some other legal dance crazes you can use: the dougie, twerking, and Gangnam style.

&amp;nbsp;

**Day 2:**
One stream down you may feel like you’re a streamer, but you’re not. We all know that no one is officially a streamer until they have completed the streamer rite of passage: create a post that ignores the hundreds of other posts asking the same question: How do I get more viewers? I’ve included some of the more personal (read: generic) answers here. Keep in mind I wrote number five especially for you.

•	Schedule

•	Time

•	Quality Content

•	Networking

•	STFU and keep streaming you poo face

&amp;nbsp;

**Day 7:**
This next stage depends on how your stream is going. 
If you ignored all of the advice you got on Day 2, and still aren’t getting views, then it’s time your cynicism and poor self-esteem to take control. Which can take two forms: the first you can complain about viewers being the worst, and them not understanding quality content when they see it – idiots. Or the more universally accepted approach, taking aim at everyone who’s more successful than you. Boobie streamers: screw em, cs go gamblers: fuck em, social eaters: hate em, pretty much everyone else: god damnit why am I so bad.

&amp;nbsp;

If, on the other hand, you ignored all of the advice you got on Day 2, and somehow managed to gain a following. Then:

1)	You’re a jerk

2)	What better way than to share it around. Let those cynical bastards know that twitch success is just around the corner, this will inspire them to greater heights! And certainly not make them feel like shit… Not in the slightest. Not at all. I mean I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. This isn’t even about me, what are you talking about. Defensive? You’re the one being defensive.

But now he has extended that harassment into my channel and my moderator's channel while we are streaming, and he's brought his friends in to help harass us too. We've banned them all but he has created fake accounts to continue to stalk/harass me and I know they have no intention of stopping.

Me and my moderators have sent several reports to twitch with evidence of this harassment but haven't heard anything yet. What else can I do to resolve this? I want my friends and I to be able to go back to enjoying Twitch again.

4qxznh,The ultimate cheatsheet for new streamers,"Hey there! Remember me? I used to post guides like these all the time back then. I'm back!

New streamers don’t have it easy. There’s just too many things to keep in mind: graphics, microphones, cameras, etc. But don’t worry, we got you covered! Here is the ultimate cheatsheet so you don't forget some of the most important tangents.

If you ever watched a successful stream, you’ll notice they contain all of the items mentioned below. This stuff will easily put your stream miles ahead and let you focus on the real thing: entertaining people and playing games!

###1. Graphic Branding

Branding is basically the process of creating a brand. In this case we’re talking about your personal brand.


Not a fancy word if you don’t like marketing, but this is a fact: branding settles an identity. I command you to open any successful stream and check their graphics. Do they share a same theme? Yes, they do.

Your brand will develop over time, so don’t worry if you’re layout is not awsome yet. Just make sure your graphics share some theme or style so they create your enviroment.

**What you’re going to do:**

* Choose your weapons (i.e Photoshop or GIMP) or find a designer.

* Create your graphics making sure they share a theme (colors, style, etc).
Easy.

 

###2. Create a Schedule

Consistence is the best word to sum it up. It’s easier to grow an audience if they can find you at the same time next week.

One of my favorite streamers, [Sirhcez](https://www.twitch.tv/sirhcez), caught my atention because he always streamed around the time I went to bed. I would let his stream run on the background and eventually fall asleep. He is not boring at all, just pretty chill and that was awsome for bedtime!

**Hear me out on this one:**

Setting up a Schedule is paramount if you’re planning to do this full-time. If I watch your stream today and it’s entertaining as hell, then I hope to find you again tomorrow! Or at least next week at the same time. Ya follow?

It doesn’t really matter how frequently you plan on streaming, this is entirely up to you. But here are the best practices:

* **Stream roughly at the same time each week.**

* **Make your live broadcast sessions at least 4 hours long.**

You may say “but hey Bastian why 4 hours, that’s too long!” It may be, but what will happen once someone goes to Facebook, finds you posted your link with a big “WATCH PLEASE” and arrives when you're offline?

**They will never come back.**

That sounds harsh, but it has been proven: if they expect something and get dissapointed, you’re done.

###3. Plan your activities

Rather than asking your new viewers and wasting a lot of valuable time, try to have things mostly planned out.

Yes, it’s ok to ask your viewers what they want, but try to **avoid delays and dead times**. No one will enjoy watching you download a 10GB game that someone suggested. No one.

So what can you do to avoid this? **Have most things planned out.**

If you have 10 games on your Steam list, then pick some options and go for that. Today you’re gonna stream Game 1 and Game 2, not all of them. Avoid switching many times (once again, delays and dead times are a no-no).

###4. Social Media

Have your social assets up and running so people can follow you from the get go. I know they can click follow or subscribe, silly! But for the most part, they will notice you’re streaming once you tweet it or state so on your social media of choice.

Consider Facebook and Twitter a Must. If your platform is not Youtube Gaming then you may also want to go for a Youtube Channel (for highlights and what not). Fill your bio, description or whatever fields needed and add graphics that also relate to your channel. Done!

You don’t need to be active on every platform, so don’t go crazy making profiles on each existing SM site.


**Some viable options, depending on your audience:**

* Tumblr
* Pinterest
* Instagram

A side story. There was a channel back then that had at least 50 images (or panels) because the guy was linking to each possible social media, from VK to Pinterest. **Why!?**

 

These is pretty much everything you should cover before you start going ham. Remember: these are important, but don’t spend weeks determining which colors to use and games to play. **This is about entertainment and the most important part is your live action!**

# Moobot

Moobot has a lot of decent features, however many of them are unusable or limited to a monthly subscription, while some features require multiple individual payments to increase the maximum number of ""slots"" within a feature. Several features aren't as expensive, most are around 50¢ to $1. However, in regards to how much is already available without paying, Moobot shows a lot of features that many other bots already have, but it is very reliable for viewer interaction, and it fulfills the basic necessities of many streamers, small and large, making it a commonly used tool across Twitch.

# Nightbot

Nightbot has a lot of features and is almost similar in comparison to Moobot, however the only difference is that Nightbot is virtually free. The bot is always being updated, there is a forum for receiving help and answers to questions, and there aren't as many bugs/issues with the bot itself in spite of it being in a beta. It has a lot of third-party integrations, including connecting to Discord servers, which I found extremely useful because I could sync all of my mods to one role in my server. Overall, Nightbot has a lot of customization with its filters and other settings. So if you're a streamer looking for a lot of customization, then try out Nightbot.

# Ohbot

Despite the lack of features it has to offer, Ohbot has a lot of third-party integrations which prove to be resourceful for looking up information for certain games. It also has some decent customization options for moderating chat as well as changing the bot's command accessibility for certain users, which can pretty much allow the streamer to limit commands to whoever they want. Ohbot also allows custom command creation and has some decent command variables to work with.

# DeepBot

DeepBot is a very exceptional Twitch bot and I use it a lot. It has a lot of features and is currently getting even more with every new update. The downside is that you need to pay $10 to get a beta license and there are some features that are exclusive to VIP users. To become VIP, users have to pay $5 a month. Fortunately, the developer gives you a free one-month VIP membership to try out the VIP features after you purchase a beta license. With VIP access, I was able to execute chat commands through voice input and make my own advanced mini-games with the VIP command variables. I also liked the Streamer Chat function, which connects all DeepBot streamers and support members for quick and easy support. I would recommend this bot to streamers who wouldn't mind paying for the bot and/or its VIP membership.

# AnkhBot

Many people argue that DeepBot's competitor when it comes to features and capabilities is AnkhBot. They have almost the same features, but there is one difference: AnkhBot is completely free. I liked the idea of being able to save user data to a Google Spreadsheet in the event of losing all of your viewers' data. ~~One downside is that AnkhBot is no longer receiving any new features, but it is still receiving bug fixes.~~ (AnkhBot was recently taken over by new developers who have revamped the bot with new features.) Nonetheless, AnkhBot is still a useful free alternative for streamers who want a bot that can do a lot.

# Vivbot

Vivbot has a lot of customizability overall, especially in terms of moderation features. One feature I found extremely interesting was that the bot could send Twitch messages to League of Legends chat. Even though the number of features may not be as impressive, Vivbot does offer some customization across certain features. Fortunately, it is being updated regularly, so there might be more features in the future, but as of now, it would seem more useful to League of Legends players.

# WizeBot

Similar to Moobot, WizeBot gives users the option to buy a currency called ""WizeGolds"", which can be used to unlock certain bot features, while other features are limited to a WizeGold Premium subscription. WizeGold's can only currently be used to give the bot a custom username for a month. Fortunately, you can now buy a one-time Premium subscription (for $78). Moving on from that, one unique thing about this bot is that it's automatically connected to the website's overlays which can be integrated into OBS, making it less of a hassle for streamers to connect a bot to overlays. It's a very easy to use bot that displays follow, sub, and donation notifications in chat and on stream because it's all connected to one source, which I found very useful. Overall, this bot would seem more beneficial to very new streamers with less than ~~150~~ 100 followers, especially since they get a premium membership and they can use the bot's overlays until they find or make their own.

# CoeBot

This bot has a lot of awesome features and some decent customization options. In spite of this, the main settings panel isn't available (yet) and the dashboard seems fairly lacking in features, which kinda shows that there is still some work to be done with the bot. However, most of CoeBot's functions are ran through commands, making it a more suitable choice for channel moderators and it has a lot of decent custom command variables as well.

# PhantomBot

PhantomBot is a very intricate bot that has a lot features with a wide range of options. It's extremely customizable and it uses cool command variables for creating custom commands. It's even capable of marking timestamps for creating future stream highlights and it works perfectly for GameWisp and TwitchAlerts notifications. Most users don't prefer PhantomBot in comparison to other bots due to the complexity of it, but many streamers don't realize all that PhantomBot can do. I love how easy it is to turn certain bot commands on and off, making it especially useful against command spammers. I also really like the fact that there are three different versions of the bot: one for people who want to try out the newest features, another for people who don't like bugs, and another for advanced users who want to implement their own features (I would highly recommend this version to advanced users). So, if you're looking for a bot that can do a lot for you, I suggest you check out PhantomBot.

# Xanbot

Xanbot is primarily a moderation bot, but it also serves as a decent loyalty bot. The bot itself can only be modified through commands which, likewise, makes it easier for the streamer and channel moderators. Xanbot is a really cool, all-around bot for all streamers with a decent number of features to offer.

# hnlBot

hnlBot currently doesn't have a lot of features, but it does have a really neat Ban Manager which logs all of the bans in chat as well as the reason, however its most notable feature is its chat client; it shows which people you're following are live, allows you to send Twitch Friend requests and connect to multiple streamers' chat channels at once, and BTTV emotes are integrated into chat. (The chat client can be used in a browser or downloaded onto your desktop as well!) This Twitch bot is still in beta, but that only means there will be more to come, so try checking out this bot for yourself.

# Ultimate Twitch Bot

For a name like ""Ultimate Twitch Bot"" and claiming to be an all-in-one streamer assistant, it doesn't have a lot of features to live up to its name. There are strictly no third-party integrations that come with this bot at all, but it does provide some customization for the features it does have. One cool thing is that it has whisper functionality, unlike most other bots. Overall, the bot wasn't too shabby, and it has a lot of basic features, but it could use a major upgrade… (or a name change.)

# DrAngryBot

I was seemingly impressed with all of the tabs prominently displaying the bots features, but when I went through each of them, I found that there wasn't a lot of customization available. There are no command variables for creating custom commands and the chat filters seemed fairly lacking in overall customization, but it's still better than nothing. The coolest and most useful feature of this bot, by far, is that viewers can connect their Twitter accounts to the bot and earn channel currency for tweeting out the streamer. The developer is also possibly looking to offer micropayments once the bot moves out of the beta phase, so I suggest giving it a try while it's still in beta.

### The following Twitch bots listed below are no longer available for use. (riPepperonis)


# BraneBot (Shutdown September 29, 2017)

It claims to be the ""Perfect Streamer Solution"" and that it is an all-in-one bot… but that's a bit of a stretch. BraneBot is rich in features overall, but those features are limited in customization. The moderation features were only limited to targeting hyperlinks and symbols. The bot itself seems more aimed towards viewers— it even gives viewers the option to pay for subscription packages for the streamer (but that would be pointless right now). However, if you want a bot with a lot of features, I highly suggest you try out BraneBot.

# RevloBot (Shutdown June 16th, 2017)

While RevloBot does not present a lot of promising features, it's primarily a loyalty bot with some decent tools for rewards and giveaways. With that said, you can make your own rewards for viewers to purchase with channel currency and it gives you a wide array of options to configure said rewards such as adding other requirements to redeem the reward. RevloBot is strictly a loyalty bot with no moderation features, so I would highly recommend it to streamers who are focused on rewarding their viewers.

*I'll be adding more Twitch bots to the list, so if you know of any working, accessible Twitch bots that aren't already on the list, message me or post it in the comments below.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4qcsfq/an_updated_twitch_bot_list/,1467160824.0,58,0.91,29,Twitch,LordNazo
4qa54r,"Twitch, why would I ever buy Cheers?","I filled out the survey already before really thinking about this so I wanted to put this here and hope that Twitch staffers maybe come across this.


I get it.  I understand that Twitch is exploring new ways to generate income for both themselves and their streamers.  They are getting creative and I don't fault them for that at all, in fact, I commend them for it.  After all, the whole point of operating a business is to provide an enjoyable service *and* generate revenue so you can continue to provide said service, and I think Twitch has done an excellent job keeping the platform accessible and balanced.  

That said, here's my problem with cheers; I have no incentive to buy them.  The target demographic of people who are going to spend money on cheers is roughly the same demographic as people (like me) who donate to their favorite streamers.  When I donate to a stream big or small, partnered or non-partnered, I get: an audio notification, a visual notification, sometimes a funny animation, a personal thank you from the streamer.  When I buy bits I get: an animated emote in chat.  Some streamers have enabled notifications for when bits or ""cheers"" are dropped in chat, so then I get my audio/visual notifications and the 'thank you' from the streamer, but the impact is far less than if I were to donate.  As an example, I saw this happen several times yesterday: Someone bought bits and dropped them in chat with a message.  The streamer had a notification on, and thanked the person, but the message they typed along with their cheers got buried in chat by emote spam from a new subscriber.  Their message was off the screen before the streamer could even look over.  That person spent $7, wrote out a message, only to have it go completely unnoticed.   Then there's the whole mess about how that money is paid out.  With a donation the streamer can sometimes get 100% of the donation.  Some donation setups have an option that calculates the fee on a donation and adds that amount to your donation so you can ensure that they are getting the full $5 or whatever, which I like, because I want to feel like I am helping them out instead of complicating their finances.  The bit/cheer system takes a cut of the money so if I go this route I'm not even sure how much money I'm sending to support my favorite streamers.


TL;DR: dollar for dollar, donating provides better value

**Edit:** I want to clarify, that I don't see Cheers or Bits as an inherently *bad* idea.  Like I said, I like that they are trying to innovate and explore new options to grow their business while making it interactive with the community.  My main point in this was that the way it was rolled out made it appear like an inferior version of donations.  It wasn't clear to me that it was a beta because [their official blog announcement video](https://blog.twitch.tv/introducing-cheering-celebrate-together-da62af41fac6#.s83r0fqwa) didn't make it very clear that it was still in development.  You could also tell they didn't spend much time prepping some of their streamers on how to set it up, or how to message it so initially it seemed like it premiered with a fizzle instead of a bang.  Several points that have been brought up in this thread have actually opened my eyes as to the benefit of this system though, and I'm actually going to start participating and see what it's like.


**Edit #2:**  Thanks to most of you for actually having an open and honest dialogue and not just jumping on the hate bandwagon because change is scary.

This just fortifies the disadvantages of small streamers, those who may actually have real value out of cheering instead of the ""riches getting richer"" snowball type of thing that is already too prelevent on Twitch. With the way streams are presented, the very poor 50% cut deals the small streamers get versus the far superior deals the larger ones have and the ""I can do what I want and have to fear no consequences"" thing that is going on with any larger streamer that makes Twitch money.

Note, im not a streamer im just posting this information from what i keep hearing.  This isnt officially confirmed but the numbers do add up if real.

A few people have been doing the maths in various streams and have worked out how much twitch takes from cheers. Apparently, twitch takes 29% from the 100 bits, 26% or so for 500, 24% for 1500, 22% for 5000, 21% for 10000, 19% for 25000, very rough numbers but that's about it

So at $308 donated the streamer gets $250

Compare this to Paypal is 2.9% + $0.30 from paypal (edited thanks to a comment )

____
100 bits = $1.40
500 bits = $7
1500 bits = $19.95
5000 bits = $64.40
10000 bits = $126

4poxkc,"Two Years Streaming, Four Years Viewing/Modding on Twitch - Reflection and Advice","Hello /r/Twitch.

My name is GamrEnchantment and I am an avid user on Twitch, as a broadcaster, moderator, subreddit user, helper and as always, a viewer and member of the community. I have been an active participant on the subreddit for over a year and have tried to help or guide people that post on the forum in that amount of time. Just last month, I celebrated my 2 years streaming on Twitch and have been reflecting back on my experiences, from the moment I decided to push “Start Stream” to when I decided to do the one-year Twitch challenge (Day 117 as of today!).

The purpose of this post is to reflect on those years of streaming and giving my experience and knowledge I have accumulated over that time. But, I wanted to do more than give my take as a broadcaster. I have been an active viewer and moderator on Twitch for over 4 years and not many people talk about their experience and what they have learned as a viewer, moderator, or member of the Twitch community and family. Therefore, as a forewarning, this will be a lengthy post and I will provide a TL;DR at the end. (But you know you want to read it, since you have the time in your day to browse Reddit and all. Kappa )

*******************************
**2 years streaming on Twitch**

**Starting Out**

Although I had dabbed in a little streaming from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2’s YouTube streaming migration of the game, I hadn’t really considered streaming. I mainly did some YouTube videos, but the amount of time it took was more than I had time to dedicate (was finishing up my bachelors in computer science). After having watched a few Twitch channels and moderated for a year years, I decided to take my chances on streaming.

My first mistakes were not understanding all the equipment I needed to really take broadcasting seriously. I figured “hey, just push the button and magic will happen.” I was plagued with audio issues, major lag from trying to upload at near ISP upload speed, and I had no idea how to organize my stream. My original equipment was the Roxio Game Capture HD, an ASUS U46E laptop, GAEMS PGE Sentry and my Xbox 360. I relied heavily on the Roxio to stream, as I knew of no other software to use. I used no webcam and if I decided to talk during the stream, it was either my laptop mic or my TurtleBeach MW3 headset that I jimmy-rigged the wires between my Xbox 360 controller and laptop. I still own all this equipment (except the headset) as a back-up, but it has very much been retired.

When I first started streaming, I had zero idea what to stream. That is understandable when you first start streaming. What will people watch? What is most interesting? The better question is what do YOU want to play? Streaming is all about having fun and enjoying what you are playing while live. I jumped between Diablo 3, Borderlands 2, and Call of Duty: Ghosts and Black Ops 2. They were games I enjoyed and didn’t mind sharing my interest in them.

My advice to those that are starting off, DO RESEARCH. This subreddit is the perfect place to find all the information you need to know about getting started. While it may seem easy to just make a post saying “New to Twitch, how do I stream?”, browse through this forum and there will some kind of post that will answer your every question. If there isn’t one, help.twitch.tv is your next best place. It is crafted to help any streamer of any size. As well, think small. You may stop by Kreyg or Wyld or TheHaleyBaby’s channels and say “I can do that. I can be like them in just a few months.” While it may be possible to be the next FuturemanGaming or General_Mittenz, start small and think small. Expect your first few weeks to have a few viewers, but mainly yourself. Don’t be discouraged by it and don’t let it prevent you from streaming. It takes time to grow. Above all, do it for the fun. Stream because you want to stream and you are having fun. While the idea of having itsHafu or Lirik’s viewer count is ultimate Kreygasm, it won’t happen overnight. Stream because you want to and it is fun for you to play games and entertain those that drop by.

*******************************
**First 6 months**

After your first few months of streaming, it gets easier, as long as you put in the effort for your channel. By this point, I was really getting into streaming and the next big piece of advice I was given was to set a schedule of when I stream. This would make it so that viewers knew when I would go live. A key to success as a streamer is a solid schedule, but we all know that real life is a troll and likes to get in the way. It is understandable and if you can, plan for it in your schedule. If you can’t, use the channel feed or social media to let your followers know if the schedule is changing a little bit. Trying to keep to a schedule can be rough, but it also helps you focus on your channel and content.

After trying different games and watching other streamers, I came to a crossroads, do I go with variety or a specific game/genre? This is a tough choice to make and not easy by any means. I have heard some streamers say that doing a specific game or genre helps you grow faster in the beginning, then branch to variety. Personally, I see a few flaws in that logic.

If you stick to a specific game or genre, your viewers and followers will begin to only want that content from you, as a broadcaster. If you decide to “change it up” one day, your viewership can drop-off and it could suffer. While variety may mean slow growth in the beginning, it means that the regulars that you do get are there for not only the content, but to see the broadcaster as well. It is slow growth, but allows you to broaden what you stream and try new things.

After several months, I began to realize that when I got a follower or a donation or a raid/host, I just thanked those people, but it wasn’t anything special. Most streamers have that catch phrase or line that is said when they get a follower or donation. It takes time and sometimes, it just happens, if you want it to happen. Since my name is GamrEnchantment, I just started saying “Thank you X for the follow, welcome to the land of enchantment and fantasy, where all your dreams can come true, as long as you don’t make the unicorns cry.” I thought it was fitting and people liked it. After a while, I was asked where my unicorns were, since I would say don’t make them cry. That led me to purchasing a stuffed unicorn and letting the chat name it (not always a good idea) and Moxxi the Unicorn was born. While this may come up out of the blue or you want to create it before your first stream, personas and props can become part of the stream and culture of your channel. You don’t need to have a persona or character for your channel or props, but if it is something you want to do, start on it early and try it out. If viewers like it, they will let you know. It is your channel and you way to be creative with it.

As your channel begins to grow, you start to pay more attention to the chat and what people are saying in it. There may come a time when you will consider getting a moderator and/or moderator bot to help with your chat. These are choices you have to make and how you make them is completely up to you. If you are looking for a moderator, find someone that understands not only your channel, but your community and what you expect of the chat. Someone that is available when you are live and understands the ins and outs of Twitch moderation. Personally, when looking for a mod, I want someone that understands the Twitch Terms of Service, and Rules of Conduct, as those are something every person on Twitch agreed to when they made an account. Past that, that person understands the rules of my chat and I can trust them to handle situations without me stopping to handle the chat myself during a stream. Everyone has a different expectation of their mods and that is something you need to figure out for your channel. But, in the beginning, setting up a moderation bot like Nightbot or Moobot helps. These are common moderating bots available to everyone. There are others available (e.g., Xanbot, Anhkbot, Deepbot) and they may require more attention or programming to get setup correctly. Everyone has a preferred bot to use in their channel and it is recommended you research them before picking one for your channel. And please, take time to program the bot for your channel, preferably before streaming.

*******************************
**First year**

It has been a year of streaming and amazing things have happened. I had my first charity stream, my first extended stream (36 hours for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare launch) and I was on Twitch Weekly as the Broadcaster Spotlight in January 2015. It has been an amazing experience and the channel is growing, along with my interests and ideas. I started to invest more money in better equipment, more games, and planning my first con to attend (TwitchCon 2015). By this point, I had a good idea of where the channel was going, but I was still exploring new ideas like graphic designs, overlays, content, and how all of it would tie together. With equipment, I was finally able to upgrade from a Blue Snowball to a Blue Yeti and got a pop filter and Microphone boom stand for it. I also got better headphones, a 3rd monitor, and a tablet to read the chat from. I also looked at new software and bots to see if it would help the channel. While I was mainly a Call of Duty and Minecraft streamer, I was starting to get bored and frustrated with COD and Minecraft was having issues with my computer or vice versa. This led to content changing and that is always a difficulty and challenge. Changing channel content can make some viewers leave, but new ones arrive as well. I also started to do certain games on specific days so people interested in that game could show up on those days (e.g., Quiplash on Sundays). This helps with the scheduling and when doing variety, it gives the viewers an idea of what day to show up, if they like that certain game/genre.

**Second Year**

I finally hit 2 years streaming on Twitch and it has been an experience of networking, channel upgrades, and revamps after revamps. I have networked with so many streamers, both partnered and non-partnered. I have joined some esports organizations and twitch stream teams and all have helped me get to know more and more broadcasters like myself. I have upgraded some equipment, but mostly still using stuff I have had for over a year. I am still a variety streamer, but I have started to reduce the amount of games I play and more stick to 2 or 3 genres of games. The biggest part for me now is continuing to grow the channel and provide better content for my viewers and being there when scheduled and making my channel a safe, welcoming, enchanting place to be.

*******************************
**Networking**

&gt; “It’s about what you can do for them. Not what they can do for you.”

This is a phrase lots of people hear when it comes to networking and connecting with people in any industry. The statement is very true to its words. When you meet someone in your industry that is bigger and more successful than you, don’t go to them with the attitude of “this person can help me grow if they shout me out or mention me.” The correct attitude to have is “I wonder if I can help to add something to their community and channel that isn’t there already or help improve it.” Be genuine when you network and offer to help them out. They may not need the help, but they will remember that you offered and if something comes up, perhaps they will ask you for that help. When you network, make it about their channel and content and ask about how they were able to do it. Get to know them and their channel. You can learn something from their experiences and apply it to your own. Offer to exchange cards and check out their channel (if you haven’t already). The biggest thing is to make an impression without coming off as wanting it to be about you. While some partners will say to stick to streamers your size to grow, look at bigger streamers as well. While talking to other broadcasters that are between 1000 and 2000 followers will find me potential co-streaming opportunities, talking to the bigger streamers offer advice and knowledge that smaller streamers, like myself, haven’t gotten or seen yet. Talking to Spamfish on Thursday night at TwitchCon 2015, I asked him what was a big difficulty he had starting out and it was not looking at the numbers. I could associate with that and hearing that helped reaffirm what I had been trying to do. I wasn’t concerned with him shouting me out or giving me advice on how to grow my channel. I wanted to know about his channel and what he has experienced. I wanted to learn this and see how he handled situations that perhaps I had or had not experienced yet.

**Teams**

You may see some team names next to broadcasters are or are not on a professional esports team. These are Twitch stream teams and they are a great way to not only network with other streamers, but for viewers to watch streamers on their favorite team. These teams are run by either esports teams (Denial, Enigma Esports, CLG) or partners and staff that wanted to round up like-minded streamers and have a community where they could offer an experience to the viewer (Reject Gaming, The Hammer Squad, The 42nd). For all the teams, you must be invited by the team creator and each team has a process to be invited to that team. If you are interested in a team, reach out to the owner and see what you have to do to be invited.

**Conventions**

*networking, Networking, NETWORKING.* Although conventions are an amazing place to be and you want to explore everything and buy all the things, it is also the place to network. It gives you a chance to talking to other Twitch streamers, partners, staff members, and even gaming companies. Referring back to the main part about networking, ask questions, learn more, and try to offer help.

Make sure to have business cards with you when attending events. This is the best way to get your information to someone and not take up another person’s time. A good tip is to strike up a conversation about something that person is doing and ask for their business card to follow-up. When they give you a card, hand them your card. If they don’t have a card, pull one of yours out and write their e-mail on the back of it. Then, a few days after the event, send that person an e-mail, say you want to follow up on your conversation and go from there. Make it about them and what you could offer to help them.

*******************************
**4 years as a viewer and moderator**

Before I started streaming, I was a viewer and a moderator for many channels on Twitch. I am still a viewer and do some moderating, but I have learned many things over the years about being a viewer and moderator that I wanted to share as well. Many posts just talk about advice for being a streamer or a moderator, but there is not much out there about being a viewer of a channel and you would be surprised how many people don’t understand “basics” about being a viewer or a moderator.

You may not know it, but you don’t need to donate or subscribe to be a supporter of a channel on Twitch. Just opening up your favorite streamer and leaving the channel open supports that broadcaster. When I am working or doing school work or even around the house, I always have someone’s stream open on my computer. That is because I want to support broadcasters by giving them that view and attention.

Now, there is a difference between being active and lurking in a channel. Being active is just that, you are active in the channel. You are there, watching, typing in the chat, and being interactive with the broadcaster, mods, and other viewers. Lurking is just leaving a channel open or watching a channel, but not interacting. By leaving a channel open and walking away, I am lurking, but still supporting that broadcaster. Now, everyone has different internet connections, bandwidth, and other situations that may not allow you to do that. But, just having a few channels open while working at the office or doing school work, even if you mute the stream, helps and supports that broadcaster.

As a moderator, you should be expected to be active in that channel in whatever manner is expected from that broadcaster. If you are going to go AFK or lurk for a little while, let the broadcaster know in a whisper or some private message. DO NOT tell the broadcaster you are going AFK in the channel chat. That is asking for lots of bad things and may even lead to removal of mod status, depending on the broadcaster.

The next thing for supporting a broadcaster is donations or tips and subscriptions (for partners). Never feel like you HAVE to donate or subscribe to a broadcaster. There are many broadcasters I watch that I have not tipped or subbed to, but I make a point to always be there and be active in their channel in some way. It is your choice whether you decide to tip or sub to a broadcaster and never feel like it is a 100% thing you must do in order to support that broadcaster.

**Rules of a channel**

Always, ALWAYS remember that when you signed up for a Twitch ID, you agreed to the Twitch Terms of Service (ToS) and Rules of Conduct (RoC). Violation of those rules can result in a broadcaster or mod timing you out, banning you, or submitting a report you have you perma-banned from Twitch. It is the right of a broadcaster, mod, and viewer to abide by these rules. Now, broadcasters normally set-up rules for their channel that co-inside with the Twitch ToS and RoC, but that doesn’t mean the channel rules supersede the Twitch ToS and RoC. Just remember to play nice, be excellent to each other, and party on (dudes).

**Chat**

After talking about the rules of a channel, always remember “if you wouldn’t say it to their face, don’t say it in chat.” Just because you are hiding behind a keyboard and monitor, that doesn’t give you the right to be a douche canoe.

Be active with other viewers, not just the broadcaster. It is about the community in each channel and in Twitch. Talk to other viewers and the mods. Get to know the community. Don’t spend the whole streaming trying to talk to the broadcaster and taking their attention for yours only.

Respect the Mod(s). This cannot be stressed enough. People with the green sword have been given it for a reason. If you don’t understand something with the chat or are having an issue with someone else in the chat, let a moderator know. That is what they are there for. If you have a question, ask respectfully and wait for an answer. 

DO NOT:

* Don’t ask why the caster only has X viewers. It is rude, inconsiderate, and brings unwanted attention to the broadcaster. 
* DO NOT SELF PROMOTE OR PROMOTE OTHERS. If you want to promote something, ask first. Most channels insta-ban people that self-promote or promote others. This includes, but is not limited to saying:
* “Hey, my channel is &lt;channel&gt;. Can you check it out please?”
* “My friend &lt;name&gt; streams too. You should check out his channel.”
* “My favorite streamer X has come on. I gotta go.”
* “I want to start a Twitch/YouTube channel. What should I do?”
* Post links without permission. Normally, links are blocked in many chats, so don’t. If the broadcaster has a way for you to post links (Ex: song requests), follow the channel rules.

**Moderator**

If you have been picked to be a moderator in a channel, always remember that is given, not earned or privileged. Moderators are held to a higher standard than your average viewer because of their administrative powers within that channel. Familiarize yourself with the Twitch ToS and RoC, along with the channel’s rules. Those are what you will use to handle situations within that channel. If you moderate in multiple channels, always remember what is OK in one channel may not be acceptable in another. Always ask the broadcaster if you have questions, concerns, or in need of clarification.

When you are moderating a channel, moderate the channel, not be the authority over the channel. The broadcaster is the authority over the channel and you are assisting the broadcaster to have an awesome, tight-knit community. Don’t feel like because you have a sword you have rule over the chat. Always remember, you can lose that sword just as fast are you were given it. This being said, know how and when to moderate a channel. If you have questions, talk to the broadcaster and other mods OFFLINE about it. Never discuss moderation of a channel when the broadcaster is live, unless absolutely needed.

*******************************
**TL;DR**

Starting Streaming:

* Research. Look at the subreddit. Watch other channels, use help.twitch.tv, they all help in some way.

First six months:

* Start thinking about what direction you want to go. Variety vs. Game/Genre Specific.

First Year:

* Expand your channel content. New graphics, new logos, new games, new equipment. Keep it fresh. Look into promotional venues (e.g., Twitch Weekly)

Second Year: 

* Always look for ways to upgrade your channel and keep interest of your community. Never stop researching.

Networking:

* “It’s about what you can do for them. Not what they can do for you.”
* Conventions = Networking. Have business cards when attending events.

4 years as a viewer and moderator:

* Watching a stream or leaving a channel open on your browser is supporting the broadcaster. You don't need to donate or subscribe to support.

Rules of a channel:

* Remember, Twitch ToS and RoC come first. Then, the channel's rules.

Chat:

* If you wouldn’t say it to their face, don’t say it in chat.
* Do Nots: Ask why the broadcaster has X viewers, Self-Promote or Promote others, mention another broadcaster is on and you are leaving, ask how to start a Twitch channel when the broadcaster is streaming.

Moderator:

* It is a right, not a privilege. Moderate the channel, don't control it.
* If you are a mod, be active. If you have to lurk or go AFK, tell the broadcaster privately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4poxkc/two_years_streaming_four_years_viewingmodding_on/,1466798819.0,81,0.88,34,Twitch,GamrEnchantment
4pnwde,Twitch streams stuttering on Chromecast today,"I'm noticing the vast majority of streams I try to cast to my Chromecast are choppy and stuttering today. I checked my internet, everything is normal. The streams play just fine on source quality on my tablet, but when I send it over to the CC, the video stutters and audio plays normally, or in the case of Seagull's stream, both audio and video are choppy. Normally I have no problem watching Seagull or MOONMOON, but neither of these streams wants to play on my Chromecast today without issues...

All the streams I have tried are partnered so the quality should auto adjust if my internet couldn't handle it (which doesn't seem to be the case, since they all work on my tablet).

I've tried rebooting the Chromecast, but that didn't fix anything. Anyone else experiencing this?

**Update:** I finally emailed Twitch regarding the issue since its been several days now and nothing has changed. With multiple others here experiencing the same issue as well as some folks on Twitter posting about it, its safe to say the problem isnt my Chromecast malfunctioning. Also for people posting about issues watching in browsers, this thread is NOT about that at all. This is about Chromecast. If you don't know what that is, Google it.

**Update #2 (8/12/16):** It's now been a month and a half since I made this thread. The problem is still there. Twitch hasnt even acknowledged it. I grudgingly broke down and bought a FireTV stick. The Twitch app on it works great. You can actually select the quality. Sorry guys, I tried to get Twitch's attention on this issue but they just keep turning a blind eye. I've sent in 3 emails/bug reports and heard nothing back. I've tweeted @twitchsupport countless times to no avail. Just searching ""twitch chromecast"" on twitter returns many tweets of frustrated users experiencing the same thing, and no one cares. At one point I thought I had u/filmsushi 's ear on the subject but apparently not. I'm washing my hands of this frustrating issue and I'm going to try and enjoy this Firetv stick. Best of luck to anyone still trying to get the Twitch dev's attention.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4pnwde/twitch_streams_stuttering_on_chromecast_today/,1466787162.0,113,0.99,112,Twitch,Blindjanitor

4pd90i,A Look at Income From Twitch/YouTube and Why I'm Not Full-Time,"[Link to my previous post, A Case Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4csbhp/ive_found_success_on_twitch_by_streaming_a_mobile/)

&lt;edit&gt;

I've gotten a lot of concern about whether or not you're even contractually allowed as a Twitch Partner or YouTube partner to disclose how much I make from ads. I've emailed both YouTube partnership and Twitch Partnership and they've both said that it's perfectly allowed and that there is nothing in our contracts that prevents me from sharing revenue or analytics.

&lt;/edit&gt;

**Where Are We Now?**

Recently, I've had a few conversations with friends of mine who are looking to get into streaming, or who want to do streaming to make some extra money on the side. I've always been pretty transparent with my viewers about numbers especially how much I make off of ads, and why I haven't made the leap from streaming as a hobby to streaming as a full-time job. Today is **June 22nd, 2016** and right now on Twitch we have **16,700** followers, **125** subscribers, **345,000** channel views, and an average of **300+** viewers when streaming One Piece Treasure Cruise, and **100+** when streaming any other game. Obviously, our growth over the past 3 months ago has slowed down significantly on Twitch [compared to the previous year](http://zeenigami.com/my-road-to-success-a-case-study/). However, while our average concurrent viewers has not grown, the number of viewers who will remain and watch while we stream a variety game has grown which has me very optimistic.

Via http://www.twinge.tv/zeenigami/growth/#/90

On YouTube we're doing quite well, and our viewer base is growing at a steady rate. We've now got **25,500** subscribers, with **6,800,000** views and **31,400,000** minutes watched on our videos. That's a 25% increase in the number of subscribers and a 50% increase in the number of views and minutes watched!

**The Numbers $$$**

Something a lot of people are very weary of showing is how much money they make from ads, donations, subscriptions, etc. I suppose it could be because it's seen as rude to discuss income in many western cultures, making people feel uncomfortable about an inequality in wages. I've also heard from others they they don't like sharing revenue because it helps give the content creator leverage when negotiating potential partnerships and deals. I can certainly relate to the latter, especially in ""real"" job interviews where your perceived value to an employer is the difference between getting a job or not, but I've never really felt any shame about sharing revenue related to ads or subscriptions.

Via YouTube's Analytics Dashboard for last 365 days

As you can see, I've earned an average of $10/day just from **YouTube** ads. If you're unfamiliar with the way ad revenue works, something we must talk about is **CPM**. CPM is the cost of a thousand ad impressions for the advertiser to pay when their ad is displayed. The actual number for your CPM can vary greatly due to many different factors including the engagement rate of the viewers, as well as the demographics of the viewers. If you're interested in learning more about CPM [Hank Green of the Vlog Brothers](https://medium.com/@hankgreen/the-1-000-cpm-f92717506a4b#.volv6mjzv) has a great post about it in relation to YouTubers.

While getting** $10/day** seems incredibly low to live off of (and it is) that's not all of my income from content creation. I only run ads at the end of a Twitch stream right before logging off, or very rarely if I have to take a break and walk away from the computer. There are still ads that run when people first tune into the stream, but many viewers will have adblock turned on which as we discussed earlier will affect our CPM and how much income we get from ads. Even so, from Twitch ads I average about **$3/day**. However, on **Twitch** a majority of my income will come from Twitch subscribers.

http://imgur.com/mSpIJ7d
From Twitch Revenue Dashboard

As stated earlier, I'm currently at **125** subscribers and while a monthly subscription on Twitch costs $5 per month, most channels will only get about 50% of that. Larger channels or channels that have been around for a long time may have different rates, and there are even channels such as Jesse Cox's Twitch stream who have a 1-time payment. Most channels you won't be able to tell exactly how many subscribers they have, but if you take a peek at their emotes you have a good idea of what their highest subscriber count was.

[On Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Zeenigami?ty=h), I get 90% of the money pledged and it allows for much more flexible contributions. I'm currently not pushing Patreon very hard, and most viewers will subscribe over Twitch for the added benefits of getting access to Twitch emotes. Right now, we have **$160 per month** pledged on Patreon.

**Reflections**

I am still a relative newcomer to the Twitch / YouTube scene. The community I've built is still small, but it's growing and there are many absolutely AMAZING viewers who have been with us for ages. My schedule right now is still the same it was on my last post. 8 hour work days, 4 hours of streaming, 2 hours of editing videos, and barely any sleep. I've always been pretty pragmatic about life, and at my day job I am making in a week what I'd make from a full month of Twitch and YouTube. While quitting my job would give me more time and energy to focus on content creation and certainly help me grow exponentially, the income from ads is quite low, donations can vary from month to month, and subscriptions are the only source of stable income.

When looking at blog posts and stories about how much someone is making from ad revenue especially, pay close attention to the date of the information. Recently, the ecosystem around ads and ad revenue has changed dramatically and the amount of money even incredibly successful content creators are getting from ads is not the same as they used to be. I don't have a set goal in mind for if or when I'll make a jump to content creation full-time. While it's a wonderful dream, I have many reservations about leaving my job and jumping in with both feet, but one day maybe the time will be right for me, and at that time I'd love to see you all chatting along with me on Twitch and watching reviews, let's plays, and guides on YouTube.

TL;DR: Please read the numbers if you're interested, anything you may want to know is probably bolded.

4p7l3s,"PSA: If You Can, Host Someone, Preferably Someone Who's Putting the Effort... Also, Tips for New Streamers","Sometimes there's people out there who are working hard to make it but aren't getting any attention. As a new streamer, you have to choose your games wisely so you can increase your chances at exposure. When I get enough viewers and plan on ending the stream, I tend to host someone who is putting in the effort but can't seem to catch a break. Remember your viewers are there for you and the content. Try to host someone who is playing the same game as you were. This will increase the chances the viewer will stick around and get to know the streamer.  
  
Tips For New Streamers:
  
* Put effort into your channel, replace your avatar, put up a banner, add panels, etc.
* Add some overlay and bots to your stream if you wish.
* A camera is not required but it helps, however, a mic is a must.
* Always talk, even if no one is watching (playing with friends will make this easier - Thanks, ZZeyak)
* Be consistent and dedicated, this is very important! Have a schedule, stick to it and try to be on as much as possible. This will determine whether or not streaming is for you.
* Use social media like twitter, use #hashtags that will help you gain exposure like: #supportsmallstreams. There are also accounts out there that are dedicated to helping streamers by retweeting your tweet when they're mentioned. The end result: I'm going live with #Overwatch @twitterhandlehere #supportsmallstreams. Don't go crazy with the hashtags and mentions though...
* Join a community that is dedicated to helping each other out. There are communities out there that are made up of streamers and viewers. Also, apply for Stream Teams when you can, some don't require a sub button.  
  
The point is to show you're putting the effort. If you're being hosted, take advantage and engage with the chat as much as possible, let your personality out. Sometimes chat can become overwhelming to the point where you forget what you're doing while playing. Remember that you can't please everyone, so stay motivated and, as always, be yourself. Twitch is growing quickly and just about anyone can stream now and days.  
  
Hosting is a bliss for both parties, but lets share that moment with someone who will cherish it. Now go out there and make someone's day!

Not only that but today, a streamer with 30k viewers had a homophobic remark and a racial slur played via one of those auto play YouTube programs where people can donate to have a video auto played.

4owsqp,PSA - German Report Brigades are a thing,"**TL;DR version:** If you find yourself chatting with a random group of viewers who want you to watch a couple of videos from a German YouTuber, delete the links, ban them, and report them for harassment.

**EDIT:** Two new pieces of info! My suspension was technically unrelated to the Germans, per the rules of the subreddit I can't disclose it unfortunately, but I will say that it was a combination of my own absent-mindedness and poor timing, and most folks will be mindful enough to never run up against this problem. That's part one. Part two is that I would encourage streamers to continue to follow my TL;DR, and I hope Twitch continues to monitor this activity; I've since received more information on these people and they're actively attempting to recruit people to harass and bully the aforementioned German YouTuber, and I know that Twitch has no love for bullies. Major props to the Twitch staff in this sub for their help in getting this sorted out, and thanks to you guys for providing additional information and just generally being a helpful community. 

---------

Hey folks, not going to mention my channel per the rules, and while there is a suspension that resulted from this, it's not the focus so I hope the mods will allow this to stay.

I run a relatively small channel that averages less than 20 viewers per stream, and am a few days into a 365 day challenge, which tends to attract interest of both the positive and negative kind, so when about 7 or 8 German viewers showed up and started greeting me, I assumed it was the former and welcomed them to my stream.

This was a mistake.

They encouraged me to watch a couple of videos on YouTube, so I confirmed with my moderators that there was no explicit content in said videos and then proceeded to play them. They were pretty funny, just a very triggered dude ranting in German, and none of the content was anything you'd worry about showing on stream, no dicks, no actual violence, y'know.

An hour later, my account was suspended. Upon reviewing my chat logs, once I was no longer willing to watch further videos, they moved on to another channel to target, presumably mass-reporting me as a group. I checked the vod for the stream they migrated to, and they tried to pull the same shit with him, but he was smart enough to send them packing.

I do have evidence for all of this, so if anyone knows how I can make Twitch aware of it please let me know. Mods, if you'd like to see the evidence, just message me. Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Cheers friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4owsqp/psa_german_report_brigades_are_a_thing/,1466394170.0,67,0.88,27,Twitch,figgz

4ol6t7,"[Twitch Blog PSA] On Artificial Viewers, Followers, and Chat Activity","&gt; We at Twitch are well aware that view-bots, follow-bots, and chat-impersonation bots are a persistent frustration. Exploited by a small minority, these services have created a very real problem that has damaging effects across our entire community.
For those unaware, these bots are used to artificially inflate the apparent view count, follower count, and chat activity on a Twitch channel.

&gt; Sometimes these bots are used by a broadcaster who believes the perception of higher viewership and social activity will put them on the fast-track to success or Twitch partnership. Other times, bots are used to harass other broadcasters in order to attempt to deny them partnership, or get their channel suspended. All of this is enabled by bot services offered by a handful of sellers who make misleading claims for their own commercial benefit. We take this situation very seriously and would like you to know what we’re doing about it.

&gt; First, we employ a range of technological solutions to detect false viewers and remove them. This is an ongoing effort that requires regular maintenance and engineering, and one we’re dedicated to continuing and making even more effective.

&gt; Second, our moderation, support, and partnerships teams regularly investigate reports of artificially inflated viewer and follower counts, as well as fake chat activity, and respond to them on a case-by-case basis.

&gt; Today we are adding a third layer. We are taking the next step toward protecting Twitch viewers and broadcasters from the damaging effects of this kind of malicious activity by taking public legal action against seven of the most active sellers of viewbot services. [See here](http://cl.ly/013D2U0t2U0C) for the full text of the public legal complaint.

&gt; Ultimately though, the best way to stop viewbot sellers from profiting off of empty promises is to not buy their services. Using viewbots hurts anyone using them on their own channel or found to be using them against other channels, as well as the Twitch community at large.

4ojzew,Don't become friends with big streamers just to get more followers,"I've seen a lot of posts on this site suggesting that you befriend those with bigger channels so you can get more followers and views, but honestly, I find this to be very heartless and douchey. Don't become friends with another streamer so they'll raid you and boost up your channel, be friends with streamers for the reason people befriend those in their life. Becoming friends with a big streamer should just be something you do without expecting anything else.

4ogkgp,Hard truths struggling streamers need to hear and how to grow your channel,"Hi, I've helped alot of streamers turn their hobby into a career and I'm tired of seeing the same questions over and over on this sub. So this is what works:

-Play games in the 'middle'. Not top 10 games or you'll drown in a sea of other streamers, not anything too obscure or you wont have any visibility. Id say anything below the top 15 games probably.

-Have good quality, and a high interactivity stream.

-Try to do something unique with your channel.

-Stream to your strengths: are you funny? Are you good looking? Skilled?

-Dont go mental with overlays.

-Get to know the twitch community. Hang out in channels and host other streamers when you're done. A bigger streamer giving you support can give a big boost to your channel.
Pick a good title for each stream to catch peoples attention. (This can make a bigger difference then you think)

-A sneaky one is allow song request (and put it in your title) but make it so you have to follow to use it. You'll get alot of trolls but some will stick around.

-Oh, and a consistant schedule.

Hate to say it but when you see posts of people saying they've streamed for a year and have a couple hundred followers, you take a look at their stream and its just straight up bad. Theres countless streams like this.

There isn't a 'secret key' that everyone seems to be searching for.

What most of the streamers that have bad progress need to do (which they obviously dont) is watch their past broadcasts.

Put aside their egos and what they think is funny or skillful and think ""would i bother dedicating time to watching this"".. And make changes. Be self critical! Nobody wants to see you engrossed in teamspeak just dicking around in minecraft. Put on a godamn show, because chances are you aren't as funny as you think you are.

Also on this sub's community - it amazes me that anything that is a success story is down voted and anything where someone is getting slow progess is highly upvoted. People want to feel like they're doing well.

The amount of posts where people are straight up furious about what other channels are doing are stupid. Like they're stealing viewers from their own channel. If you used that energy on your own stream, you wouldn't be so salty and you'd find more success in your stream.

Thats the reason I'm not posting my Twitch channel here, because last time it drew alot of trolls and angry people to my stream. Very disappointing.

Its not a matter of visibility if your stream isn't growing, it means that your stream isn't good. But you CAN fix it.

Everyone expects it to be easy because the end game is 'the dream job'.





Edit:

Sorry I'm not going to give out any channel names but I'll just tell you what I consider a ""career"" and some specifics of my channel.

The first 3 months was a bit rocky as I had just discovered Twitch and working out the technical side was rather challenging.

After some money started coming in and it became apparent that this could be an opportunity, more time and money was invested back into the stream and quality/consistancy improved drastically.

I put a huge amount of focus into researching all the points I have listed here and have experimented with every one of them extensively, these are my results.

The channel is my sole source of income and revenue exceeded $20k in the first year of streaming. I know money is something people don't like to focus on here but the viewers and subscribers are well aware that this is my ""job"". 

They are happy to support the channel and for that I try to provide the best possible show.

The channel is by no means a top 20 or even top 100 channel but I consider any channel that allows the owner to live off of to be a success. Channel has been active for about 15 months and is averaging about 1.5k followers a month and about $200 per day. Our personal channels key focus is interactivity and community because I'm not very good at gaming and not overy funny; an example of playing to your strengths and not being too proud to know admit your weaknesses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4ogkgp/hard_truths_struggling_streamers_need_to_hear_and/,1466122805.0,59,0.87,34,Twitch,Twitch_Advisor

4o4e5j,A handful of free tools for streaming on Twitch,"[Link to the article](http://www.davevoyles.com/handful-free-useful-tools-streaming-twitch/)

In the last few months I decided to start streaming the games I’m playing, podcasts I record, and programming tutorials that I create. I use OBS (Open Broadcast Software) for all of this, which is a free tool for recording and streaming audio and video from your computer. I created a video tutorial around this as well. (in the linked article, as I obviously can't post a video in here).

**Discord Chat Overlay**

Discord Overlay Host application so that I could capture my voice chat to OBS while I stream to Twitch, and still be able to use the desktop application for responding to text chat. This application allows you to create an OpenGL or DirectX “game” window and then add it to Discord to put their overlay on it. You can then use OBS game capture to display the portions you want on stream.

I use this when I want viewers to see the 5 or so people who I am chatting with via microphone.

**Free Twitch Themes**

I use one of these sets for my own page. Easy way to make your page look a bit more professional.


**Twitch Alerts**

I use popup alerts so that the room is notified when I have a new follower or someone makes a donation. Even better, I can tie into their API and have the latest follower have their name remain on screen. Here are some of the features available (and all free):

* Popup Alerts
* Stream Labels
* Donation Goals

You’ll also need this Chrome extension, which creates a .txt file for you, so that you can display some of the information about stream labels on your screen.

**Kap Chat**

Overlay chat from your Twitch room into your actual video feed with this. You can style it with an CSS, and create transparent backgrounds, as well as fade, so it’s never intrusive to people watching your feed.


**Stream Tip**

This is a simple way to setup payments for your stream. I believe you need a PayPal account for this to work, but it only took me a couple of minutes total. From here, I added a PayPal button to my Twitch page, so when people click on it, they are brought to my tips page.

**Better TTV**

This make Twitch far easier to view. Dark themes, anon chat, recent chat history, and custom emotes are just a handful of the things you can quickly add with this.

**Strexm**

This service allows you to easily overlay many of the things I've listed above. I've used this for a bit and really loved it. Rather than you create your overlays yourself, you can select some great pre-made ones from them, they provide a URL, and you simply give OBS the URL to draw on top of your stream!

 

**Discord**

While not directly related to Twitch, I use this chat program for finding other people to play with. Whether it is Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, or Paragon, I can find a full group any time of day, and we all have microphones. Needless to say, this makes your stream more engaging, too.

4o3c0v,1.5 Years of Streaming - A Review + Lessons Learned,"Hello for a 3rd time! I am right near my 1.5 years of streaming and I thought I would give a quick update like I did at 6 months in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3cvx5f/6_months_of_streaming_a_review_lessons_learned/) and 1 year in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40zyxw/1_year_of_streaming_a_review_lessons_learned/). I'll cover my month to month, then switch over to lessons/new goals.

&amp;nbsp;

##**First 1 year Summary**
Really briefly I'll discuss the first 1 year in the event you don't want to read the other threads. I started over from scratch streaming essentially and found myself speedrunning Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction. This was a game that I really enjoyed and I loved the challenge. After 6 months, by the end of July, I had ~1100 followers and was starting to peak around 75-150 viewers depending the night, which was awesome. The next 6 months I was able to gain some tremendous growth, get partnership, and cap it off in January with a speedrun at AGDQ in front of 175,000 people.

##**Goals I had hoped to accomplish by my 1.5 year (right now) stream anniversary**

1. Have my graphics guy re-design all of my buttons and my profile banner/logo. Right now I sort of have a mixed half and half combination of old stuff I made and new stuff he made, and I think it would look a lot more professional if it was all custom stuff done by him.  **DONE** - New graphics made, new buttons, new emotes, etc. Very happy with this.  

2. Make an intro video/cut scenes!!! I think this is one of my most important goals moving forward because right now I have one great screen (my main layout) and then everything else is just complete garbage! This will definitely be an improvement when done.  **Done/failed** - Still don't have an intro video, but I have my scenes made up now and I think a lot of people enjoy them.  

3. Get on a Twitch team with like-minded individuals and get some plans made for the future. I'm currently in the process of this one and I think it will be important for the future as growing with a network of people is just ever so helpful! Additionally, being able to share ideas and anything with each other has already beneficial and I know it will only get better the more we grow together.  **Done/failed** I have joined a couple of Twitch teams but they haven't really taken off like I've wanted. I will continue to pursue this.  

4. I need to really focus on Twitter/Youtube at this point as well. I already put focus on them before, but I think now I'm starting to actually see good progress there and I need to focus on being active. For Youtube I want to highlight probably about 5 videos per week, and for Twitter I want to make sure I'm networking and sending out additional tweets beyond the stream ones.  **Done** - My Twitter has grown some and I definitely use it a bit more, but I'd say I'm most proud of my Youtube change. In the past 6 months I've grown my Youtube from 1200 to 7500+ subscribers and that has now become an active community as well.  

5. I want to do something else with the current push up system that I have. I think it does a great job, but at the same time some days I can't get through all push ups and I'm left with spillover and such. I think possibly doing something like changing it to 1 REP (situp, push up, squat, etc) of my choosing instead of 1 push up may be more helpful, or adjusting how the numbers work may not be a bad idea. This is something I'll need to think about more. One thing I think would be interesting is having viewers be able to donate push ups to help out. So if the counter is at 200 and they tweet me them doing 20 verified push ups, I get to drop the counter to 180 or something? Could be interesting... **Failed?** - I ended up getting injured in hockey and needing shoulder surgery, which basically threw streaming/push ups on the back burner for a while. Still not allowed to get back into push ups yet, so I'm still figuring this system out.  


&amp;nbsp;

##**January**
I already went through a lot of January in my past post so I won't talk about it too much here. Basically though, it finished out as well as it started and we were able to see some amazing growth coming off of AGDQ (which brought in a lot of followers not just immediately but also still to this day people find me from it). Around this time was also when my youtube channel started to really kick off and gain some growth that I've been able to maintain, which I think has been one of my biggest successes in the past 6 months. Not only does it provide a little bit of an extra income, but it provides a lot of extra exposure to people that may never have used Twitch before.  

Time broadcasted: **125 hours**

Follows: **3600**

&amp;nbsp;

##**February**
February was another absolutely stellar month, right alongside January. This was my biggest month for subscribers, a very large month for followers, streams averaging around 400-500 amazing viewers, a peak of 1500 viewers (I did a marathon run that was brutal and saw 1000+ viewers the whole time), and more. This was also the month that things started to go downhill though, as I separated my AC joint playing hockey at the end of February (AKA ripped all tendons in my shoulder) and was forced to back off push ups, streaming, have surgery, etc. My surgery date was March 3rd and I will really start to go into the important stuff in that month as I feel there's a lot of lessons learned from it.  

Time broadcasted: **124 hours**

Follows: **1950**

&amp;nbsp;

##**March**
March 3rd was my surgery date. From this date forward I was in a sling for 10 weeks, only able to come out of it for using the computer after about 5-6 weeks. This was probably the biggest challenge I faced streaming as it led to multiple problems:

1. I had to skip a few days for surgery and surgery recovery. This of course ruins your consistency and as much as you wish every viewer/subscriber would stick around and wait for you, the truth is that isn't always the case.

2. I could no longer (and still to this day) do push ups. The recovery period for being able to do push ups again is probably 6 months from surgery minimum. This was one of the really fun parts of my stream that I think drew in extra views/follows/donations/subs and I had to learn how to deal with that.

3. I was a speedrunner...who needed 2 hands to speedrun...This led me down some interesting paths that I will talk about soon.

When I started streaming again I found my numbers had dropped and at first it was a little sad but I also had to be reasonable and recognize that I had been gone, I was no longer a fast speedrunner for the time being, and I was going to have to figure out something else. So I started experimenting. I played some 1 handed Diablo 2 speedrunning because I know a lot of people enjoyed D2. Although it didn't draw quite the same crowds, I found enough people seemed somewhat interested at least and I was able to maintain about 200-250 viewers. Beyond that, I actually started experimenting going into other games again. The last time I did this, it was a complete failure. My d2 streams were averaging about 100-150 people and when I would try to switch to Dota 2 or Starcraft 2 I'd be happy to see 15-20 people there. I was just too small and too buried and I unfortunately couldn't make variety work that well. This time around though, I knew I had a bigger community to draw from so I started playing a run through of Ocarina of Time since I could use a controller and keep my arm in the sling. While my numbers were never the highest ever, I was able to see anywhere from 80-200 people and I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing. It was also just a nice break to be honest as I had been grinding a lot of Diablo 2 and being able to even do 1 day a week of something else really helps. I was thinking about incorporating some Zelda speedrunning into my play some day but I've yet to get it all setup (though I did get all the gear so we're very close!). In regards to push ups, I just had to put it on hold and switch up the number counter from push ups needed to be done to making it where every 1000 points that were accumulated I would have to do some awful Diablo run later.  

Time broadcasted: **99 hours**

Follows: **915**

&amp;nbsp;

##**April**
April actually had a lot more experimenting as well and not the best streaming. I saw some success with Zelda and thought I would try to make my way over into The Culling, but unfortunately being mediocre at a game that's very different from Diablo 2 doesn't quite draw the crowds. I know a few of my viewers enjoyed it, but overall it just was too far away from my core game right now. Lirik can do this stuff, not me yet. This month also was a time of a lot of travel so I wasn't able to be as consistent as I was hoping to be for streaming, so at the end of the month I honestly wasn't disappointed with the numbers one bit. One really nice thing that came about from April was that I visited PAX East and was able to hang out with some viewers, some other streamers, some partners, and some Twitch Staff. I don't think this event was quite as beneficial to me as something like AGDQ, but I was very happy to go because I straight up forced myself to talk to other people. I was extremely nervous and avoided it the first couple of days but then I just said, ""do it or go home"" and it was the best advice I gave myself. From that I was able to meet and interact with about 20-30 other partners that I now am able to collaborate with, I was able to connect with Twitch staff and get a spot on the Frontpage every Tuesday night from 10pm-12am, and I was able to simply build confidence which I think is always a bonus.

##**May**
OUT OF THE SLING!! This month was great as I was finally completely out of my sling and able to get back into streaming. This month I really got back into grinding some good Diablo 2 speedrunning, with the addition of Starcraft speedrunning and game play (which as another Blizzard game actually draws a little crowd!). Front page definitely brought me some new viewer peaks (2500+) and I was able to start looking around at once again trying to find ways to improve the stream. It was at this point that I got my graphics re-done, added more cut scenes, etc. I also started playing a tiny bit online and getting some items that I could giveaway to other players as a fun little thing to do. With everything combined, I was able to start seeing viewer numbers grow back to the 400-700 range. The only thing I don't like too much about this month is the 143 hours streaming. I think that number might be a tad high considering I work fulltime as well, so it could be unsustainable. Definitely need to watch my hours to make sure I don't burn out and still get some sleep at least!

##**June - so far**
And that brings us to June! The big news thus far this month was that I picked up SteelSeries as a sponsor, which is one more step for me towards moving towards a fulltime stream position. What I liked about this sponsorship was how much the perks helped benefit the community. Now I get gear to giveaway every month to viewers, the ability to travel to more events to hang out with more people, etc. In terms of streaming this month, my numbers are continuing up and I'm hoping to cross the 15,000 followers by the end of the month which has been a bit of a goal lately. I also started experimenting with streaming earlier on weekends and not only does it allow for more EU viewers but it also frees up my evenings to go out with friends. I think my work/stream/life balance was a little bit off before and now it's starting to really find a place that's manageable which is super important.

Time broadcasted: **60 hours**

##**A Look Back and BIG Lessons learned**
So what big lessons have I learned in these 6 months??

1. Numbers go up, numbers go down. Life happens and sometimes you just have to roll with it and keep your chin up. My shoulder injury was unfortunate, but we worked with it and kept streaming and eventually things picked back up again.

2. You need to stay sane. I've watched myself burnout, I've watched other streamers burnout, I've watched friends burnout, etc. If you only do the exact same thing over and over and over, you will eventually get exhausted from it and not enjoy it anymore. This is why I think keeping a good balance in your life is necessary, even if it means somewhat stunting growth here and there. For me I've been able to find balance in: Streaming other similar games, taking days off when needed, streaming in mornings on weekends. I really want to touch on the first point here too about streaming other similar games. I have a community and that community likes to watch Diablo 2. Now, of the X people that like to watch Diablo 2, I'm going to find a lot more of them also like Path of Exile than like CounterStrike. Thus when moving around games I need to be careful that I'm sticking to certain genres, staying within speedrunning, sticking to classic games from a similar time (Zelda/Starcraft), etc. Sure I CAN go off to any game and maybe it kinda works, but I'll have to expect a larger drop off there. If that's what I need to balance out though and keep streaming in the future, maybe I do it. Stay sane!

3. Interact with other streamers. I would not be where am I today if I didn't make friendships with other streamers. Find other people in your game, find other streamers that have a similar personality, etc and just make friends. Don't push your stream on them, don't drop in their chat and say, ""Well cya I'm gonna go live now"" or anything annoying like that. Simply go and be friends and maybe throw them some hosts and who knows they may return the favor some day. If they don't, oh well! Now of course, it's important to find people similar or smaller in size if you're thinking about hosts and merging communities. If I host Lirik and expect a host back, it would just be foolish. Regardless, making friends with so many other streamers has led to awesome races, host bombs, skype calls, trying out different games, learning different stream tricks/tactics, etc. It would be hard to stream without having stream friends.

4. Find where you can grow your community, as that is a huge selling point of your stream. When I started out I just had Twitch, and honestly that was fine for the start. Now however I have a Youtube community and a Discord community and both of those have been absolutely wonderful. They are great places that similar minded people can stay engaged and keep connected and it just opens up so many more doors for me. At the same time, the effort necessary is something I can live with and have accepted. For instance, my Youtube videos are only highlights of runs and games from my stream. It takes me about 10 minutes per video to get it all ready which is completely worth my time and allows me to put out a lot of content. I also spend time going through every Youtube comment on my videos and replying to a lot of them, which also takes time but I think has been helpful and kept people engaged. If I compare that to when I casted Starcraft 2 matches a few years ago, those videos took me about 3-4 hours of work per video and at the end of the day it simply wasn't worth the amount of effort. My discord requires me to check in here and there and I had to spend some time learning how to set it all up properly, but now I have a great place to stay in contact 24/7 with my viewers and that is invaluable. Maybe your place to engage a community is Twitter, maybe it's instagram, or maybe it's somewhere completely different. Finding your growth spots though and where you can increase your exposure is extremely important in my mind if you wish to continue pushing forward.

5. Appreciate everyone when they're there, but don't dread when they leave. People come and go, they might enjoy your stream for 6 months then decide they want to watch someone else or go outside and stop watching Twitch or whatever! Sometimes this is a big donor, sometimes it's a mod, sometimes it's a regular viewer who was there every day. Don't take it too hard, this is just the natural way of streaming and the natural way of life! The best thing I've found to do is to just engage with the people who are there because those are the people who want to watch the show you're putting on and if you want them to stick around for a while they should probably get some attention!

6. Last but not least, always keep improving. I've probably said it before, but I think this is one of the most important ways to grow. To this day I am still looking at hardware, software, games, cutscenes, panels, buttons, emotes, shirts, sponsors, etc that can bring another dimension to my stream and I attribute a lot of my success to simply trial and error. For every idea that has worked on my stream, I've had 3-4 fail. The nice thing is people don't really care or remember the failures, so if you do something for a week and it doesn't go well you can just kill it and it's fine. EXPERIMENT! Try new things! Your imagination is the only limit.


&amp;nbsp;

##**Future Ideas/Goals**  

Keep improving right? Here are things I want to do going forward:  
1. Get my Wii setup and start speedrunning Zelda. I want to see if there's another community there I can tap into that can be balanced well between D2 and Zelda.  

2. Reconstruct my ""push up counter"" which right now is still a bit in limbo. I think it needs to be shifted into a monthly or weekly thing that unlocks certain prizes....could be fun!

3. I think I still need to find one good way to bring my communities together a bit more. Maybe discord is that answer, but right now I don't really do enough to promote it everywhere. I should probably look at ways in every community that I can really reach out and draw people in.

4. re-visit the team idea and stretch out a bit more there to see if there's potential growth with a team. I need to really find a group that works together more and does something different.

5. 50 followers/day average. This is my stretch goal and I know I won't always reach it but I think it's good to push towards something difficult like that. Really gives me drive to keep going but at the same time if I've pushed hard and have done well I know there is time to relax too.


&amp;nbsp;

And that's about it! I remember when I first started 1.5 years ago I looked around on this forum for tips and tricks to get ahead so I hope this is helpful at least a little bit to some of you. The best advice for those looking to start is to just START! Once you start, then you can look at improving, but too many times people try to prep too much and they never just start streaming and learning as they go. Good luck and thank you! If you ever have any questions just let me know and I'm happy to answer.

4o2b1i,What's going on with HTML5? Q2 2016 ends June 30th and there's been no information/updates about it,"Back at TwitchCon they said in Q2 2016 they would release their HTML5 player and replace flash. Q2 is about to end in a little over two weeks on June 30th. We still haven't had any info about their HTML5 player. 

The person who made the [Userscript \(TwitchHTML5\)](https://github.com/EchoDev/TwitchHTML5) to change the Twitch player to the beta HTML5 player says that it's enabled now, but you need to ~~disable HTTPS~~ disable mixed content protection manually to access HTML5? That doesn't make sense. ~~It's insecure, and Twitch itself will not allow you to do so because it auto redirects to the HTTPS site (as it should).~~ Check the bottom of the post from EchoDev with a more detailed response. 

&gt; ""Twitch still hasn't switched to HTTPS backends for HTML5, you need to temporarily disable mixed content protection to be able to watch"" 
- [TwitchHTML5 Developer \(EchoDev on Github\)](https://github.com/EchoDev/TwitchHTML5/issues/40)

How about an official response from Twitch? 

My fans go from quiet to full rpms from 1 twitch stream. It's ridiculous. I know about the alternatives (userscripts, [streamhtml5.com](http://streamhtml5.com/), player.twitch.tv) but official support by default would be super nice.

------

EDIT: Twitch Encoding/Playback Engineer /u/slimscsi posted a response, but it got downvoted and hidden by default. Here's the response: 

&gt; The script mentioned is not supported by twitch, and we DO NOT recommend altering ANY security settings in your browser. All official communication will come from the Twitch blog and Twitter account. So keep watching those for updates! 

/u/echodev (dev of TwitchHTML5 userscript) in response to /u/slimscsi 

&gt;Funny how you seem to care about security but still haven't fully switched to HTML5 and you backend still being http instead of https.
You are basically pushing for Flash, which is insecure as can be, instead of manually disabling mixed content protection on Twitch (Which is purely and only on Twitch and has to be done manually every time).

&gt;@OP:
You do not need to disable HTTPS, you need to disable mixed content protection manually. Twitch still points to http servers for video (even tho https is working fine). Because you are trying to load video over http on a https site, the browser blocks this. You can manually disable this protection for a specific page (atleast the way it is on Firefox) so that the stream can work. This does not disable mixed content protection globally, just on that specific streamer page.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4o2b1i/whats_going_on_with_html5_q2_2016_ends_june_30th/,1465922526.0,63,0.94,25,Twitch,envious_1

4nq3o1,"Stream Companion, the Android app for one-monitor streamers is out!","(mod approved, thanks!)

Hi everyone!

You might remember [my post](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4llv12/onemonitor_streamers_would_you_be_interested_in/) from 2 weeks ago that described an android app I was coding initially for myself. The goal of the app is to be a all-in-one stream monitor solution, and is especially useful for people that only have one screen. It does the following :

* Display twitch chat (with emotes &amp; sub/mod badges)
* (Optionally) Display the number of current viewers
* (Optionally) Hook into twitch alerts so you don't have to alt-tab to see who followed/donated/hosted you
* Has a few options like font size and displaying timestamps

Everything is done in the same view, the app is pretty bulky and not very eye-candied, but honestly I figured no one would care about that.

Right now, the app is in beta for the sole reason that mostly I tested it, but it should be pretty solid regardless. Also it's free, has no ads, and the only authorization it requires is an internet access.

You'll find the play store page for *Stream Companion* along with screenshots [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streamhelper.streamhelper). (many thanks to a friend of mine who drew that icon for me)

In case you were wondering, here's what the app *can't* do as of now : 

* Write to the chat. This would require you to login via twitch (as you do in t'chat), and is not really within the philosophy of the app
* Hook into other alert/tipping services. It's in my longterm TODO but I can't guarantee anything

I'll gladly take any feedback, whether it's small things that annoy you or bigger features you'd like built into the app. Also, bug reports :D .

Thanks for reading!

PS : The apk is not protected and can be decompiled to recover the original source code. The reason it's not open source is because right now the code is slightly messy and I wouldn't be satisfied with it being part of my portfolio, but going open source is one of my goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4nq3o1/stream_companion_the_android_app_for_onemonitor/,1465735750.0,88,0.97,26,Twitch,Elyotna

Then I go to look up these accounts and they are seemingly not in use, no followers, havent logged in forever, havent posted any content or its been over a year. Some of them are from ""Justin.Tv"" but they didnt move their account to twitch so its just a name thats taken forever now I guess.

A) Fitting to my personality

B) Easy to remember and simple

C) Is short, which ties into B but this might be my problem. I dont want a username that is 16 characters long with numbers and _ and such...

4n90gu,"Tonight, my stream was re-streamed on Clansy.TV where it had over 120 viewers...","Hi all; Big rant from an up-and-comer.

I am a music production streamer, part of Creative #music and #musicproduction, and I have been streaming faithfully on Twitch for 4 months. I had an amazing day today on stream, shooting well over my usual viewership at some points. I have been averaging about 40-45 this month. I am not partnered, and have been working my hardest to maintain a high-quality stream and regular schedule towards my goal of being partnered one day.

I found out today from one of my Turkish viewers that he had found me on a site called Clansy.TV. I was surprised, as I had no idea what that was. It seems to be exclusively eastern European.

It turns out, someone on Clansy.TV was re-broadcasting my stream on a fake account, and it had between 120 and 140 viewers each time I checked.

This is 3 to 4 times more than my regular viewership. I am attempting to apply for partnership, which makes each concurrent viewer count, and seeing someone fake my channel on another sketchy site and have hundreds of viewers is extremely disappointing. That being said, this is also a potential loss of revenue from streamers who may have many more viewers than I do at a time, and Twitch.TV itself, because the site seems to have some sort of paid platform.

Here is proof, including some of the other streamers whose broadcasts were also ripped: http://imgur.com/QxvnGEg

4n0tq5,Announcing zeroviewers.com [alpha] - a directory of live channels with no viewers.,"(Modmail approved repost)

Greetings, all.
Throughout my time browsing this sub, there have been several mentions of sites, systems, or something focused on live channels with almost no viewers.
Knowing that the API provides all that I would need, I went ahead and launched [zeroviewers.com](https://www.zeroviewers.com/), an alternative stream directory where the main criteria is *no one is watching*. It updates every ten minutes or so, and can filter by game.

I'd appreciate any feedback on the site itself, but know that there really aren't any goals for it other than what it is; a filtered listing.

I invite you to pop into a channel and say ""Hi"" to a stream dreamer. During this development, I watched a lot of these streams, and was pleasantly surprised by a lot that I found.

Edit 11 June : Thanks for all the great feedback! Here are some of the new changes since the initial post:

- ignores channels live over 9 hours
- records channels with 0-4 viewers
- can filter by broadcaster language
- can login and upvote channels
- can sort several ways

4m2ays,Want to grow and get sponsors? We’d like to help you get a headstart.,"(Pre-approved, thank you mod team!) 

More than a year ago, I posted a comment in [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2juq7z/obtaining_sponsors/) in response to someone asking how to get sponsorships. In it, I mentioned we were looking at building a way to help streamers connect better with sponsors.

We’ve had more than 20 PMs since asking about its progress, and so we built [Fundeavour](http://www.fundeavour.com?utm_source=redditp&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=redditp) - a site that aims to give gamers a headstart in eSports, streaming and Youtube.

*****


# What are we about?

Many of us here want to know how to grow our streams and eventually get sponsored, but often, we don’t know what we need to do to get brands to sit up and listen.  

That’s not all - to grow our channels, we’d probably need to:

**1) Spend money.** Good equipment makes a massive difference in gameplay or when you’re trying to produce high quality videos and streams. Unfortunately, good equipment is often expensive.

**2) Get noticed** - by new followers, collaborators and sponsors, because there are simply way too many of us.


*****
So, we put our heads together to create three simple solutions:

### 1) Free gear that helps you go further:

* And no, we don’t mean lanyards and keychains - we’re actively working with gaming brands to provide free gear like headsets, keyboards and more. 
* All you need to do is complete a series of Adventures (more on this below), where you’ll not only learn to be a more effective gaming personality, but to put them to the test in Adventures with our partnered brands.  
* Simply collect points from Adventures and redeem our Rewards (and if you think about it ….almost like getting sponsored, but not just for the big guys!)

###  2) Linking effort to exposure

* Completing Adventures gets you on the Hall of Heroes (our leaderboard) where you’re automatically featured to other users who log in. 
* The top 3 each month get interviewed with our media partner, providing a natural way for our most hardworking gamers to get discovered, regardless of how big or small their stream/channel is. We just announced our first cohort yesterday!


### 3) Adventures - 

* These are a collection of quests providing tips and tricks on how to begin growing your streaming / gaming career, and presents a series of small tasks for you to complete to apply what you’ve learnt. 
* We like to think of Adventures as “paths” for you to take, with defined end-goals that our brands and our team provide as Rewards. These can range from free gear to a chance to be “hired” as a reviewer/caster/ambassador for the brand. Two such opportunities are currently up.

*****


Bear in mind that a lot of these things are pretty much still evolving as we go through Alpha. But this is also why we’re inviting you to join us - we’d love if you could help guide our direction in this early stage.

Any comments and feedback would be awesome. :)

PS: If you’d like to chat with us in person, we also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/0zC7O0fFsGpTRvuh) where our current members hang out. Feel free to join in!

However when you DO use it, they strike mutes all over your recorded videos.

BUT THEY LET YOU CONTEST IT!

uhh, yeah, you can.. however, the video falls off the 2 week shelf before anyone ever gets back to you from twitch. 

so far off this ""approved"" list, https://soundcloud.com/twitchfm/sets/twitch-music-library-1 I've gotten 17 strikes in 3 different videos.  Even muted, i am not allowed to export the video to youtube, so entire session ARE LOST!

Here is a video i made with screen shots 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l4uNGNG6iA

IS anyone else having this issue?

EDIT1:
just to clarify folks, there are 2 issues here. Twitch algorithms striking down mutes on videos they themselves have LITERALLY PROVIDED...
And the lack of response time to challenges before a video gets removed from your twitch short term archive.

4lvrfe,"Help streamers out. If you see something's obviously wrong with the stream, please tell them","Soooo I recently started streaming and I haven't really had that many viewers and no one really interacting in chat. Today I started playing The Walking Dead and the viewer count went up to around 4-5 and someone said ""Hi"" in the chat, and I answered and asked him how to pronounce his nick etc. It felt nice. He didn't say anything more though and left, and the viewer count went back to 1. It felt a bit disheartening.  
About 30-40 minutes after I started streaming a friend came into the channel and told me my microphone wasn't working. That made me feel extremely stupid. Such a simple but vital thing and I had forgotten to check it. I fixed it and continued streaming and I eventually had some people hanging out and talking and got a couple of followers so that was really awesome. But it still felt bad that I missed out in the start.  
I realize it doesn't matter at all in the end and that it happens but it still felt kind of bad. So if you get into a channel and you see someone on cam talking and not hearing them, or any other issue you think might not be correct, please make them aware, even if you leave immediately after. I know it's not your problem or obligation or anything and it's a stupid mistake but it's a nice thing to do and it could help out a lot.  
  
tldr: If you see something wrong with the stream, please try to make the streamer aware. Be nice!  
  
Edit for clarity: Of course this is my own fault and the streamers responsibility. What I mean is that sometimes it might be difficult for the streamer to know if something's not right, something might happen mid stream etc. This was purely my own stupid mistake but it made me think about it in general.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4lvrfe/help_streamers_out_if_you_see_somethings/,1464708420.0,239,0.97,58,Twitch,TheOdee
4lnurt,PSA to New Streamers: Don't Call Out Lurkers,"There's been a few of these posts, but I don't think the action of calling out lurkers is frowned upon enough. I see so many streamers who are still keeping a close eye on who's in their chat, and even some streamers that have chat bots to call out any new viewer that shows up. Here's my take on why this will only negatively impact the community that you're trying to grow.

***

First of all, dispel any idea of having an auto-welcoming chat bot. It's a bad idea and only makes you seem disingenuous. If you're trying to build a fan-base, do it yourself and don't automate things that don't need to be automated.

With that said, bots are easy. It's harder not to have a peek at your viewer list every once in awhile, I understand that. The best advise I can give is to simply hide your viewer count and try not to look at the viewer list. **You can hide your view count in your Twitch dashboard by clicking on the red viewer icon while you are live.** Streaming will become much more fun and natural if you aren't worried about viewers.

If you can't help but look at your viewer list, just keep it to yourself. The people who want to talk will talk, and the lurkers will lurk. Trying to encourage a lurker to speak is basically just saying, ""Hey I'm looking at my viewer list right now and I need you to speak to me because I'm lonely."" That's what I get from it at least.

***

**tl;dr:** Don't look at your viewer list.

Again, sorry for the repetitive post, but I've been seeing more of this than ever and it really [grinds my gears.](https://theissuesdesk.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/geats.png)

4llv12,"One-monitor streamers, would you be interested in an android app ?","Fellow streamers,

A while back, [I asked on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40zcgh/best_android_app_for_a_twitch_streamer/) if there existed an android app to assist the random 1-monitor streamer that I am. The app I was looking for would display the chat, the number of viewers, and optionally hook into twitch alerts to have follow/donation/sub/host warnings.

Well, the situation hasn't evolved in months, so I decided to just make my own. Here are some screenshots of the current developement :

Note : I am not foxdrop, just needed a stream to test it on. The blurred field in the settings screenshot is my twitch alerts token.

Anyway, if I receive positive feedback from this, I'll gladly polish the app and publish it on the play store. If I do so, it'll be free and ad-free. There are numerous quality of life improvements to be made, but I'm not sure I have the strength to do them if the app is only going to benefit me.

Also, I'll gladly read any suggestion!

Edit : Big thanks for all your encouragement. I'll get back to work and make it as good as posible. See ya in hopefully not a long time for a beta release.

You know, show some love. Well, here's where I'm annoyed. First streamer I go into, no mic, so that sucks, but I tried to chat. No response. Also, the first thing you see on his page is a big ass DONATE button...you have 3 followers, like WTF? Next stream I pop on, guy is talking seems ok. I start chatting, hey what's up, what mission are you doing, and wait you know until there's a break. NO RESPONSE. Also, guess what else he had, another BIG ASS Donate button. So I said, ""dude, just a tip, people like interaction on twitch you should check out the chat, cause that's why I'm leaving"" I just can't believe that people actually expect donations when they don't interact with others. I'm working with a friend streamer right now who plays games REALLY well, like he's as good as a pro. But, he feels weird asking for donations. Then you've got these guys with their 3 followers who ask for shite and don't even talk to you.

4letyk,Creative is a mess tonight,"There are TONS of awesome streams tonight in Creative with people doing all kinds of cool creative things.

But there's also/also been:

- 2 different girls just sitting and chatting
- A livestream of a nightclub
- Someone's lame party
- A family sitting around their living room while a kid plays with a VR headset
- A group drinking and playing a board game
- 3 drunk guys occasionally singing &amp;amp;amp; playing a guitar (badly), one of them only in his boxer briefs. Later he managed to find a shirt, but one of his buddies was passed out on the bed while the other smacked him in the junk with a ukelele.
- Someone who just went to bed and left a note that they'd be back in the morning

Why does Creative become such a dumping ground? Weekends are the worst.

Edit: A couple of people have asked why I care, so let me elaborate I guess? I've been a constant viewer on Twitch for a couple of years and streamed briefly last year. At our house, we watch Twitch more than Netflix and we don't cable. I started streaming in Creative two weeks ago (weekdays, so it's not like I'm bitching about competition) and it's been a blast, so I'm feeling a little protective of it. Most of my favorite (game) streamers have migrated to other games I'm not interested in for now and I find myself spending more and more time in Creative watching those streams. As a result I skip around a lot and wind up viewing the category list many, many times looking at the thumbnails since there are so many different things - it's not like going into a game category where it's all the same, just different streamers. You kind of *have* to look at each individual thumbnail. So, last night, I wound up seeing Underwear Guy, Lame Party, etc. over and over and just needed to vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4letyk/creative_is_a_mess_tonight/,1464418495.0,55,0.88,90,Twitch,70ms

4l8t0m,I have received 664 (and counting) emails in attempt to reset my Twitch password. No support from Twitch. How is this acceptable?,"Hello everyone. I am unfortunately writing this because I need to vent my frustrations somewhere that it might actually be heard. I have emailed Twitch support 4 times, I have Tweeted at Twitch and at Twitch support multiple times to get some answers, and I have not even gotten a ""we're busy, hang tight"" response.

Starting at around 8pm last night, I got 3 consecutive emails, saying that someone had tried to reset my password on Twitch. They all came at the exact same time. 5 minutes later, 3 more. I start getting pretty concerned at this point and make sure that my 2-step is still turned on (it is) and delete the emails. 

5 minutes later, another 3 emails at the exact same time. I was playing some games with friends, so I figured that I'd just wait it out until they gave up trying to get into my account. No such luck. By midnight, I had over 100 emails.

So, I emailed Twitch Support with updated screenshots of my sad state of an inbox. I tweeted asking for some help. 

The frustrating part is that I can't turn off notifications on my phone because I am waiting for an important update from an ill family member. So I eventually had to turn off email notifications (which I also dislike doing because important stuff does not pop up) and went to bed, hoping that in the morning I'd be in the clear.

Nope. At about 9 am, I was sitting at around 420 emails. So I tweet at Twitch and Twitch Support again. Wait a few hours and now I'm at 500 emails, and no response.

Tweet them again, and update my email thread, 600 emails. 

Now, I am not worried about losing my account, or someone hacking into it for whatever reason (I have like 10 followers and rarely stream anyways) because I do have my security set up right. My concern is that Twitch hasn't responded, as well as the fact that someone can just ""bot"" the password reset form over and over and over (650 times) to one account. I say botting because they come in triplets, every 5-10 minutes. It's not 1 request, then in a minute, another one. It's 3 at the exact same time. 

Shouldn't this raise some kind of red flag? Someone trying to reset their password hundreds and hundreds of times? Why is there no security measure that cuts them off at a certain point and requires intervention from Twitch? Or something else. I am not a developer or coder or whatever, but there HAS to be something to prevent this kind of nonsense. This is crazy and extremely frustrating that they have not even looked in my direction after contacting them at least 8 times.

I just want some answers. Yes, I know I can just mark them as junk, but that doesn't solve the issue that someone can just request a password reset over and over and over and over for 24 hours. 

As of writing this, I am now at 670 emails. 

TL;DR: Someone has been spamming my password reset form. 670+ times in 24 hours and Twitch has not responded to any support requests. 

:edit: I am now up to 775 emails. 

:edit again: I am now over 1,200 emails in about 36 hours. I had gotten an email response, and they said that they blocked the IP that was sending the requests, but that was at around 750 emails, so clearly it did nothing.

d9bolg,"Always control how your mods behave, especially if you're a small streamer.","So, this is one of those things that are obvious but doesn't hurt to be enforced from time to time.

You should ALWAYS control how your mods behave, and keep an eye on how others react to their comments/how they enforce rules. Because just like you, they hold a decent percentage of how new viewers view your channel.

And if you are a small streamer and don't actually have mods JUST for moderation or pay mods to do their work, you should have extra attention to that. We as small streamers tend to give mod status to friends and usually they can be mean or kinda want to take over the whole chat. So even if they are your friends, it's good from the start that you let them know that you gave mod so they could actually moderate/act like a judge, and not act with personal attacks or have feelings towards trolls or w/e.

A good moderator just need to enforce rules, be respectful and act as a normal viewer. I often see moderators spamming in small chats for no reason, just because they get excited and have the power to do so, or get angry because they took some comment as personal insult. This is a mistake and can or WILL make new people leave your channel.

**""What do I enjoy?"" ""How do I make this a group activity?"" ""How do I make this interesting to watch?"" ""What am I excited to share with my audience on today's stream?""**

Even most popular streamers are kinda doing the same thing as well.

d6v70i,Should I go with two PC setup or upgrade my monitors?,"Morning gamers and streamers!

So I've been dabbling in the stream life for a month or so now for funsies. I've learned a lot about getting the setup right and I feel like I'm close to getting my setup where it needs to be, but I have one hurdle that I'm having trouble getting over. That hurdle is Destiny 2.

I have a pretty decent rig with an i7-8700k and an RTX 2080. I have basically no issue streaming any game I play that I can use game capture. My issues come when trying to stream or record Destiny 2 using OBS or SLOBS.

For those of you who don't know, Bungie (Destiny 2s developer) does not allow third party programs to capture their game as an anti cheat measure. This means my recording software cannot capture Destiny 2 using game capture. The only way I can capture it is to use Display capture or Window capture. This is not ideal. Both setting have their issues and result in some sort of performance dip. It's a pain that I've been trying to work around for a month now. 

I've tried almost everything and have gotten close. I've tried window capture and running in borderless window (I much prefer fullscreens as I feel just enough input lag that it's frustrating). I have recently landed on playing in fullscreen and running my fps around 105. If I run OBS in the background on my same gaming monitor and make sure none of my other 2 monitors have any sort of video running, I can play at 105 fps for about 80% of my gameplay but i STILL get occasional frame or performance dips which is insanely frustrating. 

I would hate to spend lots of money on a dedicated streaming pc JUST for destiny 2 and for just streaming for fun to low viewer counts. I've read threads that say my setup would benefit from having my other monitors being 144hz like my gaming monitor, as somehow them being only 60hz is screwing with something. 

Anyway, has anyone come across this issue and figured out a resolution? Or do you have a suggestion on if I should just get a 2nd dedicated streaming pc? I don't mind spending on it as I can just sell it on a loss if I decide to stop in the future. I'm just dreading having to get through the process of setting it all up, running two microphones, etc :P

EDIT/UPDATE: My current setup as of this morning was 3 monitors. My main gaming monitor which was 144hz and my other two being both 60hz. As mentioned before, my rig is strong and when using game capture I never had an issue with any game while recording or streaming. It was only with Destiny 2 where I had to use display capture, and through lots of Reddit research I was very much thinking that people were right and my main issue was recording on display capture on a 144hz monitor at 100+ frames in tandem with two 60hz monitors. 

I am all for using a 2nd PC to stream. I believe in the end that is absolutely going to give you the best experience if you're taking streaming seriously. That being said, I do have an RTX 2080 and Nvidia loved to talk about how their RTX line has a separate component that allows you to stream using your gpu while using much less resources. In my experience so far, they weren't kidding. 

I'll still have to test this by streaming live but I always got this performance drop even just having OBS open while using display capture. Today with all 144hz monitors, I not only have had OBS open, but I had the preview going and recorded using NVENC and I stayed at a smooth 105fps in Destiny 2 (that's where I cap it if I'm using OBS, I can run it with my rig at 144fps if I'm playing without trying to stream/record) so hopefully if someone else is trying to stream with a single PC setup with similar specs but is having a similar issue, ask yourself if you're using monitors with different refresh rates and if this could be a problem. 

Also, one way I knew that my rig seemed to be doing okay and that something else was going on was that my fps counter didn't drop when I had my performance drops. It always stayed between 100-105 even though my eyes noticed an obvious drop. 

Hopefully this helps someone else in the future :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/d6v70i/should_i_go_with_two_pc_setup_or_upgrade_my/,1568987399.0,67,0.9,16,Twitch,MoonsHaunted_
d6mbgn,Streamers are people and they don't owe you anything.,"I was watching a stream earlier today where the streamer was singing in an Aussie accent. It was generally a good time until one viewer decided to chime in with their opinion about how good the accent was. They  kept going on about how awful the accent was. We tried explaining that the point of the stream was just to have fun. It was NOT to have the perfect accent. Nobody took issue with the opinion that it was a bad accent, however we did take issue with the way it was stated. The mod stepped in and muted the viewer for not even 30 minutes. When the mute was finished, the viewer lost their crap and then accused the streamer of charging for sub par content. I believe a ban was issued after that.

If you don't like something the streamer is doing, you can respectfully say your opinion or you can just watch something else. You have options. Streamers are doing what they do often for little to no money. I know the roles of entertainer and audience member are less defined than they are on YouTube or traditional media, however that doesn't excuse bad behaviour towards streamers. When you watch a stream you are an audience member. Period. Yes you can interact with the streamer but you do NOT control them. 

I've in customer service jobs for over 15 years. I've dealt with tonnes of people like this. I've found that they respond best to minimal engagement. Basically, 

1) don't debate them - just repeat a simple statement until they give up.

2) Give them an option such to either chill out or take a hike.

3) Ban them

Don't give them the satisfaction of you losing your own shit, that's the last thing you need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/d6mbgn/streamers_are_people_and_they_dont_owe_you/,1568936213.0,803,0.91,90,Twitch,CanadianAndroid
d6bjif,A Message to Anyone Thinking Of Streaming on Facebook Gaming - Twitch is better. Details inside...,"Hello, I signed a contract to stream on Facebook and an NDA with them. After reviewing what I could do with them I decided to simply not move forward with Facebook. **This NDA was signed quite some time ago, so please do not bother trying to guess who I am.**           

**Facebook pays well, but here are the issues:**            
-The Facebook algorithm.           
-Copyright issues with simple things like music.         
-Interactivity.             
-The Interface (UI/UX).            
-Accumulating viewers.         
-Streamer ""freedom.""          
-Lack of ""streamer culture.""            

**The Facebook Algorithm.**           
If you've had a Facebook account since 2010 onward, you'll notice that the way people interact with the photos you post to it, and the posts that you have seen show up in your Facebook feed, have changed significantly. Remember those friends you kept in touch with over the years and you suddenly stopped seeing their photos and other posts? That is the algorithm at work. Ever since Facebook's incident with Cambridge Analytica, Facebook as a company has been pinching people for pennies. In 2014 to 2017 you'd have very viral content show up in front of you, videos, photos, text, you name it. From 2018 onward, this stopped because Facebook wanted to limit the strength of fake news posts, and to increase ad sales / boosted posts. Most importantly, this applies to streams as well. You could have a Facebook fanpage with 500,000 followers, but one person who works at Facebook could game the algorithm to your fanpage and stop you from reaching even 1% of those followers. Oh, and another problem is the way the algorithm notifies your followers that you went live. Instead of notifying everyone who follows your page immediately that you are live, it does this gradually over a ""slow"" process, and they may not even see the notification when you are actually live.           

**Copyright issues with simple things like music.**               
This would restrict you from playing a handful of games that focus on music - DDR, Osu, Beatmania, and other titles. There's also a ton of videos you can't watch on YouTube. More on this later.         

**The Interface (UI/UX).**         
If you just go to fb.gg, the problems are not immediately visible. A mindless (and I mean truly mindless) troll would probably tune in to your stream on their real facebook account, insult you (again, using their REAL Facebook account), and not give it two thoughts. The troll thus endangers himself, and anyone close to him (friends, family, roommates, etc.) it's even worse if the troll lists the city where he lives, because he is effectively doxxing himself. Self-endangering trolls aside, interacting with a streamer requires you to reveal your first and last name. I also noticed a lot of other streamers on the platform were just playing cell phone games, and often times you can't find any quality streamers. One forgiving quality is that streamers on this platform, like mixer, seem to have a lot of interactivity. Oh, and sharing videos. Why is it so difficult to share videos / streams by simply ""clicking"" on a URL / social media post. You have to click on the ""time/date"" of the social media post. This is not ""noob friendly.""         

**Accumulating Viewers**          
With the above paragraph in mind, **Accumulating viewers is much more difficult than on Twitch.** How? Your Facebook posts gain visibility by the number of interactions they get, **not by sharing the post.** Remember me talking about ""interacting forces you to reveal your first and last name"" above? Yeah. Less people interact as a result. Less interactions means less visibility on Facebook. OH! And let's not forget, the evolution of the *share button*. Inevitably, you have seen a funny picture or video and had the urge to click *share* beneath that piece of media on Facebook. Well, in 2019, that's not how the *share button* works. Clicking on *share* will only make that piece of media (photo / video / livestream) visible on your own timeline in 2019. This means if 100 followers share your stream, then their friends will not see it unless they go directly to the followers' timelines.                    

However, from the gamer perspective of accumulating viewers - It feels like, as a gamer, it is far too difficult to pull in viewers (even with established social media presence) unless you do what Ninja did and pull your viewers with you to a different platform. Or maybe if you win some massive gaming tournament and plug your Facebook Fanpage. If any championship gamer were to sign with Facebook, they would have a large viewerbase.          

Oh, last, but not least on the topic of Accumulating viewers - some people started streaming on Facebook in 2017. [Source](https://youtu.be/XYXUCc-Zp60?t=5735) If you can find someone who got big on Facebook streaming, and then go back to their viewership in 2017 and before then, the numbers will be much much higher per stream than 2018 until now. **Thus whoever it is at Facebook that determines the algorithm also determines whether or not you get viewers, and thus whether or not you get paid to stream games.** This makes you ask yourself, ""Is this really a meritocracy? One person or a small group of people at a multibillion dollar company that I have never met decide whether or not I will be successful.""            

**Streamer Freedom - Facebook as a platform can interfere with your sponsorships and collabs.**           
There are simple freedoms by signing with Facebook that you do not have. For example, you cannot use PNG or GIF files to display sponsor logos / logos of collaborating companies. You can still make social media posts promoting products / services of collaborating companies, but they must be separate from your stream. You can also still make appearances for other companies / collaborations, and you can make paid appearances on other streams and streaming platforms for things like ESL One or The International or LCS World Championships, or Blizzcon, or whatever. There's the music and copyright stuff I mentioned above, the games you cannot play on stream, etc. Additionally, you cannot just stream yourself going out with some friends to the bar or eating dinner outside. Whatever you are doing must be at least mildly gaming related. You want to engage in a long chit-chat with your viewers? You'll have to do that from the main menu of whatever game you play. Also, this is a big one, you cannot plug your other social media - YouTube and Twitter cannot be plugged while you are streaming.       

**Lack of streamer culture.**        
There's like no place where all streamers can get together and chit chat. There are various facebook groups for content creators to discuss ideas and concepts, but even those feel ""weird."" With Twitch you can check out a streamer's youtube channel if you missed anything while they were live. The entire atmosphere of Facebook Gaming almost feels ""communist."" I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook were to crank out some sort of VOIP program similar to discord specifically for gamers, and then allow you to use it on stream - but for now it's something they don't have.         

That's basically all I wanted to say.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/d6bjif/a_message_to_anyone_thinking_of_streaming_on/,1568885101.0,650,0.91,78,Twitch,FB_Gaming_Throwaway

d4y7e4,"If you respond to chat in a timely manner, you are more engaging than 90% of streamers","One of the more common types of comments I've seen here is that they prefer to watch small streamers because of superior chat interaction. Over the last week, I've been trying out some of the channels under the Recommended Channels, regardless of how big or small the channel is - yes, I'm being recommend channels with single digit viewership too, even no viewership, much to my surprise - to guage whether I'd enjoy chatting with them.

For context, I'm one of those people who's on Twitch for the social interaction, and not just for entertainment, which makes me the minority because I've been told that 80% viewers are lurkers. I'm very uncomfortable approaching strangers IRL but behind the veil of anonymity, I lose such restrictions. I just strike up a conversation, and based on how much I enjoyed, I'll return and sometimes we have so much in common that it goes on to become a friendship.

In lieu of a better classification, let's use the de facto metric - viewer count - to segregate these ""subjects"", for lack of a better word, into ""big channels"" - over 100 viewers - and ""small channels"" - less than 10 viewers. Sadly, I didn't get recommend anybody in the middle, which is a shame because one of my favourites is a dude who hovers around 40 viewers. What I found was that 90% of the streamers took more than a minute to respond to my chat. Two of them flat out didn't/couldn't respond at all, which was a swift exit for me.

Because of this shocking results, I couldn't help but appreciate the 10% who actively interacted with me, even more than I normally would. One of them took less than ten seconds to reply to any chat from the viewers. This rarity was an automatic follow from me, and whenever I get time, I'm going to prefer returning to that stream obviously. In order to avoid prejudice, I'm going to refrain from mentioning whether these streamers were big or small.

So the question I'd like to ask is: What challenges do you face when it comes to chat interaction? Because I doubt streamers are intentionally ignoring chat. I fully realize that another common comment has been that you get a viewer who leaves shortly without saying anything in chat. But let's consider that aspect out of scope for this discussion. Much smarter people than I have an answer to that question. But about the 20% of us who actively chat.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2fenas/what_do_you_think_of_streamers_who_dont_interact/) post is the closest I've found to the question I'm trying to pose, and the comments appear to suggest chat interaction is totally overrated. It's five years old, so might not be representative of the scene today.

Edit:

Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their valuable opinions. The common challenge seems to be maintaining a decent level of gameplay value whilst paying attention to chat. It appears that we, as streamers, make a decision, either consciously or subconsciously, about what balance we want to strike with our presentation. Some streamer value chat far above the game, while some feel it is not fair to prioritize chat as much as that, and they would like to provide a certain amount of gameplay, at the cost of a certain amount of chat interaction.

Another aspect seems to be about multitasking. One guy nailed it perfectly (I can't find that comment anymore), that just like everything else this multitasking - playing a game halfway decently, and paying attention to chat - is a skill, that can be developed. I think that's an amazing perspective. I hope it's not too late already, but I'd be very interested to develop this perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/d4y7e4/if_you_respond_to_chat_in_a_timely_manner_you_are/,1568625801.0,1316,0.97,186,Twitch,maelstrom1001

For me the Prime ad-free period ended about 10 days ago, and I am considering getting Turbo because this is just unbearable.

The ads are not varied because Twitch doesn't have the reach of Google, and I can't figure out how to make Ublock origin catch them (I am in NA West).

All of that mentioned, my point is that if Turbo is the way to block ads on Twitch, this will absolutely drive revenue away from streamers and into the pockets of Twitch - because I will likely give up my subs to streamers I enjoy watching so I can enjoy watching them without interruption.

d2z1c7,I love raiding small streamers.,"So. A little bit of context as to what my stream is about. I mostly stream a game called football manager, started streaming in November of 2018 and rapidly gained a following to the point where my streams get anywhere between 25 and 40 views on average.

Just because I play football manager mostly doesn't mean I won't play other games.

Sometimes we've ended on a round or two of geogussr. Now some of you may not know what geogussr is but it's worth a look.

Anyway, I normally raid someone either within the FM community or someone who's playing the same game that I ended on.

Twice now, ending on geogussr, I've raided other smaller English speaking geogussr streams.

Twice now my guys and gals have come through with the follows, the views and hung around to get these people to affiliate status. And it feels great. It genuinely feels great. And I want to do it more. I could go for the big boys and get my name known but as things stand I'm kinda getting close to the big boys in my chosen game.

Honestly, if you're a streamer doing decent numbers, spread the love. Get the new guys or smaller guys to affiliate. You'll be lost in a sea of chat if you raid a big name anyway. You'll feel good and so will they.

d2qn8g,Hide that viewer count,"No, I'm not talking about hiding the viewer count while streaming, rather about watching a stream.

My laptop screen is small enough that while watching streams there is only enough real estate for the video feed and chat, which means all the stream info and stats which are shown at the bottom of the player are initially hidden until I scroll down.

So I was watching this stream and enjoying the gameplay, commentary and discussion in chat. When I scrolled down to look at the info, I was shocked to find the viewer count at only 9. The chat activity was representative of a 50 viewer stream, in my experience. On the same note, I remembered being surprised to find a viewer count of 20+ on some other stream I checked out which had literally no chat activity, nor was the content interesting. Being the self-analytical person I am, I was quite surprised at being shocked in the first place.

Maybe it's just me, but I realized that perhaps we have preconceived notions about the quality of a stream based on the viewer count. It could be that because Twitch uses viewer count to rate and promote streams - because its unsophisticated algorithm has literally no better options - we as a community have imbibed the belief that this metric equates to quality, even if we don't acknowledge this consciously. Therefore, it is entirely possible that if you didn't know the viewer count of a stream beforehand, you might find that you enjoy some streamer who has 5 viewers more than some streamer who has 100. And vice versa too of course, which would be status quo.

I'm currently looking for a way to hide the viewer count. Apparently, it can be configured in the ad blocker. Regardless, with this self-awareness now, I'm going to try and watch any new streamer I come across with an open mind, instead of automatically assuming higher viewership must mean higher quality. And maybe, just maybe, I'll find a diamond in the dirt. I already discovered one of my favourite streamers when he was sitting at 0 viewers, but that was because he was streaming a dead game which I love to pieces.

Edit: Given the popularity of this post, the question I'd like to pose is

What has your experience been? How often have you been surprised that someone really entertaining had hardly any viewers, and someone dead ass boring had hundreds? As for the opposite scenario, there's really no surprise, is there.

For me, only one in ten small streamers I actually found entertaining. But, here's the kicker ... only one in ten big streamers I found entertaining. So, from my perspective it's come to a stage where the viewer count is completely meaningless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/d2qn8g/hide_that_viewer_count/,1568210541.0,365,0.88,93,Twitch,maelstrom1001
d2c3tv,Suggestion: Allow moderators to (visually) disable their moderator badge,"Hey everyone!

Alright, so I'm just gonna go ahead and post what I've already written in the Twitch Uservoice suggestion over [here](https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/297558-general/suggestions/38534413--visually-disable-moderator-badge):

&gt; Users are able to hide specific badges already (Twitch Prime, Turbo, Bits, ...) but what about Moderator Badges?

&gt; The reason for this suggestion:
In smaller streams (new) chatters might get scared if moderators post messages.

&gt; So I see 2 potential ways this could be achieved:

&gt; 1. Only visually disable the mod badge (keeping the moderation actions in-tact)
2. Allow moderator to go into ""non-moderation mode"" - in this mode, the moderation actions are not available and they are like a normal chatter

&gt; In both cases moderators should still show up in the Moderator List (/mods).

&gt; Recently Twitch added a ""Mod View"" into the chat settings - maybe something could be added in there?
Say a ""Hide Moderator Badge"" option?

What do you guys think of this?

Do you think this could be beneficial to not just small streamers but potentially also bigger ones, too?

czzvyv,Streamed for almost an entire year - Here are my results.,"A small preface, I started streaming November 2018 mainly streaming niche games as I am no pro gamer. I moved to a different city to pursue my ""dream"" - I know it was not the smartest decision but I wanted to do it anyway to see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

After all this time of streaming I've accumulated about 300 followers and 8-15 subs depending on the month. My streams would accumulate about 20-50 unique views per stream. Most of them were people who were already following me most like. I've made around 350$ in subs/bits. Overall it was a fun journey but I'm deciding to quit now as I've used up most of my life saving and I'm in a near depressive state as I was very optimistic when I begun this journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Twitch is an amazing platform but I feel like it's extremely difficult to ""make"" it at this point in time, by make it I mean making it as a full time streamer.

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming is an amazing experience but if you have high expectations it can be very soul crushing. There will be days where you will have no viewers because they will be at work or doing someone else, some days you will wonder why are people watching other people over you and stuff like that, I wish I could say it was just a hobby but I invested more than I'm willing to admit so yeah here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried to keep this as short as possible as I'm not a fan of writing massive wall of texts, I'm willing to answer any questions you guys may have. If anyone has any similar experiences I'd love to hear from you.

cyby1u,"I’m trying to build a giveaway tool for stream communities, rather than fake users and “prize zombies”","Hi all! For the last year I’ve been working hard on a side project called [Kick](https://www.kick.gg), with the help of some great streamers who have been testing for me. I’m finally excited to share it with the r/Twitch community! 

*Link*: https://www.kick.gg

Kick spawned from my frustration with giveaways, and how streamers use them to boost social media channels - only to have a bunch of fake accounts follow them, or people who simply don’t care about anything other than the prize (I like to call them “prize zombies”). We all know what I'm talking about!

I wanted to create a tool that allowed streamers to run giveaways (like Gleam), but also provided a mechanism to put **genuine community members at a big advantage**.

I’ve done this through a feature called “Chat Multipliers”. Every entrant to your giveaway gets a multiplier from 1-5x. The more days they’re detected engaging in your Twitch chat or Discord server, the higher their multiplier rises.

Ultimately, I would like to be able to build a tool that helps streamers leverage some of the power &amp; excitement of Gleam style giveaways, but in a way that has its motives and incentives better aligned. Not sure this is possible, but having a shot!

For example, one of my great test users Brihtwulf, runs a monthly giveaway focused on rewarding his community; while this does result in new people coming in, the main focus of each campaign is to create an exciting experience for his fanbase. These are the people I’d love to use Kick, rather than people looking for cheap Twitter/Twitch followers.

Because this is a side project for me, and it takes up a lot of my time as well as having costs - I have a limited free plan, but most of the juice is available on the paid plan ($19 a month). I like to think that the tool’s target market are streamers who are interested in investing in their community :) For this long awaited r/Twitch launch, I’ve created a link that allows 10 people to get it for $10/m forever! Just have to purchase the streamer plan subscription through here: https://gum.co/knMTY/3n3072l

I’ve also created a demo giveaway so you can get an idea of what one looks like: https://my.kick.gg/c/27/kick-launch

Important for me to note that Kick is very much a WIP - I expect to see bugs, and really appreciate whenever they’re reported to me!

Someone purchased bits worth over 120 euro's onto my account! I changed my password straight away and added more security features to my account

But is there a way to check to see who you gave bits too so I can see where the bits went?

If i open my current amount of Bits its says I have ""2"" bits remaining.

And its weird it says the purchase was done thru xSolla because I never use this service besides Twitch Turbo(?)

**EDIT:**

**OP here, quick update!**

I've been mailing with Twitch Support and they cancelled the bit purchases after a few hours I've mailed them (Thank you Twitch for the quick response!) and they are fully refunding all purchases made within in the screenshots proof I've send them.

I've added more security to my account so this won't be happening again (hopefully). I've changed my password on every platform to a password with a long hash to make it extra secure. I've also added 2FA authentications to plenty of my accounts on several platforms to make sure I'm EXTRA secured.

Also I started to use KeePass to save all my passwords in a database on my computer to make sure I can always have acces to my passwords.

I want to thank all of you for suggestions and information! I hope this doesn't happen again because it really shocked me for a bit. And for everyone else.. secure your accounts. Enable 2FA to make sure people won't access your account.

Also I hope that someone with identical problems like me in this case can get his stuff sorted out by this thread with all the information given by all the members on this subreddit.

cu8bxu,"I've streamed twice, no one watched, and I'm absolutely in love with it","I'm someone who has always wanted to stream. So after a recent bonus from work, I went and picked up a new webcam, got OBS set up, and started streaming. Tonight, I did my second 3-hour stream. I've had no one but bots in the chat. It's just been a couple of friends and I playing rust. 

But I absolutely love streaming.

It's not because I'm hoping people start watching. I've always wanted to do it because it seems fun. I make comments and conversation with the nonexistent audience out there. Then, afterwards, i get to go back and genuinely enjoy rewatching gaming sessions with friends.

I don't have any fancy channel art. It's a pretty low cost production. But just watching myself back and seeing me and the game I'm playing on screen genuinely makes me feel like I've finally started doing something that will make gaming even more fun, and something that I've always admired and wanted to do.

I dont know why I felt it neccesary to share, but I guess most people I talk to want subs and money and big viewership. So I guess I just wanted to share that streaming can be extremely rewarding without all that. At the end of the stream, it's way more fun to just kick back with buddies and feel like you might be entertaining even just one person out there.

I'm going to be going at it again sunday doing some live blender modelling to make some cool channel art and animations, and I can't wait!

cs1bii,Upgrade Your Microphone Quality (using Reaper Plugins - works with all mics inc. Blue Yeti/Snowball etc.),"#[FULL VIDEO GUIDE!](https://youtu.be/2MfY36FrYSE)

#INTRODUCTION

This is a beginners guide to processing your microphone audio. This will work no matter what kind of microphone you use, including popular USB mics like the Blue Yeti, Razer Siren etc. Note: I am not an audio engineer at all, so feel free to give your take or correct any info.

It's also worth mentioning that that most important things you can do to improve your microphones audio will be to (1) make sure that you are using correct microphone position and technique (e.g. you are speaking directly into the microphone's capsule about 4-6 inches from your mouth) and (2) you've done your best to treat your streaming environment. You don't need anything crazy like acoustic panels but at least make sure you've done your best to get rid of background noise like PC fans and that you've put some furniture in your room to stop excess reverb. These two things alone will be way more important than anything else in this guide.

OBS Studio has built in support for VST plugins, which are essentially addons that you can use to process your vocals to either improve the quality or add effects. We'll be using VST plugins to set up an audio chain as follows (in order):

* Noise Suppression (avoid this if possible, more on that later)  
* Noise Gate  
* Equalization  
* Compression  

I will be providing some settings that I have used for a cheap generic chinese microphone called the BM800 which can regularly be bought for about $20. Feel free to use these settings as a starting point for your own mic.

#WHAT YOU'LL NEED

Reaper Plugins ► [Here](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/)  

Reaper Plugins is a suite of free VST plugins. Just install the 64-bit version from the link about and install it to the **default** install location. Do not change this as OBS searches for a specific location for VST plugins and if you change it, OBS won't be able to find them.

#ADDING A VST PLUGIN

1. Click on the cog next to your microphone then go to *Filters*  
2. Click on the + symbol and select *VST 2.x Plug-in*
3. Click the drop down and select your VST of choice (see following sections)

Note: While you are adding VST plugins, you can monitor your audio by going to Edit &gt; Advanced Audio Properties then *Monitor Only (mute output)* or *Monitor and Output* for your mic.

#NOISE SUPPRESSION

*Add a ReaFir Standalone*  

ReaFir is a plugin that takes a sample of your background noise and subtracts it from your vocals. This is a really great option if you simply have too much background noise that you can't remove for whatever reason. **Note that the more background noise you have, the more this filter will degrade the quality of your audio so if you can avoid using it altogether, that would be ideal. I've included this step anyway for anyone that simply can't get rid of background noise any other way.**

1. Select *Subtract* from the dropdown
2. Check *Automatically build noise profile*. ReaFir will listen to your background noise while the checkmark is checked, so uncheck it after about 5 seconds.

Settings used for the BM800 [here](https://i.imgur.com/CiC1A91.png):

    Type: Subtract

#NOISE GATE

*Add a ReaGate Standalone plugin*

ReaGate is a plugin that simply shuts off your mic below a set volume threshold, then turns it on once it goes above that threshold.

1. On the left, you will see a meter moving up and down. Set your threshold to be just above where this meter moves up to.
2. Adjust the attack and release times. Your attack time is how quickly the noise gate reacts to your voice and your release time is how long the gate should stay open after you've stopped talking. Use a short attack time (~3ms) but use a longer release time (~100ms) as using too fast of a release time will result in some of your sentences being cut off too quickly.

Settings used for the BM800 [here](https://i.imgur.com/Xw9HWC4.png):

    Threshold: -40db
    Attack: 2ms
    Release: 100ms
    Everything Else: Default

#EQUALIZATION

*Add a ReaEQ Standalone plugin*

ReaEQ is a plugin that allows you to equalize your audio. You can use this plugin to adjust the any frequency to add some bass/mids/treble to your vocals. The range of human hearing is from 20Hz to 20kHz, so to equalize your vocals we will need to select which frequencies within that range that we want to boost/attenuate and tell ReaEQ how it should boost those frequencies.  

For simplicity's sake, I have set up a 10-band EQ. That is, we will be adding 10 different frequencies to our EQ and adjusting them. Hardware mixers like the GoXLR use 10-band EQ, so this should be plenty to experiment with. You will need to play around with the gain on your own, as everybody has a different voice and will require different EQ settings.

1. To add a frequency, Click *Add Band*
2. For each frequency, adjust the *Gain (db)*
3. Change the type to *Band* (unless otherwise stated)

I've left some notes given to me by a user named coffeeratmedia for how to adjust each frequency.

    Cutting at 80Hz to 100Hz to remove low rumble and to take off proximity effect from the voice 
    150Hz and 300Hz for boosting base sound / adding back proximity effect 
    Reduce areas 500Hz and below to get rid of muddy voice
    800Hz -1kHz lower it to reduce the nasil in your voice
    3.5kHz boost for clarity
    Hard/ash s’s 4kHz to 9kHz so lower it down
    10kHz+ to add or degrease air

Settings used for the BM800 [here](https://i.imgur.com/5HCwYKR.png):

    32Hz: +0 db (Set type to *High pass*)
    64Hz: +3 db
    125Hz: +6 db
    250Hz: +2 db
    500Hz: -2 db
    1kHz: -1 db
    2kHz: +3 db
    4kHz: +3 db
    8kHz: -1 db
    16kHz: -1 db (Set type to *Low Pass*)

#COMPRESSION

*Add a ReaComp Standalone plugin*

ReaComp is a plugin that squashes the loudest parts and quietest parts of your vocals together so that you get more consistent audio levels. If you tend to scream a lot on your stream, compression can be very helpful. The way compression works is by setting a volume threshold *and* a ratio.

For example, if you set a compression ratio of 4:1, every 4db of audio that you pass through your mic will be squashed down to 1db for your viewers, but only *above* the threshold that you set. Your goal should be to ensure that you do not peak and blow your viewer's ears out.

1. Set your threshold (around -24db works well for me)
2. Adjust the attack and release times (these work similarly to the attack and release times for noise gate)
3. Set your ratio (around 2:1 to 3:1 works as a starting point, use more if you prefer a more aggressively compressed sound)

Settings used for the BM800 [here](https://i.imgur.com/4ltGTZb.png):

    Threshold: -24db
    Ratio: 2.5:1
    Attack: 2ms
    Release: 30ms
    Everything Else: Default

#FINAL WORDS

Your vocals should be sounding much better than the default settings. Make sure to play around with the EQ settings and try to get an understanding of how changing each frequency changes the sound of your vocals. It is also possible to use Reaper plugins globally on all programs in Windows by using a program called Equalizer APO, but that will have to be for another post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cs1bii/upgrade_your_microphone_quality_using_reaper/,1566135702.0,1313,0.98,113,Twitch,nutella4eva
cru8o3,How is the App So Bad?,"If somebody messages me, the start of the notification sound pauses my twitch video, and the end of the notification sound unpauses my twitch video.

Which means that, if I pause a twitch video, like bc a work meeting is starting and I put my headphones away, and at any point somebody messages me -- even if I have my phone silenced so the notification doesn't make any noise, that not will unpause my twitch video and it'll start blaring.

I've never seen a smartphone app handle notifications worse. I've literally never seen an app before where I can close the app, go into the notification pull-down on my phone and click the ""x"" to make the background audio turn off and go away, and then 12 hours later while I'm sleeping somebody will email me and BOOM IT'S PLAYING AGAIN.

How is this still a thing? How. How is this still a thing? How, I need answers.

crihtk,What does everyone here think about the idea of twitch Partners and affiliates being allowed to vote on changes to the TOS of twitch?,"This is just an idea that drifts in and out of my mind from time to time. Let's make an unrefined example.

 I don't know anyone who would do this but let's say, for whatever dumb reason, a twitch partner suddenly suggests that suddenly streaming any images, visual depictions of, or actual pieces of Pizza will get you a suspension on Twitch. This gains enough traction so then we see twitch staff emailing all partners and Affiliates to vote on this issue. everyone takes a vote. If enough people vote for it then the rule passes and then putting Pizza on stream will be punishable. If not then nothing changes.

Partners and Affiliates should have the same voting weight. I'm pretty sure all of the non-partnered  affiliate streamers have the same amount of stake in twitch as the top 5 streamers combined.

 What do you guys think of implementing a system like this?

EDIT: let's add some specifics and rules for voting.

To be eligible to vote you must have streamed a particular number of hours within the past 90 days on Twitch. Under this type of scenario I would be ineligible for voting. This is also a good idea to prevent things like vote manipulation Vietnam twitch platforms like Discord YouTube and Twitter. While I understand that you may think that becoming an affiliate is already difficult, I've read posts that say if you join a follow4follow group or a host for host group then it really isn't difficult to get affiliate status at all. Regardless don't join those groups. It won't help you.

Streamers will receive notice of what issues to vote for 24 hours before the vote begins. The time frame to vote will last 24 hours. in the same stroke a partner or affiliate may not mention what he or she will vote for or has voted for for 24 hours in advance or after voting. The streamer may also not show the voting process on stream.  this is to prevent brigading. Doing so will revoke the streamers right to vote on future issues. It may also result in temporary suspension. If you have any better specific suggestions here just post them and I might add them to this paragraph.

cr1a9i,Streaming with Ryzen 3900x - First impressions,"\- Using latest BIOS ( F42A ), latest chipset drivers

\- Upgraded from 2700x to 3900x

**Full specs:**

[https://setuplog.io/setup/NA1YPVZ2/my-gaming-setup](https://setuplog.io/setup/NA1YPVZ2/my-gaming-setup)

**Here are my first impressions:**

\- While gaming, while there is no difference between SMT on/off, there is a difference in gaming + streaming performance  if you use Lasso to make sure the game only uses CCD0 and OBS only CCD1.

\- Reducing used threads resulted in higher framerates in BF1. Limiting the game to 6 threads resulted in higher boost clocks on the cores that were being used ( less thermal throttling ). Youtube movies that do 4 vs 6 vs 8 core comparisons could be very misleading for current and future 3900x owners since they are mostly run on Intel CPU's with the exact same clockspeed in every test.

\- Memory that was previously maxed out at CL16-18-18-38 3000Mhz and needed 1.4V to remain stable on the 2700x is now running at CL16-16-16-36 3200Mhz at 1.35V. I finally get the memory speed I payed for more then a year ago.

\- VRM Temperature is around 75°C while gaming Battlefield 1 + Streaming on slow preset. VRM temperatur can reach up to 100°C while stressing the CPU. Offcourse this does not represent actual workloads.

\- FPS in Battlefield 1 is only 17% faster while streaming ( 1440P, custom settings ), but most importantly, 1% lows are 25% faster while streaming and this is medium ( 2700x ) vs slow ( 3900x ) preset in OBS. A-ma-zing!

\- Upgrading was as easy as updating bios + chipset and replacing CPU. One issue though, Ryzen Master did not work after 3900x was installed. Deinstallation + reïnstallation did not fix the issue. A manual fix in Windows register was needed in order to fix Ryzen Master start-up issue.

\- My 3DMark Timespy Ultra score is only 100 points higher then with my 2700x. CPU usage was only 50-56% during CPU test. No idea how to force 3DMark to bench it correcly.

\- Now that I have the 3900x I am able to game without big framedrops + stream custom high quallity X264  preset on 720p + record 1440p gameplay all on the same machine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cr1a9i/streaming_with_ryzen_3900x_first_impressions/,1565929535.0,285,0.95,111,Twitch,JRMBelgium

cqdwm1,"I upgraded my computer, but my stream quality got worse","I don't understand. 

I have my bitrate set to between 2000 and 2500. My processor is a Ryzen 2750x, my graphics card is a Radeon 5700XT. I upgraded from a samsung series 7 gamer that had ZERO issues, but every time I try to stream it's constant buffering, dropped frames, and other issues. I hate it, it's ruining this for me. 

It has to be something to do with my internet connection but I can't understand what changed when it's the same connection I had on my other computer.


More info: 

I was initially using 6000 for my bitrate. I changed it to 2500 because I thought that sending less information might help. I was mistaken though as you all have pointed out, bitrate only affected the people watching. 

I have a friend who I stream with. Some days we stream together, some days I just hang out in discord talking with him and watching his stream to make sure there's no issues, other days he does the same for me. He's the one that said it was lagging/buffering. There was no issue with audio, just video. In addition, he checked his internet speed and it said it was fast, rather than typical or slow, so the bitrate change was completely unnecessary.

While this can inflict an enormous amount of damage, he did seem to be fine (apart from a few light bruises).

The streamer later said it was ""in all good"", but I can't seem to grasp the idea of wanting to potentially hurt someone for comedic effect. Especially not a kid. I know people might be eager to get a bigger following, but putting yourself in danger is not a good way to achieve that.

It's scary to see that people commenting on a tweet made by the guy who told him seems to be totally fine with this. They're even calling this_vid, a Twitter bot that saves the chosen video so you can download it later.

&amp;nbsp;

While I understand that StreamLabs is a business and needs to make money, this change is not for the better. [While the new minimum merch prices are lower because of this change](https://gyazo.com/cd1554b63d8247cdfc904fe2f9ece741), this will ultimately hurt smaller creators that now have to set aside enough profit from merch &amp; donations (or fund it themselves) just to be able to keep selling/adding/changing products, and they will likely move to other platforms . I'd personally have the old business model implemented as a free tier for the merch: a higher minimum price on all products, meaning more money going to StreamLabs per purchase, in exchange for not locking the merch platform behind a subscription. This would still leave Prime users the ability to sell for lower, while not preventing smaller creators from utilizing the platform in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

The most disappointing thing about this change is that there was no announcement/heads up to creators that this change was even happening. I had to go through the support site to find out after the fact, [with multiple users having no idea why they can no longer add new designs](https://howto.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-merch-12). A little over a month ago they put a blog out which included this graphic [Why Streamlabs Merch is Better](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yiTil3wElzF1bJoYNJnFsw.png) stating it's availability to everyone as an advantage (sure at the time of posting it *was* available to everyone but I doubt they didn't already know internally about the subscription change), and *just 4 days ago* they uploaded [Streamlabs Merch Store - Increase Your Revenue and Build Your Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FJNIQiwH8I), stating that ""StreamLabs Merch is the best option for creators who want fully customized merch with no middleman and no extra fees"". Funny they didn't mention the $12/mo subscription fee needed to use it in the first place. 

&amp;nbsp;

I liked the Streamlabs Merch because they have good products, a decent design editor, and good Twitch integration compared to my experience with DesignByHumans, Spreadshirt, or TeeSpring, but this new business model doesn't seem to be for the benefit of creators, and I hope some compromise can be made before users leave for other platforms.

cmow6b,The future of Twitch is shaked by other streaming platforms?,"Because money can easly decide the fate of almost everything that surrounds us and this fact was proven a few days ago, I wonder how the future of Twitch will look like? From my point of view it will mainly remain the same because it was the first streaming platform that encourages thousands of gamers to express themselves online and offline. On the other hand, it is very hard for new gamers to compete with the ""meta"" of Twitch in every category that is out there. I think people opt to move from Twitch because they might be exposed much better, which is very hard to get on the Amazon Platform. 

Twitch announced at some point that they will implement a strategy that will help small gamers to be more exposed in the plaform under the form of a new ""line"" category on the front page, while Mixer has a very cool feature implemented that focuses on games that are close to be completed: 5 remaining teams in an Apex Legends game. They are promoting the most exciting part of the game that is reflected by a lot of players in close real time.

cmeqxk,"Some cooky ""girl"" joined my stream and I'm not sure how to handle it.","I'm a pretty small (and relatively new) streamer with a handful of followers and a couple people watching during my streams. Nothing too crazy so when someone makes a presence and starts chatting, it's pretty apparent and hard to ignore. 

I was streaming earlier today and this girl joins my stream and sends a follow saying how she's really been enjoying my stream so far. Cool, I always like engaging people who take the time to check out my stream. She's asking what I like to play, how long I've been playing for etc.

 Fast forward 15 minutes and she's starting to get pretty flirty which put me in an awkward situtation bc im not going to flirt with some random person on the internet on my own stream. I don't even know what this person looks like or if they're even a girl lol. I check out her channel and there's no vods or streaming activity on her end and her profile picture looks pretty cat-fishey imo. At this point im 75% sure it's a dude that's flirting on my stream to get some weird reaction from me. 

Because I don't have a huge following, I can't really ignore ""her"" flirty chats and also don't want to make my other viewers uncomfortable. In the odd case this person actually is a girl and is genuinely flirting, I don't want to make her feel bad/awkward by telling her I'm not interested during the stream. Since I'm pretty new to streaming, I'm not too sure what my options are. Suggestions?

Edit: 
Wow can’t believe all the help and suggestions I got, you guys are the best! I decided that if she joins the stream and starts flirting again, I’ll extend my flattery but explain that I’m not down for that kind of chat during my stream.

cl5kky,Fake Donations,"Welp, here we go. Lastnight I was streaming to maybe 4 people and 2 people entered and started chatting and asking questions. They proceeded to donate small amounts of money and I was excited as this was my first donations. That being said I wasn't OVERLY excited because I know about charge backs and fake donations, etc. I was very thankful but cautious and even more skeptical considering SLOBS didn't show any mention of donations and my stream alerts didn't go off. I politely thanked them, eventually they ""donated"" almost 1300$ combined, then left the stream. I assume they left since I wasn't overbearingly excited and freaking out. Obviously nothing showed up in paypal and it was all fake as I suspected.

The part I find even worse about this fake donation from 2 strangers is I checked their twitch profiles after my stream and saw they went and followed about 8 more streams after mine in only about 45 minutes. I can only assume they were going around making fake donations to small streamers and both accounts were less than 2 months old. As someone who is aware of fake donations I was slightly irritated but I knew what to expect. My biggest problem here is not everyone knows about the trolling and ""/me"" text donations. Any donation really could have meant a lot to someone who was unsuspecting and honestly 1300$ could make a big big life difference for someone down on their luck. For someone to give them a sliver of hope and then strip it away is pretty discouraging to someone who's already down and out.

Can I ask why people think its funny to boost their ego while really just being dicks to strangers who are just trying to entertain their community? Its seems to me these accounts were made truly just to be trolls and its probably two fifteen year old kids who think their the funniest kids on earth but ultimately its bad for the community and in the end what did you really accomplish?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Don't make fake donations, they shit on people who are trying to make the dream work. Go read a book if you'rebored.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cl5kky/fake_donations/,1564759591.0,650,0.93,137,Twitch,MalevolentPanda_TTV

cjrwiy,"I got affiliate last night!!! Now I have some work to do, and I am looking for suggestions","So, I was pretty close to affiliate to begin with when I started the stream: 2.5/3 viewers in a 30 day span, and thats the only requirement I was missing.  I was just getting ready to end the stream, and someone raided me with 50ish viewers!  So I went ahead and streamed another hour to really bond with those that stuck around.  A few were really excited about the content I was making, and I think I gained a few regulars in the process!  

But now, I have some work to do: I need to spruce up my stream and really make it a community that people really want to be involved with and support.  So with that, I am looking for suggestions.  Its a little overwhelming all that I have access to now, so I am hoping there is a ""guide"" or ""checklist"" of things to make sure my stream has, especially for Subscribers. 

I know of the following things:

* Badges for consecutive subscribers
* Emotes, as well as special emotes for subscribers (thanks u/teahands for setting realistic expectations here)

What else am I missing?  Does anyone have any suggestions that they really felt worked well for them?  

The following list of things are things I am planning to do.  If there is something here that is a bad idea, I'd be happy to hear it.

* Suggestion box - I want viewers to feel like they have some control over what my community provides to them.  So I plan to have a link to a google poll where people can anonymously submit their suggestions and ideas for the stream
* A ""We'll be right back"" screen - bathroom breaks and stream interruptions
* Transitions for when I switch scenes on OBS
* Re-arrange my layout a bit to include space for a bit boss and maybe a bit cup
* Supporter Leaderboard or a Supporter banner - I am on the fence about this one...I know people like to have recognition for their support, but I also don't want to make my stream all about the support; its about making content that people want to support, not the support itself. Thoughts?
* A full list of upgrades that supporting the channel will contribute to - People like to know how their support is used, and I want people to know what their donations and subs are going towards, and to feel like they had an impact in helping the community to grow.  So I plan to have a full list of sort of ""tiered"" upgrades that I already know I want to make to my streaming set up.
* Updated bio to include channel rules, more detailed about me, etc
* A bot for commands
* Expand streamelements to include other alerts besides follow and raids, spruce up existing alerts (thanks u/TheAlphaWolf1997 for the suggestion)
* Create an Instagram account (thanks u/pointcrow for the suggestion)
* Update Youtube account for VOD uploads (thanks u/pointcrow for the suggestion)
* Restart my Discord (thanks u/pointcrow for the suggestion)
* Automated/timed messages (thanks u/joannes3000 for the suggestion)
* Streamelements Live Auto-Tweet (thanks u/joannes3000 for the suggestion)
* Custom offline screen (thanks u/TheAlphaWolf1997 for the suggestion)
* IRL Overlay (thanks u/TheAlphaWolf1997 for the suggestion)
* Bit Badges (thanks u/TheAlphaWolf1997 for the suggestion)

I appreciate your feedback!  I plan to have a super long Stream on Friday to celebrate becoming affiliate, ~~and I want to make sure I have the stream fully upgraded before then!~~ So I want to get as much quality additions made as I can.

~~Edit: I edited the post to remove the list of things that I was planning to do already; it was partly to have a to-do list in one location, but also to make the list visible for people offer feedback on individual items that are bad ideas and to avoid. But apparently that is looked down on or something.  *shrug*~~

Edit 2:  I made the assumption that it was assumed, but I want to clarify: I do not mention subscribers with any sort of delusion that just because I am affiliate, they will come rolling in now.  All references made to subs and bits is from the frame of reference of channel building, so that the infrastructure for these things is already there when they eventually happen and are earned.

Edit 3:  This post has been a wild ride, haha.  I was requested to restore the original condition of the post...which I did, for the most part; I reworded somethings to make it clear I am not looking for people to build my stream for me.  Also added others' suggestions and credited the suggestor.  Most of the comments have been very informative and I appreciate those that took the time to make suggestions; I have learned a ton!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cjrwiy/i_got_affiliate_last_night_now_i_have_some_work/,1564493962.0,510,0.87,143,Twitch,StaticasaurusRex
cjdtpl,"How to build your brand on Twitch, and get more ""sticky"" followers.","Hey everyone. I wanted to drop in and recommend a book! I am a marketer by trade, and do some content here and there, but whenever any streamer talks about what they do on Twitch, it's usually through the lens of a ""game"" as opposed to what their unique personality and community is like. And you're going to find people are going to want to stick around if you have a sticky ""brand"" or community that is easy to understand!

So that being said, here's a summary of [my favorite branding book PrimalBranding](https://www.amazon.com/Primalbranding-Create-Zealots-Company-Future/dp/1451655312) (which has changed how I look at content branding forever).

&amp;#x200B;

It's broken up into these main seven components. If you have something for each of these categories, you'll have a solid brand that people can point to and say ""hey.. they're unique!"" and will want to come back to your channel:

1. **Creation** **Story** \- How did you get to where you are now? What is unique about your history, and how did it make you who you are? What did you overcome, and how did you succeed? I like to frame it in ""present, past, and future"".
2. **Creed** \- This is your set of beliefs. It's what sets you apart from others. If you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. So what do you believe in? It can be as simple as ""pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza"".
3. **Icons** \- What things activate the senses for your audience? What does your icon evoke? What emotions do your emotes create? What does your music do to connect your audience to you? etc etc etc. ""The human brain has evolved to look for meaning in a sequence of events."" Humans look for meaning and relative situations. That's why icons work.
4. **Rituals** \- What are the things you do over and over that become icons of their own? It could be the way you welcome someone to your stream, or what you do when someone subscribes to your channel?
5. **Nonbelievers** \- These are the people who do NOT believe in your Creed. They're the people who you disagree with, and might disagree with you. It creates the ""special club"" for you and your audience.
6. **Sacred Words** \- These are the codes that you and your community share. One of the most iconic Sacred Words branding I can think of is Starbucks renaming Small, Medium, and Large to Tall, Grande, Venti. When you say those words, people know it's Starbucks. And if they don't, then knowing the code puts YOU in a special club. You don't know what a ""Chug Jug"" is? Pfffft....
7. **The Leader** \- That's you. People tie YOU to the brand you've created. You're another icon and connection for people. You can either be you, or an impression of you.

&amp;#x200B;

And all of this connects to this idea of **Primal Belonging.** That everyone wants to feel like they're part of a family, group, or tribe. ""It's much more fun to be a part of something big"". If I enter into chat, and everyone recognizes who I am, that's a great feeling, yeah?

Anyway, that's a really good way to figure out what your ""branding"" is besides just the colors of your panels or emotes. What makes people feel an emotional attachment to you. That's what you should be trying to do to build your audience. The game doesn't matter as much as YOU matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cjdtpl/how_to_build_your_brand_on_twitch_and_get_more/,1564418785.0,627,0.92,89,Twitch,taylorishere
cj43ep,Any streamers on here that are introverted?,"I’m thinking about streaming to help become less introverted and be more social. To talk more, develop my small talk, and be more social in general. I’m not shy or insecure, I just burn up my “social energy” really quickly and don’t seek out social situations. I work in sales which requires me to talk almost constantly but not about a topic that I enjoy, and by the end of the day I just feel burned out. I’m hoping streaming will help “calibrate” my social energy so that I can be more successful in social situations. 


How have you adjusted to streaming? 


Does your chat always ask “why are you so quiet?” Even when I feel like I’m being extra social IRL people still comment about how I don’t talk much. Does being introverted come across on stream for you?

ciw43p,5 Stream Deck Alternatives!,"#[FULL VIDEO GUIDE!](https://youtu.be/P73EqEBVbfs)

#INTRODUCTION

For those of you who don't know what a Stream Deck is, the Stream Deck is a basically a macro pad that programmable buttons where each button has a seaprate display. The product is made by Elgato and they make them in three different sizes ranging from $100 all the way up to $250. If you're new to streaming, your money is probably best spent somewhere else.

I tried five alternatives to the Stream Deck summarized the pros/cons for each and whether or not I think you should use them. Also, if you already have a Stream Deck, I still think it's worth checking some of these out as they can all work along side your Stream Deck to give you even more buttons if you need them

#[Stream Deck Mobile](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck-mobile)

$2.99/month OR $24.99/year (App only available for iOS)

* + The most authentic Stream Deck experience (obviously, it's made by Elgato)  
* + Works exactly the same way a normal Stream Deck does  
* + Great for people that want to eventually get a Stream Deck  
* + Can be used alongside a physical Stream Deck  
* + Works with other Elgato products like the Key Light  
* + Works wirelessly  
* - Requires a monthly subscription  
* - Could do much more  

This one was pretty straightforward, the app works literally the same as an actual Stream Deck and even uses the same software. I would recommend this if you eventually plan to get a Stream Deck because all the buttons you have configured transfer over flawlessly. That being said, I really wish Elgato utilized the touch screen to do things that a physical Stream Deck can't, like adjusting mic volume or page swiping but I get it. Their strategy is to give you a taste of what the Stream Deck can do so that you give in and buy the real thing later down the line. It's a smart business strategy, but would be cool.



#[StreamLabs OBS Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.streamlabs.slobsrc&amp;hl=en_AU)

Free (App available for Android and iOS)

* + Extremely easy to setup
* + Very fluid interface
* + All your buttons are automatically setup
* - Only works with StreamLabs OBS
* - Buttons cannot be customized
* - Only supports simple scene switching/source toggling

This one was by far the easiest to setup. You just open the app, scan a QR code in SLOBS and it automatically sets up all the buttons for each of your scenes and sources. It has buttons for streaming/recording, muting your mic/desktop audio, switching between scenes and toggling sources in SLOBS. Unfortunately there is essentially no customization at all so you can't add or remove buttons and you can't put labels on your buttons. If you use SLOBS and just want something to work right away, StreamLabs OBS Remote is okay.


#[Deckboard](https://electronjs.org/apps/deckboard)

Free w/ ads OR $4.99 (App only available for Android)

* + Paid version supports up to 30 buttons per page
* + Twitch, Twitter, Spotify Integration
* + Very intuitive, closest to the real Stream Deck experience imo
* + Can make custom icons and animated gifs
* + Page swiping is SUPER awesome (why does no other app do this?!)
* + Multiple pages
* + Ability to set custom background colors
* + Vertical and horizontal orientations
* + Extension support
* + Ads are very unintrusive on the free version
* - Free version only supports 4x3 layouts (not so bad)
* - No font customization
* - Icons don't change to indicate that a source/scene is active, recording/streaming is live
* - Twitch integration only includes the bare minimum (can't do things like change your stream title or create a clip)
* - Can't mute audio on audio sources, only your mic and desktop audio

As far as Stream Deck *clones* go, this one actually does a really good job although it's missing a few features that the Stream Deck has. That being said, all the core features that I really need are available. Also, the fact that the paid version has twice as many buttons as the Stream Deck is super awesome especially if you use a lot a scenes and sources like I do.

The software is as easy to use as the Stream Deck software or at the very least, it's close. I actually still use Deckboard even though I have a Stream Deck. Far exceeded my expectations, that's for sure.

Edit: Just want to make a quick correction about Deckboard. Ravi (the developer) has contacted informing me that he just released an update two days ago which includes *Stream Markers*.


 
#[Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com/)

Free OR $8.99 (App available for Android and iOS)

* + Twitch/Twitter integration (including features like setting stream Markers and creating Clips!)
* + Paid version supports a massive 7x15 grid (Over three times as many as the Stream Deck XL!)
* - Free version only supports 4x2 layouts and 2 pages (okay but less than Deckboard)
* - Interface is a little more clumsy than Deckboard
* - Page navigation is very annoying

This one is one that I had high hopes for since it's the app that seems to be the most recommended. The software is okay and once you've set up all your buttons, it works really well. It's technically got more features than Deckboard, but the interface is a little bit more clunky and hard to navigate.  

It was pretty easy for me to make pages that didn't work because if you make a page, it doesn't automatically create a back button for you. That means if you go into a page, you have no way of navigating out of it unless you manually created a back page button. This was super frustrating and I honestly don't know how people haven't pointed this out (at least of all the people that recommended I try it).  

Perhaps I missed something, but if some of these UI quirks can be ironed out, Touch Portal can be a really strong alternative. It's also probably the best app on this list if you need a ridiculous number of buttons and want to use it with a tablet. Nothing comes close to offering as many buttons as Touch Portal.


 
#[HIDMacros (A.K.A Using an actual keyboard. Yes, really)](http://www.hidmacros.eu/)

Free (Not available on Android and iOS for obvious reasons)

* + Tactile feedback
* + Works with hardware you probably already have
* + Can make a giant macro pad or a tiny macro pad, it's up to you
* + Permanent setup, always available when you need it
* - Setup is clunky
* - Don't have dynamic icons on the buttons
* - Doesn't integrate with OBS natively, need to rig up each button as a hotkey

This one requires a separate keyboard/number pad and using HIDMacros to set up macros for each button. HIDMacros is necessary so your computer can recognise inputs from different keyboards e.g. if I press ""1"" on my macropad, it's not going to interfere with ""1"" on my main keyboard.

I used to recommend this option a few years back before any of these apps even existed. Now that these apps do exist, I haven't been recommending it as often but it's still a nice option if you want something permanent and don't want to pull out your phone to use it.



#CONCLUSION

I was actually really surprised how well each of these apps worked. I came in with low expectations but every one of these apps has their own legitimate use case. I would say:

* Use the Stream Deck app if you think you'll eventually buy a real Stream Deck  
* Use StreamLabs OBS Remote if you're lazy and just want something up and running quickly and easily  
* Use Deckboard if you want something close the Stream Deck experience without spending a lot of money  
* Use Touch Portal if you need a crap load of buttons and want to use it with something like a tablet (and are okay with putting up with the clunky software)  
* HIDMacros if you want a permanent setup that you always have access too (and you like tactile buttons)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ciw43p/5_stream_deck_alternatives/,1564322304.0,145,0.92,24,Twitch,nutella4eva

Luckily I keep my personal and twitch instagrams separate so he cant harass my family or friends but what am I supposed to do here?

4kkbta,Best. Stream. EVER.,"I've been streaming on and off for about eight months now, but I only started streaming regularly (4 days a week at the same time each day!) a few weeks ago. 

At the start of the month I'd just set myself up in a little studio area and I started streaming again and I had so many technical issues I had to stop and start and there was no point TO streaming (all it would do is make potential viewers never, ever come back), so I didn't stream and then the last two weeks things have FINALLY been going smoothly. 

The first week I streamed Space Engineers and art.  I do 3D modelling in Blender, so I did that (which didn't go amazingly well since it choked my CPU), but the most fun I had was with Space Engineers.

I got my first regulars from Blender and my second regulars from Space Engineers and a couple of them come in no matter what I'm playing (others come in specifically for Blender or Space Engineers). One of them always comes in even if it's just for a moment and that's lovely. 

Then last Wednesday night I had a really bad day, and when I woke up on Thursday my plan to do an art stream... well, I couldn't face it. 

So instead I got a new game - an indie game off Steam - and I streamed that.

Not only did I have NINE concurrent viewers, they were really active and talkative, keeping me company the whole time and laughing with me.

After the stream I tweeted out that I'd had a great time and that I really rated and recommended the game, using its hashtag.

...which was when the game's dev replied to me and said he'd wished he'd seen my stream.

That made me SO nervous, but I kept chill and I said it would've been great to have him there and that I love his game. He asked me to let him know when I streamed it next and since I was planning to stream it again the next day (I was addicted to it by this point!) I said I would.

So the next day I dropped him a mention.

AND HE CAME TO MY STREAM.

Not only did he spend about an hour and a half in my stream, talking about the game itself and commenting on my play (along with giving me tips about things I might have missed), but he talked about the root of some of the game's storylines (one was inspired off Mass Effect!), commented on how he'd noticed a bug he needed to change, and complimented the hell out of the fact I went back into a scary room to rescue one of my drones!

As someone who's hugely interested not only in game design itself but in how specific games come about, having the insight into how the developer thinks and what he's thinking as he watches someone stream his game was AMAZING.

He also chatted to the others in the stream - and there were at least five people talking the whole time, to me and to him - and when I jumped out of my skin and let out a scream he laughed that I'd made him and his wife scream! 

It was such an amazing experience and definitely my best stream yet - especially since I had eleven viewers at one point and a lot of them were chatting!

I just wanted to squeal about it :)

4jbzby,Don't let your passion become a burden - Take care of yourself.,"I need to address this 'cause I've seen way too many people work their arses off to a dark dark place. 

This is a message to you, streamer. I know you work hard because you care about your channel and your community. That's awesome! That's exciting! That's rewarding! But that's also stressful, pressurizing and demanding... especially once you get to a point where you get more and more ''successful'' (more and more people = more and more expectations, pressure etc).

Now, we all have to work hard to have our little tiny place within the wizarding world of Twitch, but is it worth neglecting our mental health? Of course not. I've seen casters that I dearly loved blow a fuse or simply break down on Twitter, Twitch or YouTube over their personal and/or professional issues because they have put their needs and personal life on the side to work on their channel. 

It's easy to turn a passion into a stressful and unpleasant experience in the long term. Sometimes, life hits you hard when you least expect it. Take care of yourself. Take time off if you need. You don't have to drain yourself because you feel like you OWE this to your viewers. They will understand... and if they don't, well, too bad for them.

Don't let your passion become a burden. We love you and we want you to be happy. And, a happy caster always delivers a better stream. Don't lose yourself over money or partnership. Love yourself, love your stream &amp; love your people. We take care of our body (brush teeth, do sports, go to the doctor when we're ill... etc.), but we don't usually think about caring about our mental health, and that's an issue :(

If you need to vent about anything (viewers, channel, video games, trolls, personal life vs streaming etc) you can do so here in the comments. You will see you're not alone. We all have our problems, but that doesn't mean we can't be a positive community.

4iuv9r,Success doesn't last forever. This is for the up and coming.,"So let me give you a brief description of myself.  My name is Nick AKA ""XpoZe"" and I originally started streaming in November of 2011 in Call of duty MW3.  I was competitive player and even placed Pro in two previous call of duty titles. Played this game for 10 years to this date but eventually got sick of it and we will get into that.


In 2011 I came across twitch, thought it looked awesome and instantly researched how to start streaming myself.  Instantly purchased a Black Magic Intensity Pro, downloaded X-Split (OBS wasn't out at the time) and started streaming.  I would work 8-9 hour days, come home and stream 9-10.  Id cut into my sleep to be able to stream. I didn't have much of a social life. Literally eat, work, stream, sleep repeat.  It was so fun to me


In 2011 there weren't a ton of streamers on twitch, let alone a ton in the call of duty section. Twitch wasn't near what it was today and there were probably a 1/2 or maybe even a 1/4 of the broadcasters on there.  Now because of my competitive play I had a small following in the scene, so when people were in the Call of duty section they recognized my name and stopped by. Throughout MW3 and into Black Ops I was averaging about 150-200 viewers and even peeking at anywhere from 500-700 viewers.  


I was on top the world. I loved streaming. At this point in twitch there was no twitch alerts, no donations, subscribing was a thing but I didn't even try for a partnership because I wanted to be consistent so that I had a better chance of getting approved. I streamed everyday for 8 hours minimum. (To get partnered you needed an average of 500 viewers but to get a subscriber button you need to average 1k-1.5k concurrent. Now if you get partnered you get a sub button)

Over time I could just tell I was not into Call of duty anymore. Not because I didn't like it but because I had the same routine day in day out.  It was the same repetitive thing everyday.  I was shocked anyone wanted to watch it. I wanted to spice it up and try something different to entertain the people watching and honestly to enjoy another game.  This is where I committed twitch suicide.  I went over to DayZ and instantly went from 150 viewers to 30.  I figured that would happen because the following I had was primarily call of duty.


I decided to ride it out and stay away from COD for a while but also letting the viewers know of my plans (also did youtube).  Over time that 30 turned to 28 to 25, to 20, to 12, to 6, to eventually just me. I found myself streaming everyday still and occasionally 3-6 of my originals popping in briefly to say whats up and then leave. I got to the point where I was SO excited when I saw someone chatting in my stream that I would do anything to engage in conversation with him/her.


I was so frustrated with the situation as a whole.  I went from on top of the world growing with COD but ended up getting sick of the game.  I switched to play a game I really enjoyed and here and there I would play other games that just came out or that I really enjoyed playing. I didn't wanna quit but I saw no progress. went from peaking at 500-700 viewers to virtually nothing so I took a break for a while. It took a toll on me personally so I had to take a couple months off to come back with a fresh mind.


Moral of this story is don't take the success you gain with streaming for granted.  One day you can have 700 viewers, interacting with everyone and everyone having a good time and the very next day you could be sitting in a stream talking to yourself. Make sure you have your priorities straight.  Do it because you enjoy it and know that you can make a living off it but play it safe.  If I were to quit my job at those 500-700 viewers I would have put myself in a very bad position because not even 4 months later I was frustrated with the game I was playing. Pick a game that you will always enjoy. 



I did all this without getting a SINGLE dime from Twitch or donations.  Ive been streaming for 5 years now and cherish every viewer i get.  I don't get many anymore but if I do im extremely happy. If i get a donation im jumping in joy.


Regarding the discussion of whether tip goals or any sort of donation should be allowed is really petty. If you put a goal up and don't reference it, that's one thing.  Go for it. People work hard for their money let them spend it how they want. (Now I am not saying streamers should ask the viewers to sub or donate every 10 mins or even at all but posting a tip goal is no different than having your donation link up there in the first place.) 


Everyone complains about advertising and selling out well guess what... TV does it, movies do it, sporting events do it, + more... Gaming and the streaming world is becoming big. Being a streamer for some people is very stressful... Not because they don't love what they do but because sometimes you put tons and tons of work in to see little reward.  This is coming from someone who has made a total of $100 over 5 years. Thats my 2 cents and my experiences.  Would love input.  Just trying to help. Thanks for reading this wall of text lol.


EDIT: My dream is to be able to make a living off of streaming.  Playing games and interacting with people who want to watch you play them?! It doesn't get much better than right? Unfortunately the sad reality is it isn't for everyone but more importantly unless you are someone like Lirik or Summit its not a fixed income that you can rely on.

4it6zc,Lirik's Tweets,"Before reading this, please go to Lirik's twitter and review what he said! This is just my opinion on his comments.

Lirik recently (half hour ago) went on a rant talking about those who had donation buttons and donation ""pages."" He discussed the idea of how it is wrong and should be treated like a hobby and for fun. I agree with him 100% it should be a hobby and should always be for the intentions of having fun!

This is where he is wrong though. He says ""you're doing it wrong"" for having these buttons and donation pages. He constantly says how he did it this way and he grew because of this and that. Just because you approach streaming differently than other major streamers' (like Lirik) doesn't make you a bad one just makes you different than them.

4igxhe,Best OBS Settings for Quality &amp; make your stream POP,"Hi Reddit, Psynaps here. I've been partnered for 2.5 years, I have configured and streamed esports tournaments for hundreds of thousands of viewers, and I currently have streaming servers setup all over north america. I am always looking for better settings to make my stream even higher quality than it already is. I have been helping people to YouTube and stream for 5+ years, and at last I am rolling out some guides (including a dual streaming guide coming soon). 

I have hesitated to do any guides on OBS because there ARE SO MANY already, but still I find missing and very inaccurate information. I also found that everyone is a self-proclaimed expert on settings ( :D ), and everyone has their own ""Best Settings for Twitch"". 

After all these years, now I am going to break down what the settings mean, and give you the knowledge to make your own ""Best Settings"". 

Let me know what your settings are in the comments (I will include those concerns and advise in the next videos). In the next video I will do OBS, then partnered vs. non-partnered settings, and finally dual-PC streaming and making your own streaming server (for mobile and private streams).

4i0sip,OBS Studio: How to stream music to Twitch but not to your local Youtube recording,"OBS Studio supports multiple audio tracks, and if you like to submit your recordings to Youtube, then here is a tutorial on how to make your local recording not include the music you played from your favorite music player.

Pre-requisites:

*OBS Studio and knowing how to do seperate local recording.
*Virtual audio cables [VAC] (Examples will use Voicemeeter)
*Basic knowledge of how VAC works


Your audio player of choice needs to be set to output audio directly to your speakers/headphones. For Foobar2000, it will look something like this: http://imgur.com/fv1SGyq

Windows needs to use your VAC as it's default output (checkmark): http://imgur.com/bcwwBHp

So, now that you are set up correctly, let's adjust OBS Studio to make use of this.

Step 1:

In File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Audio, put your speakers/headphones as ""Desktop Audio Device,"" and your VAC Input as ""Desktop Audio Device 2."": http://imgur.com/VRMs79W
You should now have two Desktop Audio meters in OBS (See picture for step 2.)

Step 2:

Click the gear icon next to Mixer: http://imgur.com/Zy8HZjy

In the ""Advanced Audio Properties"" dialog, you'll see all audio devices. If you have followed this tutorial so far, then ""Desktop Audio"" will be the music, and ""Desktop Audio 2"" will be anything else (game audio etc, from the VAC.) At the end of each line are for checkboxes: These represents which audio track each device will be sent to. 

Set ""Desktop Audio"" to track 1 only, ""Desktop Audio 2"" to track 1 and 2, and ""Mic/aux"" to all 4: http://imgur.com/RI8QLv3  [Edit 17/05/06: Image changed to reflect an earlier oversight]

Now your mic will be on all audiotracks, and game audio on track 1 and 2, music on track 1.

Step 3:

Now we'll set up the recording system. Go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Output. In ""output mode,"" select ""Advanced"" in the drop down menu.

In the first tab, ""Streaming,"" click in the first ""Audio Track 1"" box. (The rest of the settings are not covered in this tutorial, but mind that the bitrate might not be the same as you used when output mode was ""simple,"" so set it accordingly): http://imgur.com/pBrVLNI

In the second tab, ""Recording,"" select ""audio track"" 2, and make sure there is not a checkmark in track 1. This is done to make sure the local recording does not record your music. (Bonus tip: you can encode your local recording at a higher bitrate than your stream if you want a bit of better quality for Youtube. I do local recording at 2000kbps at 1920x1080, while my stream is encoded at 1500kbps 1280x720. Note: will impact computer perfomance!): http://imgur.com/VgHgcxM


And that's about it. Just remember to click both ""Start streaming"" and ""Start Recording"" when you go live.

EDIT: 05/05/16 at 21.10 gmt+1 it seems like the links to imgur is behaving strangly. It shows for some and not for others. In case you get an error, just refresh the error page (F5 in browser, some have more luck with shift+F5).

4i08tz,365 Days of Streaming Without Missing a Day,"Hi all,

So May 8th of 2015, we started to stream consecutively without any real goal in mind other than being consistent and maybe seeing how long we could go for. On Sunday, we're going to be hitting our one year anniversary. Now, we have had it a bit easier thanks to the fact the channel is 4 long-term real life friends, but it's also been challenging in that only one of us is dedicated full time to the channel (myself). So looking back, I just wanted to mention some advice and main things we've done/dealt with, and then open it up to an impromptu AMA that no one will give a shit about. This is most likely geared a bit more towards serious streamers as an FYI. LETS GOOOO!

*1. It's Hard as Balls*

Okay, so we have 4 people and you'd think that is going to make it easy. Yeah, so did I. But we're not a group like Streamer House who live together and stream 24 hours a day, as awesome as that sounds. 3 of us have jobs, and as such, things get busy and availability is tough. But moving on to things that are more directed at a single streamer, know you have to sacrifice a lot if you stream for any other reason than your own enjoyment or as a hobby. You have to sacrifice your time, your sleep, and also you social life outside of your hopefully awesome community. **Every day you're not streaming, every hour offline, is a loss of progress. Every day you take a break can set you back more than you realize, as keeping some viewers is about consistency and habit**. We're creatures of habit. Familiarity is comforting. So if you're not on at your regularly scheduled time, and schedule is fucking preemo important, they may find someone else to watch. And keeping viewers is a battle unless they have a loyalty to you, care about you, feel invested in the stream. The true fan theory if you will.  
  
One thing to note is **I have seen a few streams that have had good progress and growth die because they realized they wanted to have more of a social life, or have burnt out**. It's something that I don't think people realize, so keep it in mind.  
  
*2. Game Choice*  
  
One day on the Discord server for this subreddit, SHAMELESS PLUG, a gentleman came in and basically was asking for advice on why he hasn't grown. He had 150 new followers in the span of a year and a half. Which to me is pretty abysmal growth. So, I decided to check out his stream a bit to give him some help. His last games he streamed was League of Legends, CS:Go, and Starcraft 2. Two of those games are almost always in the top 5 streamed games. If you have lets say 5 viewers, you're 200 streams down. That's how far someone has to scroll down to find you. OF COURSE YOU AREN'T GROWING. You can't play games that everyone else is unless you draw viewers from outside of Twitch with content somewhere else. No one is gonna find you! Now, there are many other factors it could be. Maybe a random schedule. Maybe he's just an awful streamer (I'm sorry, but not everyone is cut out to be a successful streamer or astronaut). There are so many reasons, but I'm pretty confident that is the big one he had.  
  
Guys. Guys, guys, guys. And girls. Though I use guys for girls. So, guys. **Don't stream hugely popular games unless you have a strategy to bring people to watch from outside Twitch and expect growth**. Don't go stream Dark Souls 3 day one unless it's for your regulars or yourself. Don't stream Overwatch right now unless you are good with no growth that day. Stream games with 500-2000 viewers. Make your stream title descriptive to what you're doing. The big boys can write ""mistakes"" as a headline and get away with it. We cannot. Wanna play a big game? Wait a week to a month so that it calms down enough that you can be noticed.  
  
*3. Advertising and Social Media*  
  
It's a large sea out there, with a lot of fish. Getting noticed is all about consistency and attrition. Be active on Twitter and Facebook. Chime into twitter conversations with things that contribute, as you never know who will like what you said and check your feed history. Also, big streamers may subconsciously remember you and follow you or check out your content. **Don't just spam your live links and call it a day, as no one is going to give a shit about your Twitter**. Have personality in there. Meme it up. Make it you.  
  
Network with your fellow streamers via Discord or their chats (Don't pimp your shit, just be friendly. It'll get talked about organically). Realize you're in it for the long haul and it's going to be clawing up a mountain for a long time.  
  
*4. GameWisp or Patreon*  
  
I think these are great resources because you will find people who truly love what you do and want to support you monthly. There are a lot of people who grew up gaming and now have extra income and can be generous. Whether they want to support you, reward you, troll you a bit (least in donations). You're an internet panhandler (thanks, Ducksauce, for that term I stole!). **And there is nothing wrong with being compensated for your time**. We all love to stream, that's the first priority. But we also love to eat and live a good quality of life, and streams need support to get new games and equipment (if you're lucky). It's never required, but the option should be there. Also, don't feel bad promoting your social media links and Gamewisp *tastefully*. Metrics are important for when you want to get your foot in the door with organizations, sponsors, etc.  
  
I've already gone pretty long, so feel free to consider this an AMA. I will say we are NOT a huge stream, and my opinions are exactly that, so don't take it as gospel. Hope you all have fun, and stay safe.  
  
**Edit:** One quick thing I'd like to add that ties into the first point. **Streamer Depression is very real**. No one ever talks about streamer depression, but it's so very real. Watching numbers go up and down, not making headway, or having a good day and then having it go back to bad days. It's very, very real. And it's tough. Just try to keep your head up and stay positive when it hits. It's like anything in that it will get better.

Your platform is being abused by a certain streamer, they're using depression and anxiety as a tool to get money for their ""healing journey"". You don't need me to tell you how offensive this is towards people who are actually struggling with mental health, right?

4girq6,Streamer Manipulating/Scamming for Donations Right Now,"I just noticed that this streamer JennyTheSquirrel / Jenny Seol / KpopBabyJenny is literally asking people to donate money to her to 'cure' her depression. She has been flooding her stream with nonstop crocodile tears, all the while she has a donation tracker on her stream that basically tells viewers that they will 'help her overcome PTSD' by donating cash. Her bot tells her to 'help Jenny's healing journey' by buying games using her G2A code. It really says that, it's like she's not even trying to hide her intent. [***I've appropriately reported her for scamming.***](http://i.imgur.com/PBuTpBg.jpg)

This isn't a charity stream, it's someone ***plainly and clearly monetizing the topic of depression for personal profit***. It's hideous and offensive to anyone who has ever suffered depression or known someone who has taken their life. Is Twitch really allowing this? Is this fair game now? This is no different than all of those troll streamers who threw pretend fits for hours, knowing it would bring attention and money. Most of them were rightly banned. Will Twitch do the right thing now, or should the message go out that troll streamers fake crying for money are welcome back? If so, let's message all the ones who were banned and get them to return, since those rules aren't being enforced anymore.

If, however, anything she is doing is honest and legitimate, then I wholeheartedly apologize, Jenny Seol. I wish I'd known that cold hard cash cures depression back when I was in the worst parts of it, maybe I'd have robbed a few liquor stores instead of cutting myself and wanting to die. You're a real inspiration.

Just as I was writing this, someone donated to get her up to $1000. You're a real hero, Jenny. No doubt that person saved a life. No doubt.

I hope she submits her donation trackers to research psychologists, it would be very useful to know exactly how much money can instantly cure depression and PTSD. From that point on, human suffering can be fought with direct fundraising!

That is a link to directly email Twitch. As we all know, they don't really care that much when you report for ""non-gaming content"", so shove that meme out a window and do something meaningful. Report her for SCAMMING. Take one minute and send them an email using that form, showing them that you're serious about wanting to rid Twitch of such manipulative and harmful behaviors. **Letting them know that you're willing to contact their advertisers wouldn't hurt either.** I doubt their advertisers want to be associated with people faking depression for pure profit.

Some people have already taken to Twitter, to ensure that this kind of corrupt and unethical behavior is stopped.

I went to the twitch booth, found Summit1G, and told him my friends story, how he really wanted to meet him but couldn't.

Without hesitation, Summit1G reached into his bag, and pulled out his one-of-a-kind twitch partnership T-shirt, and signed it with a personal message to Dylan! I immediately called Dylan and Summit1g picked up the phone and even talked to him!

I just want to say thanks to Summit1G for doing what he did. I know this means a lot to Dylan and I can't wait to hear his response when I mail it to him! I really wanted to put this out there to thank him and show everyone how much of a stand up guy Summit1G is.

##Equipment and Software##
This section is meant to provide some general advice and guidelines. If you want to learn more about equipment, my strong recommendation is to check out the [Twitch subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch). There are some incredibly knowledgeable people there who have posted guides and answered so many questions on improving your broadcasting setup.  One caveat: please use the search function.  Many common questions have already been answered, and if you do some research, you’ll get more value out of the questions you do ask!

&amp;nbsp;

###Equipment###

* #####Microphone#####
    While it’s technically possible, I don’t know of any high quality broadcasts on Twitch that don’t use a microphone. Verbal communication is one of your best means of interacting with your audience and adding value to your stream. As a result, I would recommend spending at least a bit of money to get a mid-range USB microphone. A high-end audio setup would be ideal, but for a beginning broadcaster, there are several great options well under $150. Commonly recommended microphones include the CAD-u37, Blue Snowball, Blue Yeti, and the Audio-Technica AT2020. Setting up these microphones correctly is also important.  This involves positioning the microphone close enough to your mouth, reducing background noise, and a lot of experimentation with settings. 

    Because audio can be such a detailed and difficult topic to broach, here are two incredibly useful guides:

    [*Basic Audio Guide*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2o6qhv/beginners_guide_to_audio_part_1_microphones/)
    
    [*Advanced Audio Guide*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3xrtpc/proaudio_guide_part_1_gear_philosophy_choosing/) 

* #####Camera#####
    A camera isn’t a required piece of casting equipment, but remains a reasonable choice for many streamers. That visual element adds another way for you to reach your audience, and some people will only watch streams where they can see the broadcaster.  However, using a camera also requires you to be cognizant of your physical appearance, mannerisms, and posture. If you look slovenly or disinterested, your camera is probably hurting you more than helping.

    Starting out, any 1080p or 720p webcam is more than sufficient. Eventually, you might consider using an HD camcorder with a capture card, but that is probably overkill initially. The Logitech C920 line is probably the most often recommended option. I’ve also had personal success with the Microsoft Lifecam. Either way, find a way to position your camera well.  Use a tripod, mounting bracket or just a lot of duct tape. Also remember to select the correct camera resolution in whatever capture program you use, and make sure that with each game you play, the camera is positioned over a relatively unimportant part of the screen.

* #####Streaming Computer#####
    Remember that your computer will be both running a game and encoding your stream. Encoding is a CPU-intensive operation and you can easily have issues as a result.  A mid-range i5 (or equivalent) processor or is the absolute low end of what you want for broadcasting. An i7 is ideal, as your CPU will be supporting both your broadcasting software and the game you’re playing.  Obviously, your computer should be powerful enough to run whatever games you wish to play beyond that.  That usually entails  having at least 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a video card that is at least as powerful as a GTX 650 series.  While your streaming software won’t have a huge impact on RAM usage, it will put at least a bit of strain on your video card, so be aware of this.

    A two-computer setup bypasses many of these issues, but is probably beyond most beginning broadcasters. For an introductory look on the topic:

    [*Two PC Broadcasting Guide*](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1988680-broadcasting-with-two-computers)

* #####Screen Space#####
    You need to be able to play your game, adjust capture settings, and read chat while you’re streaming. Doing all that from a single monitor is a challenge. Ideally, you want at least two monitors when you broadcast (or if you have a laptop available, consider using that to view chat). 

* #####Lighting and Green Screen#####
    A starting broadcaster likely don’t require heavy lighting or a green screen. I recommend setting up a pair of desk lamps with white-light bulbs, one on each side of your camera, facing you. Buy compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL) in the 3500K+ temperature range from your local hardware or big-box store. Mess around with positioning to ensure the highest quality.

    If you want to set up a green screen, you can do so inexpensively.  Fabric from a local craft store can easily be hung from hooks in your ceiling, strung up on some clips or a retractable clothesline, or stretched over a PVC pipe frame.  This will look good in almost every case, and should cost $30 or less.  Play around with the lighting you have before committing to a large lighting purchase, but a green screen will benefit from at least two directed light sources.  Also note, distance is your friend - increasing the space between your body and a green screen reduces shadows and improves chroma keying.

* #####Other#####
    Use headphones or a good headset to listen to game audio. Speakers will be picked up by your microphone and the resulting echo is thoroughly unpleasant for your viewers.

    If you plan on playing console games, remember that Twitch does have a streaming app on both Xbox One and PS4. This limits many of your customization options, but can be a reasonable option for many people.  If you want to stream on other systems, you’ll need to buy a capture card to manage this. This is something that you’ll want to research and understand before committing to. Check these links for more information.

    [*Information on my Favorite Capture Card*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/43vlyz/micomsoft_sc512n1ldvi_help/) 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
 
###Software and Stream Setup###

* #####Broadcasting Software#####
    Today you have several options for broadcasting. You can simply use the built-in software on the current generation of consoles, but this severely limits your streaming options.  Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) and XSplit are the dominant choices out there, though a few others do exist. OBS is free and has vastly improved since its early days. XSplit is subscription-based, but has options and settings that many people prefer. Use what you want and note that ultimately, you’ll have most of the same basic options on all of those pieces of software. 

    [*XSplit Home Page*](https://www.xsplit.com/) 

    [*OBS Home Page*](https://obsproject.com/) 

* #####Initial Setup of Software#####
    Use a guide. There are many of them out there for every piece of broadcasting software and they will help.  For easy access, I am linking the standard Twitch OBS and XSplit broadcasting guides below. Use the Twitch subreddit to find more in-depth information!

    [*OBS Setup Guide*](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1262922-open-broadcaster-software)

    [*XSplit Setup Guide*](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/733542-xsplit)  

* #####Understand Upload Rate, Resolution, Framerate, and Presets#####
    Your upload rate determines how much data your stream can use.  Chances are, the amount of upload you can reliably use is slightly less than what your ISP states you have.  With a 5Mbps upload speed, you might get 3.5-4.5 Mbps that you can use without issues.  This upload rate corresponds to the bitrate that you set in your capture software (1000 bitrate is using about 1Mbps).  Higher upload rates mean more data can be used and will generally give you better quality. 

    Regardless of the amount of data you use, you can set the resolution your viewers see and the number of frames they receive each second (framerate).  Playing a game in a higher resolution or framerate than you are streaming impacts computer performance without improving what your viewers see.  Playing at lower resolutions hurts your quality.
Your encoding preset impacts how much effort your CPU devotes to encoding.  Slower presets yield better quality, at the cost of intense CPU usage.  Veryfast is a generally solid setting, but trying to push out better quality video with low bandwidth may require a lower preset.

    When you stream with a lower resolution and fewer frames, it takes less data to look good.  Less on-screen action also takes less data to look good. And thus, you have a balancing game between your stable bitrate and stream quality. 

    [*Approximating Settings*](http://streamcalc.net/) 

* #####Don’t Overdo your Bitrate#####
    Viewers with slower internet will find it impossible to view streams that broadcast too much data.  Raising your bitrate too high will essentially remove a large portion of your potential audience from the start. 2000-2500 is a bitrate that will allow you to have a high quality 540p 30fps stream or acceptable 720p 30fps stream for many games without isolating too many viewers.

* #####Provide Some Basic Information Below Your Channel#####
    Use the Edit Panels option below your stream and create panels, one for each topic, below your broadcast. If nothing else, include concise information about who you are, the rules of your channel, and the times you plan on streaming.  You can also make specific images and upload them for each panel.  Check later in this section for a few (free) sources of panel images.

* #####Update your Profile and Basic Channel Images#####
    Take a moment to navigate to www.twitch.tv/mychannelname/profile while you’re logged into your account.  There, you should be able to update your profile information and banner image. Likewise, navigate to [https://secure.twitch.tv/](https://secure.twitch.tv/)settings to change your profile icon, and go to [https://secure.twitch.tv/settings/channel](https://secure.twitch.tv/settings/channel) to change your offline image for your stream.  These don’t need to be anything fancy, and you’ll likely end up changing them, but they add a personal touch to your channel.

* #####You Don’t Need Overlays and Buttons, But They’re Easy to Make or Get#####
    When you begin broadcasting, you can do fine without any stream images or overlays.  Displaying the game itself and a message for when you take breaks should be enough.  The only times I would really recommend using an overlay early on is when you are playing a game with an odd aspect ratio, or if you really want to include chat in your broadcast (however, with the formal introduction of the Chat Replay option on Twitch, on-stream chat is even less important).

    However, it doesn’t take much to learn the basic Paint or Photoshop skills to make simple buttons or stream images. Type “Twitch Overlay” into YouTube and the first few results will be a collection of 10-20 minute tutorials working you through the basic process. You can make serviceable stream assets with a few hours of work at most.  Or, you can find a few free ones to use online instead.

    [*Free Twitch Panels/Buttons 2*](http://thingsforstreams.com/) 

    [*Free Twitch Panels/Buttons 3*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/24lq8j/for_you_new_streamers_out_there_ive_made_a/) 

    [*Free Twitch Panels/Buttons 4*](http://styles.artsonist.co/tagged/Tech) 

* #####Alerts and Bots Are Mostly Just Distractions, Starting Out#####
    Starting out your broadcast, alerts are something you probably don’t need. Donations and subscriptions aren’t really a concern for you, and follower alerts probably won’t do much to build your channel.  These things may have more value later, but for now, they take your focus from more important things.

    Likewise, a chatbot is an excellent tool for many streams. You can work in moderation tools, automated reminders and information spam, channel currency, viewer rewards, and lots of other functionality into your chat with a well designed bot.  But starting out, you really will need none of that. Without a regular audience, you should focus on content rather than fluff.

    &amp;nbsp;

    If you absolutely insist on using alerts initially, I can recommend: 

    [*StreamPro*](https://streampro.io)

    [*TwitchAlerts*](https://www.twitchalerts.com/)

    Using these with OBS requires you to install CLR browser on OBS.

    [*Installing CLR Browser*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2i7o7y/guide_setting_up_clr_browser_for_obs_chat_and/) 

    &amp;nbsp;

    As for publically-available chat bots, the following are generally useful, with some simple setup involved: 

    [*Xanbot*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2dkro7/a_detailed_guide_on_howto_configure_and_operate/)

    [*Moobot*](http://twitch.moobot.tv/)

    [*Nightbot*](https://beta.nightbot.tv/)

    [*Anhkbot*](http://marcinswierzowski.com/Code/AnkhBotR2/)

    Moobot and Nightbot have a relatively simple-to-use online interface. Anhkbot is a bit more involved, but is very well-received in general.

4fn6h8,Don't let anyone tell you it's impossible to get noticed on Twitch these days,"I'm not one of those whackos who believe every word of ""The Secret"", but from life experience, success and attitude go hand and hand. Simply having a great attitude and maintaining it can do wonders for your Twitch. 

I've been streaming for 5 weeks.  I'm currently at 312 followers, with 15 to 20 steady viewers every stream. I got no facecam, I'm streaming from a PS4, I'm not on Twitter or Youtube and barely get on Facebook. I've only been hosted one time and by another small streamer.  My attitude is literally the only thing carrying my channel, and it's working. 

 I don't pay attention to the viewer count, I don't remind people constantly to follow,  or let anything stress me. I just make jokes, treat everyone in chat like an old friend, and simply have fun with it. (although game choice is slightly important. I stream mostly MKX and Bloodborne which aren't saturated and have a loyal following.)

If you have the attitude that you'll never make it on Twitch than you probably won't. Don't let others discourage you with statistics of how hard it is to get noticed these days, or let a slow day or two discourage you. Just have fun with your stream and keep an amazing attitude.

Twitch is like anything in life,  you're going to face obstacles and negatives, sometimes extreme ones.  In everything you do in life there's always that giant negative monster coming after you. When he does, and you look in your armory,  you've got one sword.  Your attitude.  You can stay positive and slay the beast, or run away and complain to Reddit about how Twitch is ""dead"" and there are too many ""cleavage streams"" to compete with and other bitter things. 

The choice is yours.

4fbvjj,CS:GO Skin Gambling as it's own category???,"It's really annoying digging through Global Offensive streams and having to sort out all the skin gamblers, that's not CS:GO that's betting skins. I really would like to see it made into it's own category so that if I am looking for game play I can just find game play. 

EDIT: Let's keep in mind it's not the people streaming the gambling that's the problem, it's the fact that Twitch doesn't have a category for them. They're gambling CS:GO skins so obviously Global Offensive is the most accurate title they can use at the moment. 

It's in Twitch's hands to add the section for betting CS:GO skins (or gambling in general) that way the people who aren't playing the game have a more accurate category to stream under.

4eyva6,A Guide to Streaming and Finding Success on Twitch,"Hey everyone! I've put together a fairly sizable guide for new and growing broadcasters on Twitch and I was hoping to share it with all of you. [You can download a PDF of the full guide here!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4xbpa5v8zp88lfc/Streaming%20and%20Finding%20Success%20on%20Twitch.pdf?dl=0)

Be warned, the guide is lengthy, and definitely not meant to be read straight through from beginning to end. There's a lot of covered topics and they're intended to be tackled as you need them. Also, many of them are geared towards broadcasters first starting out with Twitch. I'm hoping to post the entire thing here on the subreddit, in manageable pieces, over the next few weeks. Feel free to share the guide in its complete form and I would appreciate any suggestions you might offer in the comments for revisions in an updated release. The first few sections follow below.

&amp;nbsp;
*****
&amp;nbsp;

#Part I: The Basics of Streaming#

###Starting Out###
New broadcasters have a challenging time ahead of them on Twitch.  There’s so much to do, nearly endless things to learn, and nobody really knows you exist. Even if you’re willing to work hard, knowing how to get started is a challenge in itself.  What follows is a fairly comprehensive list of things you probably want to work on as you first start broadcasting.

Initially, you’ll benefit from doing a lot of learning and practicing. Unless you have experience entertaining, public speaking, and working with the relevant equipment and software, there is a lot to pick up before you can expect your content to be good.  **Successful streamers make something worth watching**. After all, if your stream isn’t entertaining, why should anyone want to see it?

To start off, I’ve broken this section down into five main topics:

* What Are Your Goals?
* Planning and Mental Preparation
* Equipment and Software 
* Tips for Early Growth
* Positive Streaming Behaviors

I recommend reading through these sections, and putting some thought and work into planning your broadcast.  Make a basic plan for your channel and then just start streaming - experiment and find out if you even like it.  Read the list of positive streaming behaviors and incorporate them into your cast.  Finally, as you find the need for more specific information, approach individual sections in Part II of this guide for additional advice.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
 
###What Are Your Goals?###
If you’re even thinking about broadcasting on Twitch, stop and answer that question. Twitch is an amazing environment with room for broadcasters of every size with every imaginable way of using their service.  What do you want your place to be?  Knowing your goals impacts how you should be reading this guide.

* **How large do you want your broadcast to be?** You may be streaming for personal friends, a small audience, or tens of thousands of viewers. Smaller audiences will be easier to reach. Larger audiences will take effort and compromises to attain.

* **What is your gaming niche?** Maybe you love speedrunning.  You might play an MMORPG or a MOBA. You might be into indie games, console games, classic games, fighting games, a single game, or every new release.  Or you might be a variety caster, playing any game at any time.

* **What will the attitude of my cast be?** You could be serious, angry, or lighthearted. Do you want people laughing with you, at you, or because of you? Will you cultivate an air of maturity surrounding your stream or is anything permitted?

* **What can you do that makes you special?** At the end of 2015, Twitch had over 2.1 million unique broadcasters and 13k partnered channels. Obviously, not everyone is going to be unique in a group that size, but what can you do to make yourself stand out in people’s minds?

You don’t need all the answers when you’re just starting out, but the more you know, the better off you’ll be. If you want to have at least a small regular audience, streaming on Twitch is at least an involved hobby.  Reaching even more people makes it more like managing a small business. Answering the above questions is like the first step of putting together a business plan.  Once you know what you’re trying to accomplish, you can start building a plan for your cast to reach those goals.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
 
###Planning and Mental Preparation###
Let me begin with a reminder: know your goals for streaming. When you think about the next few steps, realize that different goals require different things. A strict streaming schedule, for example, may leave someone testing the waters with broadcasting burnt out, but is necessary for someone trying hard to maximize their stream growth. With that in mind, here are some preliminaries you should think about and work on as you start toying with broadcasting.

* #####Remember to Enjoy Yourself#####
    If you don’t enjoy creating content, people likely won’t enjoy the content you create. Personality and energy are important for drawing people to your stream. Once you start losing those because you aren’t enjoying yourself, something needs to change. Before you even start broadcasting, you don’t know if you’ll enjoy it.  Keep fun in mind as you think about these suggestions, and never forget it as your channel grows.

* #####Figure Out What Makes You Interesting#####
    Take a long few minutes to figure out what are the best aspects about you. You don’t need something crazy, different, or unique here. Are you an exceptionally skilled gamer? Do you think you’re funny? Can you instruct others well? Make people feel good about themselves? If you can’t think of anything, you aren’t trying hard enough. 

    At this point, trying to fully brand your channel may be difficult and you may not have the casting experience to make it work for you. But you can still be interesting and play to your strengths. Figuring out what they are is a good start.

* #####Name Your Channel Carefully#####
    Your Twitch handle will stick with you the entire time you broadcast. Name changes are next to impossible to get, and you probably don’t want to rebuild everything on a new channel just because you want a different name. Ideally, your name should be unique and interesting. Symbols, underscores and random letters/numbers are probably unnecessary. When in doubt, simple is probably best.

    Once you create [your Twitch name](https://passport.twitch.tv/users/new), take thirty minutes out of your day. [Create an e-mail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) tied to that name. Use it to register accounts with your Twitch handle on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/signup), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/?ref_type=registration_form), [Youtube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/161805?hl=en), [Discord](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/join/), and any other forms of social media or services you may ever think about using. It costs nothing, and you’ll reserve those spaces for whenever they’re relevant to you.

* #####Think About Your Schedule#####
    When you stream is important, especially to you. Committing to more than you can enjoyably do is a disaster waiting to happen. However, streaming more hours is generally better for growing a broadcast, and keeping those hours relatively consistent from week to week benefits both you and your viewers. Finding a happy medium between randomly casting and a strict schedule is fairly important.

    Some things to keep in mind:
    * Short streams make it hard to reach new viewers and hold interest. Broadcasting at minimum 2-4 hours at a time usually works well.
    * Many “professional” broadcasters stream 4-8 hours at a time, 5-7 days a week. You don’t need to do this. However, if your schedule allows it and you enjoy streaming, it is probably good for growth.
    * Twitch is worldwide and covers many time zones. If your stream times shift wildly from day to day, you’ll be reaching viewers in many different time zones, making it harder to get regular viewers. 
    * Start small, and leave room to grow. Find a few regular times to broadcast throughout the week where you could have extra time to stream if you feel like it. Try to commit to some relatively short broadcasts, and keep going if you enjoy it.
    * Remember that changing your broadcast times without warning will make it more difficult for viewers to catch your stream again.

* #####Practice Talking to Yourself, About Everything You Do#####
    Streaming, especially without a large audience, benefits from constant commentary.  You need to be engaging and interesting to other people who may not even be there.  Learn to narrate your life. Explain everything you’re doing, remembering that it may not always be clear to other people. Commentate your thought process - make your internal monologue external (with some filtering of course). Learning how to do that before you start broadcasting is a great place to start.

* #####Watch Other Streams Critically#####
    You probably already watch at least a few very decent streamers on Twitch for personal enjoyment. There should be some things that they do wonderfully on stream and at least a few things that could stand some improvement. Watch their streams and figure out what those things are. Emulate good qualities, and try to avoid the bad. Do this with as many different broadcasters as you can. Take notes. And when you eventually start broadcasting, watch your past streams and do the same.

* #####Don’t Commit To Being Yourself#####
    Who you are and how you feel in your everyday life doesn’t have to determine how you act on stream. You can be yourself, or an even better you.  After all, you probably don’t naturally talk to yourself as you play video games.  So why draw the line there?  Be open to experimentation, especially before you have a solid audience.  Try being silly, excited, bouncy, crazy, anything.  Exaggerate your best qualities.  Minimize your worst.  Focus on how you say words and improve the way you speak. Be willing to be more outgoing and interesting.

    There are no personality police.  Nobody will say “you can’t act that way because you weren’t that way before.”  Think of this like The New Guy - Twitch is a place where you are free to redefine yourself.

* #####Consider the niche you want to occupy#####
    There’s no need to decide what your place will be on Twitch too early on, but realize that the types of games you play and when you switch them will impact your viewing audience.  Know that the way you behave and how you interact with your audience shapes the way your stream will grow and how your chat will develop.  Start determining these things as you experiment with broadcasting, and learn more about them as you begin attracting regular viewers.

4ep73f,Ever want to capture your Discord voice channels to your stream? I made a utility to capture the game overlay.,"Hi all. Any console streamers that use Discord wish you could capture the Discord voice channel activity to your stream while still being able to use the desktop application for text/chat? I wrote a small utility application to capture the Discord game overlay for my stream, and thought others might have a use for it too.

&amp;nbsp;

**Discord Overlay Host**

I created the Discord Overlay Host application so that I could capture my voice chat to OBS while I stream to Twitch, and still be able to use the desktop application for responding to text chat.

&amp;nbsp;

This application allows you to create an OpenGL or DirectX ""game"" window and then add it to Discord to put their overlay on it. You can then use OBS game capture to display the portions you want on stream.

&amp;nbsp;

I made a short (7:23) video to show how to use it [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxlvWcBRwA)

[Here is a screenshot of the utility](http://i.imgur.com/DkzKNOd.png)

&amp;nbsp;

[OBS Project resource page.](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/discord-overlay-host.371)

&amp;nbsp;

I have the source code available on [GitHub.](https://github.com/AsterDW/DiscordOverlayHost)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the direct link for the [releases page.](https://github.com/AsterDW/DiscordOverlayHost/releases)

&amp;nbsp;

From the releases page click on the DiscordOverlayHost.zip file link. It contains the executable files inside a folder you can run from wherever you prefer to extract it.

&amp;nbsp;

It is written in C# and requires the .Net Framework 4.5.2 to run.

Supported Operating Systems |
------------------------------------|
Windows 7 |
Windows 8 and 8.1 |
Windows 10|

&amp;nbsp;

Specific notes related to OBS Classic and OBS Studio.

&amp;nbsp;

**OBS Classic**

The game capture feature of the classic OBS does not work on the host windows and the window capture does not work for the OpenGL window. Instead use the DirectX host and use Window Capture to add the host window to your scene.

&amp;nbsp;

**OBS Studio**

Game Capture with the option to Capture third-party overlays enabled is the preferred method of capturing either host window. The DirectX host window can also be captured using window capture though.

&amp;nbsp;

I would really appreciate it if someone who uses other streaming software, such as XSplit, could try it out on those platforms and let me know if it works.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope you find it useful for your streams.

4eghmh,[BETA] Automatically Alert Your Steam Group When You Go Live!,"*This post has now been approved by /r/twitch moderators, thanks guys!*


**What is this and how does this work?**


This is a Steambot known as ""Nanobot"" which automatically detects when your Twitch goes live and will post an announcement or event (your preference) to your steam group.



*Please note that this is in early beta and issues will occur once and a while, if they do occur, contact me directly or use the !reportbug command.*


*Due to Twitch's API, it can take up to 1 minute to detect that you're live, and up to 3 minutes that you're offline. So don't expect group alerts to be instant!*



---



**That's neato, how do I set this up?**


Easy. You can link multiple twitch accounts to multiple steam groups and vice versa. Also, in order for this to work, you must be an officer of the group you're trying to link your twitch to. Here's how to set it up:


* Send a friend request to [Nanobot](http://steamcommunity.com/id/inanobot)

* Open a chat window with Nanobot

* Type in the command !linktwitch [Twitch Name] [Steam Group Name] [0=announcement/1=event/2=both] [Custom Title or ""streamtitle"" which fetches the stream's title from twitch] [Body of announcement/event]

* Go to your steam group and add Nanobot to Officer so that it is able to create announcements/events when you go live.

* Done!



If Nanobot didn't join your group, please type in the command !joingroup [Group Name] to retry it. If the issue still occurs, contact me or post on this discussion!


---



**The !linktwitch command is confusing, help me!**


Use quotes for any argument that has spaces in it!
I'll break it down per argument in order (1 is the first argument, 2 is the second argument, etc):


* 1) This is the name of your twitch channel found in the URL after ""twitch.tv/"". For example, my channel is http://twitch.tv/xnanochip so I would put ""xnanochip"" for this argument.


* 2) This is the name of your steam group found in the URL after ""http://steamcommunity.com/groups/"". For example, if your group was the TwitchTV steam group, the URL is https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TwitchTV, you'd put ""TwitchTV"" as this argument.


* 3) This argument is the alert type you want, which must be a number ranging from 0 to 2. 0 for announcement alert, 1 for event alert, or 2 for both announcement and event alerts.


* 4) This is what the title of each alert will be. Note that you must put quotes around this argument if it contains any spaces. You can also just put ""streamtitle"" as this argument and it'll use whatever your stream's title is on twitch.


* 5) This is the body of the announcement. note that you must put quotes around this argument if it contains any spaces. A great example would be ""LIVE @ http://twitch.tv/xnanochip""


Example command: !linktwitch xnanochip TwitchTV 2 streamtitle ""LIVE @ http://twitch.tv/xnanochip""


Tada! That wasn't so bad was it?

4e12i4,"[Suggestion] Add a ""Charity"" button to Twitch. Put an end to charity fraud.","Good morning. I wanted to post this to twitch.uservoice.com, but I do not use Facebook or Google for personal reasons. I've seen a few Suggestion threads on this sub, so I'm hoping this might get some support.

A couple days ago a controversial feminist charity held a fundraiser for themselves on Twitch. The charity in question provided no information on their Twitch profile or Subscription pages about the nature of their organization or fundraiser. Viewers were encouraged to support this fundraiser when the only visible way to do so was with a channel Subscription, which would not meet documentation requirements for charitable donations. The Subscription page for the channel made no promises about whether the money would go directly to the fundraising effort, or even to the charitable organization itself. There is no VOD of this fundraiser or transcript of the claims made during it, but I've gone into more detail about what I feel this charity/fundraiser did wrong [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4ds8l3/so_how_does_people_feel_about_twitch_putting_this/d1v97zv).

This is the most high-profile instance that I am aware of involving a charity fundraiser on Twitch where the raising/collection of funds was done improperly and quite possibly, illegally. Although the situation was unusual in that it involved an actual charity (which should know better about documentation requirements), its methods of collection were unfortunately par the course for Twitch. There are numerous examples in this community of popular, partnered Broadcasters relying on the ""Subscription"" button as a charity drive tool. Some of these fundraising efforts are organized by well-intentioned streamers who have no idea they are acting with reckless disregard for charitable solicitation laws. Others knowingly wade into this shadow of controversy because Subscriptions are the most convenient tool at their disposal for tracking the monetary contributions of viewers. Oftentimes however, Broadcasters who engage in this practice are clouded with accusations of potential fraud in an environment absent of any accountability and auditing.

TLDR: Charity streams and fundraisers in which viewers are induced to Subscribe to a channel, or send a lump-sum payment directly to a Broadcaster's PayPal, unnecessarily expose streamers to liability and viewers to fraud. This practice is for the most part largely unregulated on Twitch to my knowledge. If Twitch is not going to moderate this practice, then I implore them to create alternative, legitimate tools for Broadcasters who wish to raise money for charity.

My suggestion is to introduce a ""Charity"" button similar to the ""Subscribe"" button, with all money going directly to a designated registered charity. This could be a page hosted on Twitch similar to the Subscription page, or a direct link to an official DonorDrive page for the registered charity. Ideally, it would be possible for this process to hook into the Twitch API in some way, so that streaming tools could be written that track viewer contributions in the same way that they already do for Subscriptions.

There are many reasons why such a tool would be of benefit to Twitch, its community and charities. I feel that it would also quash potential fraud and further legitimize Twitch as a platform for charitable causes in gaming. Thoughts?

4db2ie,Twitch Leecher - New VOD Downloader,"Version 1.4.1 is out!

Download here:

https://github.com/Franiac/TwitchLeecher/releases

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

I know there are many people out there who want to download their past broadcasts and highlights from Twitch.tv. I tried to use many different VOD downloaders. But (without offending anybody) most of those tools are programmed horribly.
Since I had problems with recording my stream locally while streaming, I decided to write my own VOD downloader (I am a Software Developer). But now the guys from OBS have fixed all issues in 13.2 and I don't need the software anymore which is a little unfortunate :P

So i decided to make my new tool free, open source and available to everybody. It is the very first release, so there might be bugs in it that I don't know of... just in case.

Download / Screenshot / Information:

https://github.com/Franiac/TwitchLeecher

Main Features:

- Very easy to use, no manual needed
- Intuitive and stylish GUI
- Up to 20 times faster download speed compared to direct download with FFMPEG
- Browse your past broadcasts and highlights within the application
- Search channels, VOD urls and VOD IDs
- Subscriber-Only VOD download support
- Time Selection for VOD downloads
- Queue multiple downloads
- Specify default search parameters
- Specify default download folders
- Specify a filename template with wildcards for your downloads
- Developed by an experienced Software Engineer
- Free and Open Source

I hope it is useful for some of you :)

4ckg8y,"When You Think About Streaming, Consider This","Streaming is *simple* but it is not easy. 

It is *rewarding* but it is not instant 

I work a full time job, 45 hours a week not including travel time. I get home at 12:30 AM. I try to eat and then start streaming at 1 AM. My stream is supposed to last from 1 AM to 7 AM according to the schedule that I made for myself. My free time is non existent. I literally sleep, work and stream. 

The games I used to be able to play for hours on hours on end are not the same games as when I started. My endurance for playing them is not the same. When I grow bored and want to switch I need to think twice, because the choice is really more of do I want to grow my stream as fast as I can or do I want to cripple that growth by swapping games. 

I'm not a big streamer, I've only been at this for 2 months. The most viewers I've hit in a night is probably about 30-45. I almost have 200 followers and I've recieved 1 donation. 

I've hosted many others when my streams have come to an end, while I have not received a host. My second day of streaming yielded the largest number of followers in one day because I have a unique ability that no one else has and I used it to promote myself through a video I posted on reddit. 

My tweets don't draw attention from others they only remind those who already know me of what they generally already know. 

I have reached out to others to join me on a stream, but I am small and larger streamers have no significant reason to do so, because to be fair they don't know me, nor should they. I don't have the time to communicate with them in their own streams so what fault is it of theirs they don't know a small ""variety"" streamer who ends early some nights. 

My first fanatical fan went berserk and started wishing that my family would die, insulted me and everything I do, all because he was upset. I banned from my channel the very first person who said they had faith in me. 

But I still stream. Every. Single. Night. 

40-ish hours a week I get on my computer in a rush with toast in my hand and 6 different windows open, in an attempt to get on in time. 

There is always one person in my chat. He's sometimes late, he's sometimes early. Sometimes he doesn't come at all, but tells me about the day he had on the following day and why he missed the stream. He knows who my girlfriend is, he knows all the games I've played. He knows I can do an uncanny old man impression, he knows that I can create 3d Sculptures to a degree of success. He's not there because I'm playing a new character on a new patch with a new release date in alpha etc etc. He shows up every day because we are friends. We only became friends because of the stream

My one viewer and I share a purple blooded bond because we genuinely care for each other. 

To me, this is streaming. Connecting with someone because you put the effort into it. You stick out the long hours, you put aside your own time and devote yourself to a cause because there's a chance you can meet someone who genuinely cares about you and your stream. 

Though I may get discouraged, every day the camera atop my monitor glows a cool blue to transmit my image to a site that millions of people pass through every day, in a hope that I can connect with just one. 

Streaming is *simple* but it is not easy. 

Streaming is *rewarding* but it is not instant 

Streaming is what we do. 



little edit: some people think there's some sadness or salt in this post, but there isn't. I just want people to hear what most people don't talk about. I love the positive attitude most people have when they post, and to be honest I love streaming as much as I do. But I just want people to be able to see an average-ish outlook from an average-ish streamer.

4ccs0l,TwitchAlerts and GamingForGood Situation Discussion Thread,"Greetings /r/Twitch,  
  
You may be aware of the current situation between two third-party services: TwitchAlerts and GamingForGood. We, the /r/Twitch mod team, have recently noticed a lot of discussion about the situation and the services involved. However, the majority of discussion is being limited by rule #2 of the subreddit. Therefore, we are going to try out a new way of dealing with discussion of the current situation  - where people won't be as limited to what they can comment. This thread is a central place to discuss the topic.  
  
In *this thread only* you are allowed to:  
  
- Name relevant services/users, and link to their content.
- Link relevant images, videos, or other content that adds to the discussion.

However, you are still unable to do any of the following:

- Post personal information of anyone involved (doxxing).
- Encourage witch-hunting, violence, or other forms of harassment.
- Link directly to images, videos, and other content which directly cause harassment.

**Please remember to keep all discussion civilised.**   

Also, please note that any other threads about this topic will now be removed (under rule #5) and directed to this discussion thread.  

In addition, the mod team will be checking for any attempts by the users/services involved to manipulate this discussion - to keep it as neutral as possible.

As you may have noticed we have three new moderators (u/Zcotticus, u/Sargasm_gaming, u/Decicus) we were only looking for  two, however I informed the team that I will be stepping down as a moderator of r/Twitch. I am not leaving because I dislike my position as a moderator of r/Twitch but I am leaving because Twitch has offered me a full time position.

I just want to thank the r/Twitch community for the 2+ years I have been a moderator, between all the contests I have ran over the years and all the hidden gold you might have received. It has been fun while it lasted, but it is my time to move on and let the noobs have a chance [](#Kappa). 

The highlight contests are being taken over by u/Conceptional and the rest of the mod team will assist. I will still be active on r/Twitch and always [](#bleedPurple)

4ai71p,I Streamed Everyday For 365 Days,"March 15th last year I challenged myself to stream everyday for a full year. I had never streamed before, I had no idea what Twitch held for me, but I really wanted a change in my life. I set forth on the challenge hoping to dedicate myself to streaming and make a career as a content creator. I had a lot of intentions going into streaming, what kind of things I would make, which games I would play. Those ideas change every week but I’ve finally stuck to some games that I love.

I found that I was constantly evolving as a creator and that I absolutely loved both Twitch and Youtube. I felt engaged in my work and that every moment I got to spend making something I loved was a moment that was gone too soon. In the meantime I worked a full time job as a security guard which, previously, was a job which I enjoyed. However I noticed as time went on all things that weren't streaming/making videos became less enjoyable. I was always thinking about what was next, what change to make, what my audience wanted to see. Every waking moment was dedicated to the content that I wanted to create. This has become a huge part of my life like I never expected. It is everything about me. It is how I'm social, creative, my outlet when I'm stressed. This challenge has become everything that is good in my life. 

I'm happy to tell you that last week I quit my job and I'm now pursuing being a creator full-time. At the end of this month I will officially be a full-time broadcaster and Youtuber. This is honestly an incredible amount of stress. While I have been able to save up money to support myself It is very unlikely that the size of my community will be able to support me as is and that I will need to grow rapidly in the next few months in order to even come close to paying the bills as the security job always did. I simply cannot, however, go back to doing something that I do not love when I have the chance right here and now to fulfill my dreams. It took a lot of convincing to get myself to walk into work and tell them that after three years of working for them that I was quitting. My employers have been very kind to me and have always looked out for me. I could not live with myself If I did not take this risk, if I was too paralyzed by fear to make this leap.

I want to thank everyone out there who makes this community special. I want to tell all of the gamers out there that you are amazing people. I want to let you know that you should reach for your dreams if you can. Stay motivated, stay awesome.

47vsyq,"[Web App] TwitchDeck - a smart stream player. Watch multiple streamers, with size, position, and audio controlled automatically","Hi everyone,

I wanted to take a second to tell you about a personal project I've been working on since Thanksgiving of last year. It's called TwitchDeck - available at https://www.twitchdeck.io - and it aims to provide a better stream-viewing experience through some key features:

* Watch multiple streamers - a large main player with chat panel displays your first online streamer, with others displayed below in a row.
* The main streamer's audio is automatically turned on; all others are automatically muted.
* As streamers come online and go offline, TwitchDeck moves them around the UI and manages the audio, so you can just sit back and watch.
* Optionally, sign up for a free TwitchDeck account, and you can save your favorite streamers to your profile. Quickly and easily load your streamers by visiting the main TwitchDeck URL from anywhere, and easily add, remove, and prioritize streamers in your profile page.
* Future features tied to your account will be implemented in the future.

TwitchDeck is designed for desktop, but some testing has shown limited support by mobile devices (mainly Android). I'm not officially supporting mobile at this time, but I will be looking into a supported mobile solution down the road.

TwitchDeck is a labor of love - I'm a software developer by trade, but I built TwitchDeck after-hours to improve my skills and provide a fun and useful tool to the Twitch community - one that I've become attached to. TwitchDeck is and will always be free to use, and I'll be rolling out new features on a regular basis.

If you'd like to check it out, I'd appreciate it a lot! It's available at https://www.twitchdeck.io. Additionally, you can find news and updates, and submit feature requests or ask questions at the TwitchDeck subreddit, r/twitchdeck.

Thank you for your interest! Nothing would make me happier than to see the Twitch community using and enjoying TwitchDeck, so I hope you'll give it a shot and let me know what you think! And if you REALLY like it - a share on your favorite social media network would go a long way to help! Please use the handy share buttons on top of TwtichDeck to do this.

47p4qz,For those who haven't switched to OBS Studio,"I notice a lot of people here haven't made the jump from Original OBS to OBS Studio (formerly obs mp)

The most common reason I've seen is that people just don't know about it, or still think it's not fully capable of being your main program, that it's missing many features that the original one has, and this simply isn't true anymore. They maintain it meticulously, and it has almost every core feature of the original and many more. You have a greater control of audio sources, and a volume mixer right there on the dashboard of every audio source you use. They program is optimized and run's and utilizes resources much more efficiently than the original. It's better in almost every way.

The second reason: your scenes won't carry over. I know some people aren't great with the more technical aspects of streaming, and that's okay, but you need to get this part down if you want to be successful. You already have your graphics and know what settings you use, and if you only have a few scenes, it won't take more than 30 minutes, if even that, to transfer over and set them up. There isn't any way to carry your old profile over, you'll have to set it up again, period.

I've been using OBS Studio for a few months now, and I have an older rig, and it run's great. The menu's differ, but it only adds to the ease of use.

I figure if we can push and get people over to the new one, it can only get better.

477x6p,Chat Replay - You can now see the chat messages from VoDs!,"[Click here for the blog page.](http://blog.twitch.tv/2016/02/introducing-chat-replay/)    
  
*****
  
&gt; Watching recorded video on Twitch is about to get a whole lot better, and a whole lot more like a live experience!

&gt; Over the next few weeks we will be rolling out Chat Replay, a new feature that brings the excitement of Twitch Chat to recorded videos. Now, when you watch a recorded stream or highlight, the chat from the live broadcast will show up right next to the video. Never again will you wonder which moments had the chat going wild or what messages your favorite broadcaster is responding to. With Chat Replay, you can fully immerse yourself in the Twitch viewing experience and relive the best moments from broadcasts exactly as they happened live.

&gt; Starting today, we will begin capturing chat messages from live streams, and chat messages will be gradually added to recorded videos over the next few weeks.

&gt; Chat Replay even works in Theater ModeChat Replay in Theater Mode
Chat Replay messages will display alongside videos as long as they are available on Twitch. This includes Sub notifications, Emotes, and Badges exactly as they appeared on the live stream.

&gt; If you already use the browser extension, ReChat, you’ll be happy to know that Chat Replay brings all the same functionality (and more!) directly into Twitch, and was developed with input from its creator, Nils Caspar, who officially joined the Twitch team last year.

&gt; Chat Replay also has moderation features built directly into the interface. Messages deleted due to user time-outs or bans during a live stream will not appear in Chat Replay, but, since channel moderators can’t always catch everything when it happens, anyone with permission to moderate a particular channel will also be able to delete individual chat messages from that channel’s recorded videos.

&gt; Stay tuned over the coming weeks as Chat Replay is added to videos made starting today. To learn more about Chat Replay and moderation functions, check out the Chat Replay FAQ.

472is6,For those on the fence.... Keep on going!,"So I've been streaming off and on for about a year. In November I started streaming pretty regularly. I got a few followers here and there. But then things stagnated. What was going on? I didn't know what I was doing wrong.

There would be streams where people would hop in and immediately leave it seemed. I was getting ready to throw in the towel. 

Then I remembered, I was here to stream for the interaction. I want to build a community of people who like each other and can come and work on common goals together. So it occurred to me. Why do I care if someone comes in and doesnt like what they see? I want people to like what I'm doing.

So I just said in going to just stream and have fun, and if one person comes in and says hi, I've succeeded for that day. Do I need 10 viewers? No. 

So I was churning along, and a follower hopped in and started chatting with me. He stayed pretty much the whole 12 hours minus when he went to grab something to eat. Pretty steadily my chat got more active. Another follower hopped in andbchat was going on and I was enjoying tremendously what was going on. 

Needless to say, I was on the edge of just quitting altogether until I reevaluated my motives. I'm not to terribly interesting or good at games, but over those 12 hours I got up to 8 viewers and I got 7 follows in one day. That, for me, is a huge success!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/472is6/for_those_on_the_fence_keep_on_going/,1456169678.0,54,0.84,27,Twitch,thesphyg
46yaao,How to Handle a Difficult Fan Viewer,"(throwaway account because reasons)

I've been streaming for the past two weeks, and I've got to say its going great. Hit the 100 hundred follower mark, and have about 5 or 6 viewers who come back nightly, and hit 15-20 viewers nightly. 

However, every night I have one viewer who is first to the chat, always likes my tweets, retweets, interacts with me etc. I love that he's in chat and that he helps me so much by being active. 

HOWEVER he's starting to turn into a nuisance. If I don't play the game the wants me to (playing on a different server, collecting X number of a resource) he will keep bringing it up in chat. Then when I stop paying attention to him repeating things, he starts saying he's bored. If I switch games he tries to tell me to go back to my main game because I'm losing viewers. (I only switch when the servers go down for maintenance so it hasn't happened much)

It may sound petty but I find myself constantly saying ""(viewer) I'm not playing that tonight sorry"" ""(viewer) we're not doing that today"" to the point where I feel like i say his name every 10 minutes to say something to address his nagging. 

In the end he's important to me personally because he's got faith in me and says I'm his favorite all the time, but it's starting to feel like over time people who keep coming back are going to get sick of me putting up with his constant nagging and want to leave because of it.

How do I manage him to try to curb his need to sway me to play the game his way, or do I have to start timing him out to try to show him I'm serious that he's got to stop trying to drive.

46pho7,"I'm sorry, but I just need to tell someone that may understand!","Hello! 

Before I go into things I just need to say that I havent told any of my friends family about me having a stream. My family wouldnt understand and they would probably shun it. And I dont have very many friends who would understand what I'm feeling.

I'm a relatively newer streamer. I've been streaming since December so around 3 months now. I've always had a few dedicated viewers that come and hangout with me. The past few days my channel has grown more quickly than the last month as a whole. It is very exciting and invigorating! I very much agree with, and practice, the ""dont look at viewer count while streaming"" but I can get a feel by names in chat/follows per night/stats afterward. Now this by itself is enough to make my week, and get me all giddy. BUT the past few nights I've reached SECOND in the Terraria game twitch directory. This may not seem like much to alot of you, and theres never really more than 600 people watching Terraria, or more than ~20 people streaming it. But a viewer told me this and it blew my mind. The top streamer had upwards of 500 viewers, but when I checked the directory sure enough there was my face right next to it!!

As I said I dont really have anyone to talk to about this, so I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate post, but I needed to at least type it out and tell someone :) 


I dont want to link to my channel (its different than my reddit name) because I dont want to impede.

We are launching a new feature today to help partnered broadcasters take commissions on [Twitch Creative](http://www.twitch.tv/creative). There are artists accepting commissions in all different kinds of media on Twitch including [leather working](http://www.twitch.tv/thatdanishguy), [glassblowing](http://www.twitch.tv/glassmancometh), [painting](http://www.twitch.tv/zladyluthien), and so many more. Creative broadcasters are already using Twitch as a way to sell their art and find new commissions; we want to make the process easier for everyone. For gaming broadcasters looking to improve the production value of their channel, there are artists creating unique emotes, overlays, animations and panels. The feature launching today is an open beta experiment that will continually be developed from feedback from our broadcasters and users. 

If you are a partner broadcasting on Twitch Creative, you now have access to a commission button. The button will appear on your page under the video and will allow for a private conversation about commissioning art through the whisper system. Before the conversation starts, there will be a customizable panel informing the viewer on your commission process. You can edit the info that appears when a user clicks on the commission button, providing the media, prices, dimensions, shipping info, or whatever details you want to include. When you are accepting commissions, you can also use the hashtag *#commission* in your title to show you are open for business!

This feature is still in development, so please feel free to leave feedback. If you have any questions about Twitch Creative, you can read our [FAQ](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2176641-creative-faq).

We have also [updated the dashboard, changing ""Subscriptions"" to ""Partner Settings.""](http://imgur.com/uMNYXiA) 

Happy streaming!

Twitch Creative Team

**FAQ on commissions:**

**How do I turn on my commission button?**
As a partner, you can turn the button on and off in the dashboard under ""Partner Settings"" if your current game is set to Creative. When you turn on commissions, make sure you have whispers on to allow for the conversation to take place.

**How are payments processed? How much of a cut does Twitch take?**
There are no payments processed through the commission button. Currently, the button is a way to start a conversation about commissions and we do not take a cut from any transactions that might occur through this.

46eyyb,"TwitchCon 2016 announced, coming to San Diego this September","From [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/18/11038070/twitchcon-2016-dates-san-diego):

*TwitchCon, the convention for the Twitch community, will return for a second year this fall, although not to the same place: TwitchCon 2016 will be held at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, Twitch announced today.*

*The inaugural TwitchCon took place last September at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. This year, the show is expanding from two days to three: TwitchCon 2016 will run from Friday, Sept. 30, through Sunday, Oct. 2.*

*TwitchCon will now be an annual event, said Amy Brady, director of global events for Twitch, because the Twitch community ""has outgrown our booths at other conventions."" Asked about the change in location this year, Brady told Polygon, ""We wanted to explore other locations, yet still remain close enough to our home base of San Francisco given all of the staff that will be attending the event,"" and noted that San Diego ""has a lot of experience dealing with large fan-driven conventions.""*

*At this point, Twitch isn't saying whether the move to San Diego is permanent. ""We plan TwitchCon one year at a time, so you never know,"" said Brady.*

*More than 20,000 people attended TwitchCon 2015, and that figure looks poised to increase this year with an extra day of the convention and its new location — the San Diego Convention Center is the same massive venue that hosts Comic-Con International. Brady said that ""it's too soon to predict the turnout"" for TwitchCon 2016 but that ""all signs point to a bigger draw,"" partly because ""many of our community regretted they didn’t attend last year after hearing about the experience from those who did.""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/46eyyb/twitchcon_2016_announced_coming_to_san_diego_this/,1455805762.0,84,0.94,50,Twitch,Silverspud
469kex,A Few Pieces of Advice/Tips: Part 1(?),"Hi all,  
  
I've spent a lot of time talking with people and it *seems* that people like my advice and/or hadn't considered  where I came from, so I thought I'd toss a few topics up, and if people like it and find value in it, I'll continue. Advanced warning: Long.
  
**Who/What Are You**  
  
So before we get into anything, you have to find your voice, right? You have to find out what kind of streamer you are.  
  
* Are you funny? Genuine?  
* Are you a progamer?  
* Are you a meticulous achievement hunter?  
* Are you loud and bombastic?  
  
These are all facets of your personality. There are so many viewers out there, all of them want to watch different types of streamers. **Do not** take it personally if people come in and then leave. There are so many reasons behind it. Maybe they were looking for a streamer who speaks a certain language. Maybe they had to go as soon as they came in. Not everyone is going to love you. And that's fine. You don't want people who don't identity with who you are around anyways, because they will not fit in with the community you're fostering. There are a lot of people who want to be huge now, but have streamed a short amount of time. TAKE THIS TIME. USE IT. Work on conversation, on enunciation. On how you present yourself and your stream. Amplify the positive aspects of your personality while streaming. Experiment with new ideas. We all don't crack jokes and talk when we game. We do that because we're putting on a show for viewers. Did you fuck up? Great, there's barely anyone there to laugh at you. Don't let hunger/thirst ruin that, man.
  
**Game Choice**  
  
This is one of the biggest things to consider. I've spoken with so many streamers who dream big (which is great!), but wonder why they haven't grown. I'll go in their past broadcasts and see the latest Call of Duty. Hearthstone. League of Legends. Starcraft 2. Dota 2. The latest flavor of the month game that every huge streamer is playing. If you have an average of 3 viewers playing LoL, you're probably down 200-300 channels on the list. How is anyone going to find you outside of the stars aligning? You can stream 8-10 hours a day with the greatest stream on Twitch, but if no one knows you exist... don't you think you're time investment is paying very little? I saw a channel with after a year and a half he had 250 followers. He streamed mainly League. Do the math. It will take 6 years to get 1K followers. And they are ALSO competing against the big names in that game. The pros, the casters, the personalities. And it's an ESPORT. Professional Esport streamers will ALWAYS have more support because they are in tournaments, they dominate their subreddits because of fans. The companies who develop the game they compete in are on a first name basis with them. You will, most likely, NEVER be the top streamer. Think about that.* 
  
*IF you are dead set on streaming the saturated games, you have to drive viewers to your stream from other areas. Relying on Twitch listings won't do it. Create a guide series on YouTube or in a subreddit. Hero breakdown, changes in the meta. Do some amateur casting and ask for feedback. Create a weekly talk show. Twitter like a mad man. Talk to influential people on there (don't come off hungry - they sense it). Just talk to them as equals. Over time, your name will be remembered if they respect what you've had to say. And being on a radar is huge. Make yourself available to everyone who is bigger than you. Most people will help out someone who has helped them out.  
  
**Advertising**  
  
This subreddit mod team manages [TwitchDB](http://twitchdb.tv/). When you see a person's name on this subreddit with a Twitch URL link next to it (like mine in this post), that means they've registered with that site. On the right  sidebar under ""Promote Yourself"" there is a ""Introduce Your Channel"" link. That is how you set up a TwitchDB profile.  
  
Advertising yourself is difficult. I think that networking with other streamers around your level is the BEST advertising-like work you can do. We're in this together, and helping each other out will always have positive gains. Outside of that, social media is huge. Do NOT use your Twitter as a ""live &lt;stream link here&gt;"" dump. When people check out your twitter, you want it to reflect you, your brand. You want your personality in there. If all they see is links over and over, they're gonna pass on following. I thought Twitter was dumb before I started to get into Dota 2 and hosting. I was fucking wrong. It is the most insanely powerful tool in your arsenal. You can reach out and INTERACT with people like DJWheat, ReDeYe, BadNewsBaron, Towelliee. Let that sink in. That's incredible!  
  
Also, in a related topic, you want your Twitch/Twitter/Facebook/etc. name to be the same everywhere with the same branding. The golden arches aren't just the McDonald's logo. They are symbols of memories, childhood, good times. You want a solid brand that people associate with you in a positive way. [This link goes into far better detail than I need to](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3om1y2/understanding_branding_and_how_broadcasters_are/) . 
  
I'll stop here for the moment. There are some major fundamentals about streaming that aren't discussed here, but I think there is plenty for you to digest. I'm happy to give opinions on any questions you have, but remember my stream isn't huge, nor am I as experienced as many other people out there, so do take that into consideration. Opinions are like assholes, everyone meets one. ...wait, that's not the phrase.

4616ty,Just want to thank you guys for your advice and guides. Here's what I've learned over the past 30 days and how it's worked out so far.,"I just wanted to make this post as I really appreciated everyone who has done this on /r/twitch and figured it might help others grow their channels.

There's no order of importance here but I've grown steadily by a follower a day and I've found it's not so much seeing that grow that's rewarding but building a little community around myself.

- If you're playing with friends / regular team-mates invite them to watch/have the stream on so they can see the chat. This has the benefit of bumping your channel a little higher and allows them to talk/respond to questions asked. 

- Giveaways do help a little but I've found most people don't really care all that much. The stream and the entertainment is more important to them. 

- Keep your title witty but informative. Those with an existing community can pretty much put whatever but I've found that having a joke followed by info about what I'm doing helps a lot more. 

- If your early followers are on often, mod them. I've found the first few people who started following to be pretty valuable as they've come back frequently. They know your tone fairly well and if someone starts harassing you/others they can take steps on your behalf. This helps a lot when you're playing a competitive game and can't alt+tab all the time.

- Consistent schedules. You know I didn't think this was that important until I read up on here. Now I stream around the same time and keep to it as much as I can. I've found that I draw back the regular 6-7 people per session as a result.

- Sound matters. If there's game music mute it in favour of your own if you want to play something in the background. Most people prefer just the game sound though as your taste will probably not collide with their own. Your voice should be clear and louder than the game. The game should be louder than any music. 

- Utilise your social channels. I've not done this as often as I should, especially as I'm lucky enough to have a large twitter following that tends to be into gaming. But I have found people do actually look for streams via Twitter. 

- What's your niche or angle? If you don't have one find one. It helps to be memorable and mine is apparently the virtue of being British. I own a union jack onesie (and bed covers, don't judge. Rule Britannia) and I'm pretty much raided by small groups of friends because of that as you can see my bed in the back of the stream. Which is fun and I enjoy the banter. Just let your personality show as people don't want to watch someone quietly just sit and play. It's not about how good you are but just how amusing you are and how much you entertainment value you provide.

- Webcam does make a lot of difference. Use your phone if you don't own one. [This app will help you out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;hl=en_GB) if you need help with that. The first 2-3 days I streamed I had no one sticking around. They wanted to see who I was because I'm here to entertain them. The first day I started using my webcam it then started happening for me - people checked me out a bit more. Also make sure your lighting is good and there's not too much clutter. That can be distracting / annoying for some people. Also be presentable. Wear a God damn shirt. 

[Some of you disagree pretty strongly about this, and each to their own, but seriously I think it really helps people to see your reaction](http://imgur.com/tYjT2Lz).

- Minimise your overlays/info. People don't really care for crowded screens so figure out what is important and what isn't. I do find that people appreciate the teamspeak plugin to show who is talking and when. They get to know them too so it helps to be able to make that clear. 

- Use nightbot or similar to give mods a few toys and people features. I used to have song info on the top left but since then have reduced that to a command. It helps to have common info there that mods and other regs can dole out if need be.

- Fill out your bio so people can find out more about you and your schedule. 

- If you play with others who have lesser mic quality see if you can help them tweak the settings to make it a little better. I'm lucky enough to have some old equipment that's fairly decent for recording. However using VB audio and NoiseGator I can improve on that and get rid of some of my white noise too. It makes you sound clearer and less annoying for a viewer as they hear less static. While we're talking about sound I've found people prefer push to talk as that way they won't hear notifications from my phone.

- Make friends with other streamers. I've got two other guys who stream Rainbow Six and another that streams Total War in which we host for each other when our stream ends. Make sure that they're aligned with your humour, games, and general taste before thinking about hosting with one another as people don't want to go from one experience to a completely different one. They like you for who you are and may not appreciate being shoved elsewhere. The advantage to this though is new exposure to your stream and building your network. Look for people around your viewing number and go from there. 

- Talk frequently. Even if it's just you. I've reused the same jokes, stories, and anecdotes several times (though not on the same person in the same stream) just to lighten the mood. 

- Respect your lurkers. Call outs put pressure on people. Saying 'Welcome to anyone who has just joined lately. Here's an update on current events"" etc is a lot less jarring for them. I've found naming people makes them vanish rather quickly so leave them be. 

- Keep an eye on your chat. I've found chatty a lifesaver as it allows me to keep an eye on the stream. If you don't engage with people you're going to lose them. If you can respond via text that's pretty useful as some people might disappear due to game/stream delay. 

- Have the best stream quality you can. I've had a look around other small streamers and I've noticed a trend for those with no viewers. Your stream quality is terrible. I don't mean this to be mean but simply that you need to check out some guides for how to get the best possible quality. If your stream is dropping a lot of frames and what not it's going to be rough to watch it. 

- Be careful with your personal information. Some people will make some outrageous claims about tipping and 'helping you' simply to get your information to harass you. Some people will just want to play with you but be cautious and make sure you don't link too much to your personal information. I do tend to use real name stuff primarily just because there's already a shit ton of my info out there due to my work and whatever. 

- Don't try and poach people. It's a dick move and advertising your channel in their streams is only going to earn you ire and upset their community. 

- Stream as much as you can. Stick to your schedule but for the love of God streaming longer gives more people more opportunities to find you and to grow to like you. If you're only streaming only a few hours a week you're never going to grow.

- Don't give a fuck about numbers. Viewers do matter but don't just try and grow them like a metric or a goal. Your total streaming time if anything should be your goal. It's hard for you to get past that I'm sure and yeah I do it myself but really focus on what you're trying to do as opposed to just watching that number. Do what you do. 

So that's everything that comes to mind right now. I just want to thank you guys for everything as you've really made things a lot clearer and a lot more enjoyable for me. The biggest difference I've found is not calling out lurkers. Before I used say hi to everyone but it wasn't until I read here and started to paying attention to the fact it may be best to let them be I noticed they'd stick around more. 

Seriously though. Thanks again, you guys rock!

45ud16,Is it just me or does the Gaming Talk Shows section not have enough Gaming Talk Shows?,"We've been planning a podcast for our channel, and since then I've been keeping an eye on the talk show section of twitch, hoping to gain inspiration and maybe connect with some other like minded channels. 

But every time I check in on it, it's pretty much filled with people just playing games in the wrong section, playing table games with a dozen people not talking, or the whole hot girl 'Sub Sundays' literally just reading odd comments in the chat and giggling (this was double on V day with ""Be my valentine?"" streams abundant).

Does anyone else think there needs to be a rule set or moderation here? It seems to have become the 'miscellaneous' section, and a dumping ground for what I consider to be average content, rather than a talk show section. 

I've tried to not be ranty here, the junk content pushes the section to the front page of twitch, which maybe helps the podcasters. Just trying to gauge the general opinion of the intent of this section of twitch.

Maybe a vlog section would be more appropriate for many of these streams?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/45ud16/is_it_just_me_or_does_the_gaming_talk_shows/,1455503639.0,56,0.94,41,Twitch,bambrightside
45m2g8,Language Filters And Why We Need Them,"Hello, My name is Drako and I've been partnered for a little over a year and a half. For the most part I have grown my channel just by streaming a lot, not from YouTube, networking (bad on my part), or anything outside of Twitch. My viewers have found me through the directory and that is how the majority of channels grow.
 
I'm going to ask you to take a look at these pictures of the Firewatch directory taken at 3pm EST http://imgur.com/a/VTY2S
 
As you can see there are quite the number of streamers in different languages. That's ridiculous. Due to the current state of the directory as a viewer I have to stream hop in order to find channels that speaks my language. As a streamer, I am losing a very large amount of exposure. Below I explain why.
 
There's a large drop-off in new views the lower you are on the list; if I'm the #2 stream I generally experience about 50% less followers per hour than if I were #1. This discrepancy occurs even when the leading stream is an afk viewbotter or a streamer speaking a less common language. For whatever reason the lower you get on the list the less exposure you get, regardless of who's ahead of you. That's why this is important, looking at the previous pictures you can see how many smaller broadcasters are making it higher up in the directory once the language filter is applied. This could be the difference between a smaller broadcaster getting no new viewers or having the best stream they've ever had in terms of growth.
 
I see a lot of ideas about things Twitch can do to help the small guy out there: special search tags, sort by view count, spotlights, etc., but honestly I believe one of the best and easiest fixes Twitch can do is to have streams filter by language. The average viewer doesn't want to sort or scroll; many won't even check out the next stream when the #1 is a bust. For the sake of user utility, we need a proper system that puts the streams they want right in front of them and I believe this is the biggest step that can be taken at the moment.
 
To me the issues are annoying but to a smaller streamer it's a massive road block. My stream initially grew by grinding hours in the right games to allow me to finally get lucky and hit the #1 spot and gain hundreds of new viewers. If back then the directory was in the state it is right now I honestly don't believe I would have ever made it, at least not without serious efforts outside of Twitch, which is kind of silly.
 
I'll end on saying that I think these filters are helpful to everyone. If I only speak Russian or Korean I should have the option to hide English streams and vice versa. This would allow viewers--no matter what language they speak--to have an easier time finding a broadcaster they understand. Overall, this would make the site better and help streamers to grow.
 
TL;DR, Lack of language filters are drastically cutting down exposure rates for streamers of all languages.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/45m2g8/language_filters_and_why_we_need_them/,1455390580.0,80,0.91,18,Twitch,DrakoGaming
45jdgl,Turbo Benefits,"I've been a Turbo Subscriber for almost 2 years now. I'm starting to feel as though the benefits are not keeping up with the cost.  

* Turbo only emotes. we get 5 unique emotes. however new global emotes are starting to come out more often making the uniqueness of Turbo emotes less interesting. 

* unique smiles- 2 choices. pretty lack luster with the amount of free smiles i can get on something like facebook.

* Battery Icon in Chat. just a visual item that no one understands and I get asked all the time what it means. gives no real benefit at all. we are still treated like non-subs.

* name color- that's probably my favorite feature but $9?

* Ad-Free- The biggest benefit. I'm sure $9 a month is way more than you make per viewer on twitch.

I really want to resub to turbo. I just can't see the benefit. I work on twitch all the time making art for streamers. I use it for entertainment. I feel like as a loyal member I would just like to see this Turbo Feature be expanded. Make me want it resub again.  I would love to know what other people think on this topic whether you are a turbo sub/ non-turbo/ thinking about being a turbo sub..what stops you? what would you think would make a difference?

45e19p,"Twitch is still unwatchable in Australia, and it's impossible to get in proper contact with twitch support.","For the past couple of months any twitch channel has been unwatchable due to the constant buffering and stutters. It's impossible to watch any twitch streamer without having to buffer every 10 seconds. 

Few months ago I tried getting in contact with twitch support, after sending them an email they replied with a generic botted email and gave a bunch of 'possible solutions' after trying everything they asked me to try in the email. I still had problems, they then told me it could be an issue with my ISP.

So recently I got in contact with my ISP and we ran a couple of tests and the problem was diagnosed on behalf of the twitch servers. I'd also like to add most of my friends aren't able to watch any stream due to the constant buffering and lagg (their ISP's are also varied so it's not just one ISP).

Honestly I miss being able to just sit back and watch other people stream without having to actually play a game. 

If anyone in Australia had the same problem and was able to fix it, how did you do it? (and no, I'm not a lazy cunt, I searched all over google for answers there was no legitimate answer or anything that solves the issue) 

Also if someone from twitch reads this shit, please get your shit together. 

Any response that tries solving this will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/45e19p/twitch_is_still_unwatchable_in_australia_and_its/,1455270516.0,104,0.93,66,Twitch,Doesnt_make_any_sens

It took a very long time and was extremely frustrating, but I'm glad to be on the other side. People kept telling me ""good luck"" getting them to fix it, but I was confident that perseverance and determination would win out over their apathy.

44dvof,Twitter: How to use it for your benefit.,"I see a lot of people asking about Twitter and how to use it, so I'm going to tell you how I believe it is best utilised!  
  
Twitter is so useful for many aspects of your streaming career. From going live tweet reminders for your followers, to utilising hashtags and mentions to your advantage and for networking.  
  
*****  
  
**Let's start at the beginning.**  
  
Ideally your Twitter username will match your Twitch username. Even more ideally you'll be able to get ALL of your social-media under that single name, it makes things a little simpler, but it's not necessary.  
If you have a logo or an image that is unique to you/your stream, make that beauty your Twitter profile picture. Being easily identified in the chaos of Twitter feeds is useful.  
If you have something cool that identifies you or your stream, upload that sucker to be your Twitter profile banner.  
  
Everything should be set up and looking very you. That's awesome.  
  
*****  
  
**Now on to what you should tweet!**  
   
There are a few ways that you tweet that can be beneficial to you.  
  
*****  
  
**Let's start with the ""going live"" tweet.**  
  
This tweet has two purposes. Firstly it's a reminder to your Twitch followers who follow you on Twitter that you're going live! What? They don't follow you on Twitter? Well there's a couple ways you can encourage this.   
 
* **Info Panel** Stick a panel with the Twitter image linked to your Twitter in a panel below your video.  
* **On-screen reminder** A fancy animated pop-in with your Twitter info.  
* **Have viewers interact with the tweet** Have a bot command that you update with the tweet link, get people to interact with it. It's a great way for viewers to feel like they are supporting the stream, and it gives them an opportunity to follow too!  
  
*****  
  
**OK! On to the second way the *going live* tweet is useful.**  
  
If I'm going to be playing Challenger League of Legends my tweet would look something like this:  
  
""Today's stream is live! Playing @LeagueOfLegends   
Join me: Twitch.tv/Twitch \#Challenger \#MidlaneChallenger [**Image or Gif**](http://i.imgur.com/8xhwa1V.gif)""  
  
Notice the mention (@) of the game. Sometimes these accounts are awesome and RT you, other they'll like it which you may think isn't a big deal but it let's you know you're on they're radar!  
  
Next thing is the \#HashTags. Two or Three hashtags is the maximum you want to do as more are not effective. I picked up that little nugget of gold there from someone here on the subreddit!  
You want you hashtags to be quick bullet points describing your stream. People can search these terms and find your tweet. It's a little thing, but every little helps.  
Finally the image/gif. It's been shown that you can get a **150% increase in retweets just by including images.**  
That can be pretty significant if it takes your four retweets to ten. Those 6 extra retweets could potentially reach hundreds more people.  
  
*****  
  
**Networking**  
  
Networking via Twitter is pretty simple. Go follow someone, you've now made a connection with them and can get information from them. Now if you interact with that person by replying to their tweets with positive, relevant and insightful comments. I've done this a whole lot, made some connections and got some follows back from other streamers and people in the streaming/gaming industry.  
  
*****  
  
**Thanks for watching, now hosting**  
  
This tweet is useful for reminding people who weren't at the stream that they missed it. ^^and ^^they ^^should ^^be ^^ashamed  
It's also nice for reminding people that you hosted them, they may have missed the notification in their chat.  
An example of this tweet is:  
  
""Thanks so much for coming out to the stream today! Now hosting @twitch Check them out, they are awesome!"" 
  
*****  

**Finally, your general tweets.**  
  
These depend on how you approach your image.  
You can choose to only post stuff related to your stream or streaming/gaming. This is an approach some people use if they want to completely keep their personaly life out of streaming.  
  
The other option is just to post what you want. This approach is used for people who want to have more of a connection to their viewers and let them see into their lives a little more. People can be a little more invested in your stream if they feel like they know you as a person a little better.

Hopefully you can use some of this info to make the best out of your Twitter!

4416fa,PAX South 'Streaming 101' Panel: Developing a One Year Plan,"Hi guys,

At PAX South I hosted a panel called ""Make Streaming Your Business: Developing a One Year Plan"" covering at a high level the little discussed business and brand management side of Twitch streaming. The panel was intended to offer a one-year roadmap for new streamers and existing streamers who are hitting plateaus in growth.

The other two panelists are Ed Lewis, the Community Content Manager for Frontier Developments (Elite: Dangerous), and Jared ""Disco Lando"" Huckaby, the Community Manager for Cloud Imperium Games (Star Citizen), who spoke from a developer's perspective on what they look for when they work with streamers of all sizes. 665 people were in attendance.

I hope it is useful.

43nvpf,[PSA] Stop thinking of viewers as some sort of currency!,"Hey guys, Lewpac here, (New reddit account to keep my branding consistent, you may have seen me post here on my Flexstar account) with another round of twitch real talk to share.
  
  
Let’s be honest for a minute, every day we are seeing posts along the line of **""how do I get viewers?"", ""Need helping getting my new stream to grow"" ""Is my growth ok?""** etc.


People often refer to streaming as a grind. That you put in the hours streaming and you will grow. This is reasonable advice but is not totally accurate. By streaming lots of hours you make yourself visible to a 'potential' audience and give them more opportunities to 'find' you...It does not. however, guarantee that this will happen. People need to drop the attitude of “I stream daily and interact with chat, why am I not Lirik/Towlee?”. News flash, there are over a million streamers now on Twitch, A good number of them 'stream and lot and interact with chat'

To further expand, think for a minute of the definition of a viewer. A **'Viewer'** is a single human being, who has decided that with this specific portion of their free time, is going to point a browser at your page and watch you play video games (Or paint pots or whatever, shout out to the Creative streamers) . This is their choice, not yours, all you can do is give them the chance to find you and hope that they like your stream enough that they will want to watch you some more. You are not entitled to their time, simply because you have a stream and you are putting in the hours… you need to earn their time by providing content that they want to watch. This is true for every single viewer that you encounter. 

So what are the reasons that a viewer will watch your stream? And by this I mean stick around and watch in the long term (after you have got them through the door that is) -  


* You are very good at the game you are streaming and they want to pick up tips or watch high level play  
* You are very entertaining/funny and it is enjoyable to watch your stream  
* They love this particular game a lot but can't play it themselves right now so want to watch it played anyway (In this situation you may be the only streamer or one of only a handful for this game)  
* You are streaming a new game or a game the viewer has not played but wants to check out.  
* There is an active and engaging community/chat in the stream and lots of discussions going on to take part in.
  
So now take a minute and think about your own stream, which of these boxes do you tick? do you tick none of them? Perhaps this is why you don’t have viewers. If you are in the 1-10 viewer brackets you literally could have 10,000+ other streams of the same size at any given time competing for viewers, ask yourself right now why those viewers should watch your stream over the other thousands?

**Twitch is not an RPG, Time = Growth is a common misconception that is spread too easily. ‘TIME = Opportunities for Exposure’ would be a far more accurate way to think about it. You cannot grind viewers. What you can do is produce content that is entertaining enough that people will make the choice to watch it, and then give them the chance to find it (read one of the many guides on promotion to get ideas to get them through the door)**

Anyway I just had to get this off my chest.

Peace

Lewis

43dh0y,Why do people blame Twitch so much?,"If there's one major gripe I see from (mainly) new streamers, it's that they're not growing because of Twitch. They say Twitch doesn't promote 'the little guy', hold their hand, prioritize them etc

They claim that because they lay their focus on big streamers, they're not growing.

Personally? I disagree. Firstly, every single person on the site (for the most part) started out with a 0:0 follower/view ratio. Many very popular streamers stayed that way for months before the snowball effect started.

Already well known people aside (say from YouTube or whatever), becoming popular on Twitch has nothing to do with whether you end up on the front page (99% of Twitch doesn't), or whatever.

And the sidebars are just a few live streamers that the person you're watching is following, and then a few sponsored when there's no relevant channels to display. I see nothing wrong with this: Twitch is a business. Without that business the site would shut down.

Some may not agree (and that's fine), but if you choose to down vote please put in your opinion as to why you feel the opposite, say any actual experiences of Twitch screwing you over because you are a small channel).

I personally think that if you stream for 6 months every single day for 10 hours and you're STILL not getting followers, there MUST be something that you are doing (or not doing) to hurt your channel, such as low quality, no webcam, no talking, really boring games (like Minesweeper or something) etc.

42h6zm,CrowdCast - a new way to experience Twitch chat,"CrowdCast is a Chrome extension for Twitch that I’ve been working on in my spare time. I love Twitch chat and I think of it as essentially a stadium filled with fans, so I wanted to make something that tries to capture the energy, chants, and reactions to the stream. At this point I think it’s in decent enough shape for people to start trying it out. Its core feature is that it displays (in real time) the most popular phrases being used in Twitch chat in dynamic bubbles. Phrases and emotes grow in size and intensity based on how often they’re used.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s CrowdCast in action during the player intros of the recent EG and Alliance Dota2 final:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2NYkdhvn0A

&amp;nbsp;

It also has filtering and polling features:

* Click on a phrase bubble to see all the different chat lines which mentioned that phrase.
* Create watch panels that can filter the chat based on role (broadcaster, mod, etc), username, or phrase.
* Create polls that pull votes directly from chat messages.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s still in development so please post any feedback you’ve got.

42gpx0,"Various Channel Games and ""add-ons"" for the Twitch Bot, AnkhBot - Can Be Found Here (requires mIRC - Instructions Included)","https://github.com/Blasman/mIRC-Twitch-Scripts

As many Twitch streamers and viewers know, channel bot's often play an important role in a streamers channel, as they perform many functions too numerous to name off.  One of the most popular and arguably one of the best Twitch bot's is [AnkhBot](http://marcinswierzowski.com/Code/AnkhBotR2/).  Unfortunately, AnkhBot will no longer be receiving new features from the creator.

Knowing this, I took it upon myself to learn mSL, the mIRC scripting language.  Using mIRC *with* AnkhBot, I was able to create many channel games and other scripts that safely function with AnkhBot's currency system.  There are a few channels on Twitch that are using these scripts now, but I figured that I would post here on Reddit and hopefully help out some other people that may be interested in ""upgrading"" their AnkhBot.

I have focused mainly on games, such as slot machines, a casino roulette table, and blackjack.  I have created two player games as well, such as Russian roulette, Rock Paper Scissors (uses whispers), and Word Scramble (uses whispers).  Other non-game scripts are a !hosts command that lists all your current hosts in alphabetical order... a ""!payactive"" command that is similar to AnkhBot's ""!points add +viewers"" but will only give points to the ACTIVE users in your viewerlist... an improved ""!give"" command to give points to another user... and a ""Raids"" script that automates to the process of paying points to everyone who joins you on a channel raid.

See the wiki on the GitHub for complete details and documentation on all of the scripts.  I am constantly updating the GitHub and looking for new ideas and improvements.

42cedd,"TotalBiscuit: ""I think Twitch should publicly state the reasons whenever they ban a game. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for that transparency.""","https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/690967487618359296

Can we have a discussion on this point? ""Banning games"" seems hugely inconsistent on Twitch at the moment, It'd be nice to have a reason attached to each of the banned games to explain why the game specifically was banned. With the number of banned games at the moment, this would be very easy to implement, and in the future keep on top of as more games are added.

I also don't think Twitch should blindly adhere to the ESRB ratings (Such as when banning ""Hatred""), as companies can influence the ESRB far more than an indie dev, who may get bad press and lower game exposure due to an overblown controversy, for example.

Remaining opaque on the reasons for banned games being on the list also opens the door wide up for Twitch to be pressured into allowing/disallowing certain games in the future by competing games companies. Being transparent would avoid this possibility.

Discuss?

4217y5,I feel like Twitch makes it incredibly hard to find someone to watch.,"Scenario: A streamer I enjoy just finished streaming and I don't feel like watching any of the other people I follow, but I do want to watch a stream. 

We've all been there. What do we do in these situations? We to one of the game categories on twitch, or we go to the channel list, and if we don't find anything there we either start digging through the bottom streamers hoping to find some new person that's good or we go, ""Fuck, guess I'm not watching anything here right now."" At least that's generally what I do. 

For how many streamers there are online at any given time I find that to be insane. 

Like, look at the LoL page right now:

http://puu.sh/mEgH0/5efcb1d75e.jpg

Seems like a whole lotta streams there right? Well let's look at it again from the perspective of someone looking for an English stream:

http://puu.sh/mEgIV/2c446192a7.jpg

Nothing against non-English streamers, I'm sure they put on a great show, but personally I want to watch someone I can understand. Despite having a broadcast language option in the dashboard I see no filter option in the streams list. If I'm missing it please tell me I'm blind and I'll happily go away and watch some streams. 

In addition to a language filter I feel like we should be able to tag our own streams and search for streams based on tags. What if one day I want to find someone that's funny but a few days later I want a more serious streamer? I gotta ask around for recommendations which just leads to the same popular people getting more viewers. 

The amount of effort I have to put in to find someone new that I enjoy is just not worth it at all. I imagine that plays a part in how hard it is for newer streamers to start out. Not only that, I wonder how many more viewers twitch would have if it had a half-way decent filtering/tagging system. I know a lot of the time lately I don't bother with the site if no one I follow is on. Between netflix and all the other entertainment options we have these days I imagine many people do the same thing. 

tl;dr

Please add a language filter and a user tagging system. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/4217y5/i_feel_like_twitch_makes_it_incredibly_hard_to/,1453399930.0,176,0.98,54,Twitch,Psyclone_Joker

41eaus,[inspiration] I'm hoping this will inspire small and the new streamers in the sub.,"UPDATE 1: It's incredible to see how much the Twitch sub is supporting me, one another, and our passion just from my one post! Thank you guys for the comments, support, and stories. There is a link to my video in the comments if you are curious about what actually went down on Wednesday! 

-------------------------

I've been streaming since mid November, and gosh, it was a rocky start. I wasn't getting viewers, I wasn't getting followers, and when I watched my streams I was pretty boring. A month had passed and I had maybe 20 followers. But I kept trying. I started watching more and small streamers to see what they do, and I began networking with them. I started gathering tips and tricks and I finally made progress. As of Wednesday I had 200 followers and I had 2 weeks of 50 plus follows! I was getting between 10-20 viewers each stream. I was doing it! 

On Wednesday 1/13, something big happened.

The Xbox Live servers crashed, and no one could play online multiplayer together. I had a couple of my faithful viewers in my stream, and I wanted to show them some of my recorded clips from my game DVR to kill the time. Then some of my fans started sending me their clips, and I would watch them on stream and comment. People really liked this... anyone who came in my stream would start sending me their clips, and they would wait for their clip to be played. My viewer count grew and grew until I was #1 on Halo 5! Normally I'm pumped for 20 people in my stream... but I had 173 at one point! I went from 200 followers to over 400 in one stream that lasted 8 hours. My favorite halo youtuber even bought me pizza to continue streaming! I was living in a dream. 

The moral of the story is that if you keep trying, keep learning, and keep networking, you will do it, I promise! Never quit, because eventually something will happen that will motivate the crap out of you. I will never forget the day that I held the #1 Twitch spot on my all time favorite video game, and I hope this inspires you to find your moment.

Has anyone had a favorite Twitch moment they would like to share for others?

40zyxw,1 Year of Streaming - A Review + Lessons Learned,"Hello once again! I am right at my 1 year of streaming and I thought I would give a quick update like I did at 6 months in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3cvx5f/6_months_of_streaming_a_review_lessons_learned/). I think my experience with Twitch is a pretty positive one and hopefully shows the progress you can make streaming what you love. I'll spend the first 2/3 of this post talking about the past and each month, and then the last 1/3 talking about important things I've learned that you could possibly apply to your stream!

&amp;nbsp;

##**First 6 Months Summary**
Really briefly I'll discuss the first 6 months in the event you don't want to read the other thread. I started over from scratch streaming essentially and found myself speedrunning Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction. This was a game that I really enjoyed and I loved the challenge. The WR for the sorceress (fastest character in the game) was 1:41 and that was the challenge I set for myself to beat! I worked hard and by July I had run a 1:36:14, though the WR had since been moved down to 1:35:xx by that time. By the end of July I had ~1100 followers and was starting to peak around 75-150 viewers depending the night, which was awesome.

##**Goals I had hoped to accomplish by my 1 year (right now) stream anniversary**
At this point things had been going well but I knew that I always wanted to be improving so I set some goals for myself to continue progressing in the right direction:  

1. Start getting active on Twitter - Result?: **Done!** - While I know I am not the biggest tweeter in the world, I got things setup and started tweeting out streams and little things here and there. As a result I have grown about 200 Twitter followers (~100 -&gt; 313) and that has been a great way to gain some fans, get some hosts, talk to viewers, etc. I'm very happy with this progress.  

2. Make a youtube intro video - Result? **failure** - This is one of those that I just never quite got around to doing. I think the big thing for me is that it's scary for me since I have very little video making knowledge. I still want to push to do this, or at least to get something there!  

3. Do a couple of small un-advertised giveaways - Result?: **Partly-done!** - I'm actually okay with how this goal has been accomplished. I don't want giveaways to really be a part of my stream where people expect it, but I was happy to do a couple small things here and there for people watching at the time!  

4. Find additional games - Result?: **Done and failed!** - This was actually an interesting one as I tried to expand out a little bit with games like World of Warships and other games like that, but I felt like they were too different from my normal style to really be successful. Some of the viewers enjoyed it, but a majority of them prefer me to play Diablo 2 so I never really built up good viewership in those other games. Additionally, people from those games wanted to watch me play there and not Diablo 2 so it never crossed quite well. THAT BEING SAID, I found some friends of similar size in other games (Minecraft, Madden, Final Fantasy, etc) and have actually been able to merge communities better with them by just being friends and hosting each other and what not. So I consider it a learned success.

##**August**
So now that we've covered the previous thread, let's take a look at some of the numbers for the more recent months! August was a great success as I was able to get my 100 hours in and things started to grow! I gained the most followers to date, had the most time watched to date, and was able to get my Sorceress time down even more. I really focused on sticking with Diablo 2 from this point forward and I think that helped me grow as people were able to get used to me consistently playing what they wanted to watch. Additionally, I did a long stream (17 hours) at the end of the month and not only hit a peak of 331 viewers but gained 150 followers from that day alone!

##**September**
September was a little bit of a pullback as I did some traveling and wasn't able to really stream as much as I wanted to stream. That being said, I was able to start hitting 200+ viewers here and there for peaks and my stream continued to grow at a pace that I thought might be impressive enough to reach out for partnership. By the end of the month I had applied, but I was rejected and told to re-apply in a month (which was a better note than I had received before). The Diablo 2 community was growing though, other speedrunners were starting to join in, and I knew it was crunch time! This month was also a great time for my Sorceress run as I was able to save even more time and really become competitive!

##**October**
CRUNCH TIME! As you can see from the numbers, I was really streaming hard this month. I didn't have any big holidays and wanted to get some really great numbers in before I applied for partnership again, so that's where the 144 hours of streaming came in. Streaming for so long led to some really big streams and I was having peaks over 200, 300, and even 400 (498!). I got my Sorceress under 1:30:00 which was a big goal for me and I also actually took a few of the other character records which was a lot of fun and I know the stream enjoyed! This was also the time that I started uploading highlights to my Youtube (just for archival purposes) and surprisingly things started to actually take off a little bit there and I gained a couple of new twitch followers from people who had seen my videos on Youtube. I also increased Twitter presence during this month and attached my Twitch to my Twitter. **Finally, at the end of the month I applied for partnership and was accepted!!!** This was such a crazy cool moment for me as the encoding options were awesome, having emotes and the partner button was really cool, and additionally Twitch helps you out as a partner by helping you connect with other partners as well which I thought was really awesome and has been a great way to make friends.

##**November**
Coming off of such a hot month, I was able to still stream 97 hours despite having Thanksgiving vacation get in the way. I used a lot of this month to build out even more graphical stuff with my stream. One thing that you'll notice if you watch my VODs over time is that my layout slowly changes. This happens with all of my graphics and I actually hired a graphic designer to design a new layout, some emotes, and some other llama things for me that I thought would continue to improve my stream. Additionally I had Frankerz face emotes added that fit the Diablo 2 theme so everyone could enjoy having some unique emotes in my channel. Speedrunning wise my Sorceress didn't improve this month, but I was able to get a couple of other records and PBs. I also had a new peak of 542 viewers this month and had a lot of 300+ streams which was absolutely amazing. I also noticed at this point the *desire for more* that sets in and I will talk about this later on but I really made sure I took a step back and starting appreciating everything I had every day. I think this was very helpful for my mood and attitude moving forward. Another awesome note for this month was that I got accepted into [AGDQ](https://gamesdonequick.com/) which meant I was going to be streaming in front of 100K+ people in January and going to an awesome event to raise money for charity!

##**December**
This was actually a relatively quiet month for me with the holidays as I spent a lot of time with family and preparing everything and wasn't able to focus as much time on my speedrunning/streaming. Additionally, another D2 streamer became partnered and starting really going heavy fulltime streaming and I saw this cut into my numbers a little bit because he was much more consistent than I was. At first this was disappointing to see but I got over it and I'm very happy being able to still draw crowds of 200-300+ and just doing my own thing! Youtube presence continued to grow and I really felt like I was starting to become my own individual streamer. I even tested out playing the game ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"" with Mrsllama and while it wasn't the same number of viewers I found a decent amount of the stream actually enjoyed it and I had a lot of fun. Not having to worry about partnership numbers actually was very relaxing for me and I think that helped my mood in streaming as well. Another thing that I did this month was add a push-up counter to my stream for follows/donations/subs. I always wanted to work out and get more push-ups in during my daily life, but I never found time to do it. By doing this I was actually able to use my stream as an accountability buddy and now I'm doing plenty of push ups every day! This has been successful in many ways but I think it also has been great in my mind because I want to be able to show you can play games and exercise. I think having a healthy balanced lifestyle is important and this is a way I can kind of be a role model. I know a lot of my viewers talk about doing the push ups with me or getting out and exercising because of me and there is nothing more rewarding than making that kind of a difference.

##**January (until 1/14/2016)**
And this brings us to January where I was able to stream multiple 9-10 hour stream days in a row and see huge success, including a new peak of 725 viewers. After those few days, I went off to AGDQ where I nervously managed to stream a terrible Sorceress time in front of 175,000 people. It was super scary but it was also such a rewarding experience not only for the stream but also for me personally because I was able to really engage with a lot of other streamers/viewers and in total raise about $35,000 for Prevent Cancer Foundation. Coming back I saw a lot of new faces and I also saw a lot of other people starting to speedrun Diablo 2 which was absolutely great. I love the D2 community and I was happy to be the face of it for a day to bring back a lot of old time players. I also managed to get my sorceress time down to 1:22:30 which compared to where I was a year ago (and where the WR was a year ago) is super awesome for me, but unfortunately my main competitor just kept pushing it down and now the WR stands at an amazing 1:19:09, though I think with the right luck I can beat it :)

##**A Look Back and BIG Lessons learned**
It's at this point that I want to really look back over these 6 months/year and talk about key things that I believe helped my stream, increased my numbers, and overall taught me life lessons.

1. Appreciate everything you have and don't succumb to the negative desires for more (where you can't appreciate what you've got anymore). This is sort of the attitude that I believe we see a lot of times in our own lives when it comes to income. I remember reading a story on reddit where a guy talked about when he was making 40K/yr and he could only think about wanting to make 70k/yr like his neighbor. When he was making 70k/yr all of the sudden he was wishing he made 120K. When he made 120K, he wanted 150K, etc. One day he sat down and saw he was making 175K/yr and yet he found that he was no more appreciative of that amount than when he was making 40k/yr because he just always wanted more. There is always more to want and it can overtake you. When I had 10 viewers I wanted 20, 20 I wanted 50, 50 I wanted 100, 100 I wanted 200, 200 I wanted 300, etc. I think it's fine to want to improve and grow, but at the same time reminding yourself just how amazing it is to have 300 or 200 or 100 or 50 or 10 people watching you is a great idea. I used to always watch my viewer count but half the time I don't even look or open it up now because I never want it to affect my mood and viewers can definitely tell when you're looking at it and not seeing the results you ""want.""  

2. Find your thing and make it your thing. I'm the guy who speedruns diablo 2 while talking to the chat a lot and does push ups in between runs. That's my unique thing and it's a great way I can set myself apart from others and have a fun time with my viewers. Not everyone is going to always have a unique thing immediately, but it's definitely great to watch it grow and just let things happen. For every successful unique thing my stream has, there has been at least five failed things I tried. Be flexible and respond with action to your fanbase. At one point I even created a big survey asking viewers all sorts of questions about changes that could be made, other streamers they enjoyed, and more. I used this data to improve my own stream to appeal to as many of them as I could.

3. Being consistent is a pretty big key, especially when starting out. I've streamed probably about 1100 hours and I've had some viewers who have watched me for 1000+ of those. THESE are your regulars and by providing them a regular place to hang out you are building great friendships that will always start you off with a base viewership. If they are excited to watch you stream, being away 5 days at a time with no schedule of when you'll be back will lose their interest and they will go establish a home somewhere else.  

4. Partnership is hard to get! When I got accepted every single one of my streams in October was finishing with over 200 max viewers AT LEAST and concurrent viewers (this is a stat on your dashboard) of 125+ every single stream. I also built a spreadsheet with numbers going back to every single day that I streamed to show my growth in viewers, growth in followers, followers per hour streamed, future plans, etc. This wasn't an application that took me 5 minutes to complete, I probably spent a good 6 hours compiling everything once I had strong enough viewer numbers. **YES** you will see some random girl streamer with 1000 followers and 50 viewers get partnered, **YES** you will see some guy who just got lucky and started streaming the beta of a new game get partnered within 2 weeks of streaming, you should **NOT** let this bother you or interfere with your goal. Don't worry about other people, worry about yourself. There are always going to be people more fortunate than you in life, and getting over that now is the best thing you can do. Three people just won the Powerball last night, should I let that affect me today? No, no I should not. Focus on you, focus on improving, and you will be able to get Twitch Partnership if that's what you desire. If you're not finding yourself growing or getting closer, take a step back and honestly look at the reason why YOU are preventing that. Maybe you're being too negative on streams, maybe your layout doesn't look that great, maybe it's just some random reason that you don't know but by putting up a survey and asking viewers you may find out!

5. Make friends and network. I know this starts out looking generic but I'll break it down a little further. Don't be someone who goes around interrupting streams to mention their stream, don't try and get the cheap follows, instead look to make meaningful relationships connections and things will go from there. Get involved in another community, people will eventually figure out that you stream and probably support you. That being said, if you really want to find a supportive place to grow, **FIND STREAMERS AROUND YOUR SIZE!!!!** This is such a key. You're not gonna get a host from Lirik by throwing him a host, you're not even going to really build a relationship with him at all. If you want to host up like that it can be a nice gesture but I don't think it's really a great way to grow that well. Instead, I found much more success looking for people with similar/slightly less viewer numbers than I have and just throwing hosts over there. Do little raids so that your community starts to chat with his. Make friends with his viewers, have your viewers make friends with him and his viewers, etc. Connecting these two communities allows you both to grow and is so much easier and honestly a lot more fun as well. My first 6 months I didn't spend near enough time supporting other streamers, but now I am subbed to a bunch of streamers and have made lots of friends and it came from me reaching out to them or seeing them reach out to me and reciprocating the love and attention.  


&amp;nbsp;

##**Future Ideas/Goals**
Keep improving right? Here are things I want to do going forward:  

1. Have my graphics guy re-design all of my buttons and my profile banner/logo. Right now I sort of have a mixed half and half combination of old stuff I made and new stuff he made, and I think it would look a lot more professional if it was all custom stuff done by him.  

2. Make an intro video/cut scenes!!! I think this is one of my most important goals moving forward because right now I have one great screen (my main layout) and then everything else is just complete garbage! This will definitely be an improvement when done.  

3. Get on a Twitch team with like-minded individuals and get some plans made for the future. I'm currently in the process of this one and I think it will be important for the future as growing with a network of people is just ever so helpful! Additionally, being able to share ideas and anything with each other has already beneficial and I know it will only get better the more we grow together.  

4. I need to really focus on Twitter/Youtube at this point as well. I already put focus on them before, but I think now I'm starting to actually see good progress there and I need to focus on being active. For Youtube I want to highlight probably about 5 videos per week, and for Twitter I want to make sure I'm networking and sending out additional tweets beyond the stream ones.  

5. I want to do something else with the current push up system that I have. I think it does a great job, but at the same time some days I can't get through all push ups and I'm left with spillover and such. I think possibly doing something like changing it to 1 REP (situp, push up, squat, etc) of my choosing instead of 1 push up may be more helpful, or adjusting how the numbers work may not be a bad idea. This is something I'll need to think about more. One thing I think would be interesting is having viewers be able to donate push ups to help out. So if the counter is at 200 and they tweet me them doing 20 verified push ups, I get to drop the counter to 180 or something? Could be interesting...

&amp;nbsp;

That's been my first year of streaming. I am absolutely blessed to have such amazing followers/viewers and to have had made so many friends along the way. I hope all aspiring streamers will read this story and see that you still can grow to at least a mid-level stream by simply working hard and having a great attitude. I didn't win the twitch lottery and get a host from Lirik, I didn't stream some super popular game early, I just streamed a game I loved consistently and always worked to improve. Good luck to you all and thanks for reading!  

**tl;dr:** Been a great year. Appreciate everyone and everything that happens while streaming. Never stop improving. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40zyxw/1_year_of_streaming_a_review_lessons_learned/,1452810050.0,69,0.97,68,Twitch,MrLlamaSC
40yczo,Upload/Bitrate/Present: A visual comparison for streamers,"Hey,

since ive been into testing different upload speeds and bitrates for streaming i just went all out.
I made a visual comparison of all important upload speeds, bitrates and x264 presents.

Test System:

Intel Core i7-5930k @ 4.4 GH
Gforce 980 TI Windforce

All footage is made in OBS with optimized settings for Twitch.tv
OBS settings (Ignore Bitrates): [IMGUR]( http://imgur.com/a/JQUSJ)

The video contains footage for following upload speeds:

400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000 and Unlimited 

All Upload speed segments have the correspondending recommended bitrates and buffer sizes from the OBS [estimator LINK](https://obsproject.com/estimator).

Presents are ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow and slower

All in all i made 88 test clips in the ARMA III Infantry showcase, each 10 seconds long.
Also you will see each filesize, cpu usage and a quality rating from me.

You can choose your upload/bitrate with annotations in the beginning or just run from 400 and enjoy the pixel glory.

I hope this helps some so figure out if they can stream with slow upload speeds or if they have problems with quality.

40qbam,What a day to stream,"Just saw someone who had a rough day.  Thought I'd share my experience from today.

So I was streaming Warface, a little known F2P FPS.  Well, while streaming, I get a twitch alert sound that caught my ear.  I thought someone might have donated (lol yeah right).  So I check and Crytek, the company who made Warface, was hosting my stream.  I became the #1 Warface streamer and gained about 20 followers and got a ton (around 50) viewers instantaneously.  It was pretty sweet.

EDIT:  Worth noting that I usually garner around 10 viewers max.  Peaked at 50+ when they first started hosting me and ended with around 35.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40qbam/what_a_day_to_stream/,1452658659.0,159,0.93,35,Twitch,WesTheGreat

40ei8d,In the final stretch of my One Year Nightly Streaming Challenge,"I figure I'd make a new post on the progress of my one year challenge, I last posted an update around 160 days ago and so much has changed since then. Streaming every single night while balancing a job over the last year has been one of the most difficult and rewarding things I have ever tackled in my entire life and it seems to be paying off. I have built a wonderful community and met so many awesome people that this entire journey as been worth it.

This is a followup to this post I made: https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3e0spx/what_ive_learned_after_145_straight_nights_of/ where I touched on quite a few things. This is more or less an add on/update. If anyone has any questions about certain things, by all means ask away I finally have some free time over the next few nights! I also plan on making one final update after night 365.

**Things I've Learned**

- Variety Channels can work. You see a ton of posts on this subreddit talking about the difficulties of setting up a variety channel and how their growth rates and viewership are extremely low and have almost no chance of getting off of the ground. While, these statements are not 100% false you CAN make them work. I've always been a variety guy but I learned that splitting my stream up into Variety -&gt; Regular Rotation every night was the way to go. At first I'd have Garry's Mod as my closing game and these days it's Mario Maker/Smash Bros. I've had so many viewers come by because of my regular rotation games and then catch me during my variety portions of my stream and stick around because they are genuinely interested in what else I have to offer. Some even stick around waiting for the regular rotation games and learn that the game variety is something that they actually enjoy. It's a rewarding feeling getting a ton of viewers that want nothing besides Mario Maker &amp; Garry's Mod and making them actually anticipate games like Hyrule Warriors, Dino Crisis, Resident Evil, Costume Quest &amp; Castlevania.

- Scheduling and timing out your shows is so so important. I'm not going to lie, my average show isn't that long compared to most. I'm looking at around 4-5 hour streams average where I typically feature two games. Having a basic time table of when I want to switch games and what I want to feature each stream is needed ALONG with backups. I go into each stream knowing when I'm switching games , when (and if) I'm taking an intermission &amp; the overall plan of what I'll be doing in each game. Am I doing 100 Expert Runs on Mario? Am I focusing main story on Batman? If Mario Makers servers are down (which has happened a few times) do I have a fallback game that other people would enjoy just in case?  Being prepared is something I didn't really learn to do well until I encountered countless problems.

- Viewer Numbers tanking during whatever you're doing? Don't panic. Don't cancel all plans during your stream. Follow through and worry about it later. I've had many games do roughly 15-20% of my average numbers during a stream. I always followed through and then examined my vods and the numbers closely (comparing previous weeks from the same night) and tried to figure out what went wrong. My most notable failure over the last few months is ""Just Cause 3"" which averaged 4 concurrent viewers compared to my usual 14-17. After finishing that stream I went back and rewatched my Just Cause content and noticed I could not present that game in an entertaining way such as other streamers and youtubers because my play style for an open world sandbox is probably one of the most dull things imaginable. It was a lesson learned, and one I would have never learned if I didn't follow through with my entire stream 100% and rewatched for myself.

- Taking Twitch seriously is a HUGE financial undertaking. As I type this right now I am approaching $5000 invested in my stream this year. Between games (roughly 80 of them or so), hardware (Wii U + Capture Card), giveaway prizes, PC Upgrades and things such as Premiere CC to edit together videos for a new youtube project that sits along my stream, things CAN get expensive. Don't expect donations to even cover 10% of what you put in as a small channel. If you told me just over a year ago that I'd be spending such a large amount of money to talk over games with low production values, I'd call you crazy but now I know it's not even close to crazy.

- Coffee is your friend if you do a 365 day challenge. My average schedule these days is wake up at 3pm for work. Get home at midnight. be on stream at 12:30. end stream at 5:30. Edit/interact with community until 7am. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. Without a wonderful Kuerig I'd probably hold the record for most times fallen asleep on Twitch. In fact as I type this now I'm drinking a wonderful Green Mountain Coffee: Hazlenut. One of the best coffee's I have ever brewed out of that machine &lt;3

- GET TWITCH TURBO! For streamers I can't recommend this enough. The 60 Day VOD Storage is incredible if you backup all your streams to a hard drive, are slow to highlight or want to have a huge backlog of content for others to check out! MiniK is also one of the best emotes. I love it. Turbo was a very worthwhile investment for me.

**Craziest Thing to Happen**

- Panga raid during Mario Maker. Oh my god, jumping from 25 viewers to 700 in under a second with a chat yelling ""YATTA"" will never be forgotten, but to maintain a solid 500 for the next hour was beyond belief. That one raid proved to me that I do have what it takes to entertain a large audience &amp; I thank Panga dearly for that random raid. It meant the world and I've got a few new regulars because of it. My concurrent averages have gone up a tiny bit since. Granted, due to that raid I was basically forced into playing a Panga level on Mario Maker and my innocence was lost after several hundred deaths in 10 minutes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/40ei8d/in_the_final_stretch_of_my_one_year_nightly/,1452477356.0,62,0.94,25,Twitch,SaveusAlex
40aqq7,Make a mobile webcam from your old cellphone,"As a Creative streamer who streams in a workshop setting (I do woodworking and toymaking), I found it to be quite challenging to offer my viewers a range of cameras that would let them see what I was doing all the time. Even with a wide view of the workshop and a secondary camera of my workbench, I was still constantly having to shuffle new tools into view of the cameras. I finally realized that what I really needed was a *mobile webcam*, to offer a first-person view of what I was doing. With the strong positive reaction this mobile webcam produced, I wanted to share a guide with everyone else of how you can easily throw together the same thing.   

&amp;nbsp;

This guide will probably be most helpful to other Creative streamers who work in an environment that requires a lot of movement. I've seen chefs, glassblowers, metalworkers, etc. who could all benefit from this. It has been a real hit with my viewers, and it's easy and cheap to set up. This shouldn't take more than 1-2 hours of your time to get going, and there's no cost associated with it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Materials**

* Any old smartphone with a decent camera and battery
* A piece of clothing to mount it on (I use my work apron)
* Some spare fabric, needle, and thread (I cut up an old wallet)
* Buttons or velcro
* A wireless home network
* Portable cell phone charger (Optional, but these only cost about $5-10)

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 1 - Prep Your Cell Phone**

This step is as simple as heading to the app store for your phone and searching for an ""ip webcam"". In the case of my Android phone, I use the free app actually called ""[IPWebcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;hl=en)"", but there are tons of other options available. You can use any app you like on your phone, but the stuff below is based on IPWebcam.

&amp;nbsp;

These apps work by streaming your phone's camera over your home's wireless network. Because of this, they won't eat up your precious bandwidth or slow your Internet connection. When you start IPWebcam on your phone, there shouldn't really be too much to muck about with. You should lower the FPS to 30, change the Audio Mode to disabled (since you probably don't want the phone echoing your voice), and you'll probably want to adjust the power settings some (I set it so that the screen can timeout to save power, but allow the webcam to keep running). Afterwards, just hit ""Start Server"" and then type the IP address and port that it shows you into your browser's address bar. This will take you to a page with a number of options; I use ""Browser"" as the video source since that seems be the least resource intensive and least laggy.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 2 - Mount Your Phone**

After you've got your phone streaming the way you want, now you just need to mount it. There are plenty of cell phone mounts available on Amazon, but I don't care for how bulky they are and I think they're an unnecessary expense. Since I wear an apron already in my workshop, I saw this as an easy mount. I took an old wallet I wasn't using, cut it up, and stitched it onto my apron in order to hold the phone onto my chest and leave the camera exposed. I then cut a hole in the back for the power port, and sowed on a second pouch to hold the portable charger right next to the phone. I just keep the portable charger plugged in to the phone at all times just to extend the battery life (with a cheap $6 portable charger and my old HTC One X, I get 6 solid hours of mobile webcam action). If you're paranoid about the phone falling out, just sow some buttons or velcro on to further secure the phone. You don't need to be some expert at sowing to do all this, anyone with a cheap sewing kit and an hour should be able to put together something functional (if not pretty).

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 3 - Add the Mobile Cam to your Stream**

This should be the simplest step for most. Adding the mobile cam in OBS is pretty straightforward. Setup a Window Capture in OBS and select your browser window that is running the IP webcam. Then just select a subregion of that window, and select the camera feed. So long as you use the same video source each time, the resolution and position of this feed with remain the same, so you won't have to adjust it each time.

&amp;nbsp;

...and just like that, you're done! You should now have a mobile webcam that you can trot all around your wireless network with. Where ever your network reaches, you can go with it. If you want to see what this all looks like when you put it together on stream, you can check out [my last Creative VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/banzaibaby/v/34307225). *(edit: I just noticed that the cam in that VOD lags a bit because I had forgotten to restart it, but if you check out [this earlier VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/banzaibaby/v/34299796) it will give you a better idea of what you can expect)*

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this guide has been a help to everyone. If you have any extra questions, feel free to shoot me a message here or on Twitch. Happy streaming!

3zs49p,"Male streamers cannot ""quest"" girl streamers, but girl streamer can ""quest"" male streamers?","Just now the admins basically called one streamer for this. They said that he cannot open a girl stream and ""quest"" (try to seek relationship) or call her, but the girl streamer can open a male stream and call him.

What the hell? And if he does it again he will get banned for some days.

But I guess it is ok for many girl streamers to show their tits and ass, and not get banned, not have any gaming content and not get banned etc.

3zg4zx,[Meta] Let's discuss the moderator team.,"I would like to start this with a disclaimer. I think the mod team here does a fine job. Maybe not the best (polandball mods win that), but definitely far from the worst. 

However, the cat choking incident did show something that I find to be really shitty. Despite all claims that this is an unofficial subreddit and that the Twitch admins that sit on the mod team are only here as redditors and not Twitch staff, when it comes down to it the Twitch admins will 100% act to protect their interests as Twitch staff, and not in any way to protect the interests of this subreddit or it's community. 

I feel it's a big conflict of interests for Twitch staff to moderate this sub, especially if it's ""unofficial"". This latest incident is hardly the first time that the mods twisted the rules around in order to benefit Twitch. 

As it is now, half the moderator team are Twitch admins. 3 of the top 4 mod spots are Twitch admins. I would like to see a bit less of them, or significantly more mods that don't have an obvious conflict of interests. 

In addition, I think it's way past time that some of the vagueness of the rules be dealt with. I think we need a clear definition of what a witch-hunt and call-out is, so that they cannot be used anymore to just nuke anything the mod team doesn't like. Also, we need transparency. If a post or comment is removed, the author and community should know why. There's plenty of examples of automoderators being programmed to leave a response as to why something is removed in other subreddits, and there's no reason we can't have the same here. 

Ultimately, I feel we need to decide if this subreddit is going to be a tool for Twitch staff to control their company's presence on reddit, or is it an actual reddit community for those who watch and broadcast on Twitch. If it's the latter, then I feel we can no longer allow those with a greater interest in protecting Twitch to run our community.

Will she get banned? Let's make a checklist.

- Obnoxious outfits on every stream

- Sub button

- Attractive (questionable) female

Well, all signs point to no based on our checklist. 

This girl deserves to be banned LONG before this. She used to be a literal camgirl where she did acts with stuffed animals and took donations to get naked. Just like a certain other female streamer, she'll probably just get a warning and absolutely nothing will happen.

3ywfd4,Considering Streaming Undertale? Be Forewarned!,"Undertale is a game with a passionate fanbase, and that enthusiasm unfortunately tends to come out in all the wrong ways when people are watching someone play the game for the first time.  Spoilers can impact the experience significantly, so I suggest being prepared - **Undertale is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible**.  Note that this will affect even small streams.

Ideally, you'll have a mod that knows the game well ready to purge aggressively.  Purging (1-second timeout) lets spoilery content get hidden from the streamer while still letting people chat mostly freely.  Most spoilers aren't malicious - usually people simply aren't thinking about what they're saying, so I suggest giving them the benefit of the doubt in general.  (Obviously longer timeouts can be used as appropriate.)

I also like re-enforcing the idea that purges aren't punishments - they are merely to hide potentially spoily information from the streamer.  This can somewhat help curb bad feelings people might have about having their text deleted.  *Edit:* You can also set up BTTV for quick modding - clicking a name then pressing P is a super-fast way to purge stuff.

A good additional layer of protection is to simply hide the bottom ~2 lines of your chat from view - this gives your mods more time to purge stuff before you can see it.  Another thing I've seen used to good effect in some streams is a separated spoiler chat - this gives people a free place to talk openly, and can easily be set up in something like Discord.

So, that said - Undertale is an amazing experience I recommend very, *very* highly - just be careful streaming it or your experience could be dampened severely =)  And it's still on sale on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/) and [Undertale.com](http://www.undertale.com/) for another couple days!

Finally: I will personally volunteer to help mod blind Undertale playthroughs for people who need it, given I have the time free to do so.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3ywfd4/considering_streaming_undertale_be_forewarned/,1451559393.0,58,0.83,32,Twitch,Twinge
3ysyhx,Made a voting site that allows users to vote directly from chat - Need feedback!,"I noticed many streamers share links in chat to vote on different questions. I thought it would be cool if streamers could ask questions and people could vote on them directly from chat, so a friend and I added twitch integration to a voting site that we have been working on.

It even has an overlay that the streamer can set this up in OBS/XSplit which will only show up when they have an active question. Users logged in to chat can vote by typing the option they want. You can also just share the link for others to vote similar to strawpoll.

3yi9xo,My 3rd Year as a Streamer,"Hey Everyone. I'm a long time lurker with a handful of posts and I wanted to take a minute to just talk about everything I've learned from twitch.

**What I've Learned as a Caster**

* Your viewers are people, and the good ones are friends. Treat them as such
* You're an entertainer, and the show must go on. Things viewers do aren't to upset you but to effect the caster
* Your channel is a show, treat it as such. Make it fun and remember there is a difference between a high school play and Broadway
* Decide in advance if you cast for fun, or for fame. Don't ride the line, because you'll set yourself up for disappointment that way
* Don't be afraid to break the norm and rock the boat. As long as you have fun, so will everyone else.

**What I've learned as a person**

* Be yourself. You can't please everyone, but the ones you do will be priceless friends.
* Know your audience, you can say whatever you want but who you say it to makes all the difference.
* Don't be afraid to move through the world confidently. Your pretty amazing, and not as many people as you think will disagree

I hope that everyone here, no matter where your at. No matter what your numbers are, Your still loving twitch, and growing.

3xwwj2,How to become a Twitch Global Moderator/Admin v2.0,"As some of you may recall, [I wrote a guide on how to become an Admin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2f77aw/how_to_become_a_twitch_admin/) quite a while back. Since then a lot of things have changed, and a lot of things have stayed the same. So, without further delay, here is the updated and revised guide on How to become a Twitch Global Moderator and Admin!

***

***First of all, what exactly does it mean to be a Global Moderator or an Admin? What's the difference?***

Global Moderators are carefully selected volunteers, retired Admins, or members of the team who for one reason or another could not join the Admin team. They are part of the same team as the Admins and relevant Staff members, and are privy to a lot of insider information. They help out in whatever way they can, whether it be translation, tool creation and maintenance, or voting for a group decision. They serve along with the Admins as a valued focus group for opinions and bug-hunting. Global Moderators are not paid, but neither do they have any direct duties that they must perform as part of their job.

Admins are selected from the Global Moderators, and are hired part-time by Twitch. They're not *exactly* Staff, but due to their close connection with Twitch itself, it's very common for Admins to eventually take positions at Twitch HQ. Admins have varying duties, ranging from shifts of reading and handling reports, taking care of spam, or moderating large events.

***

***So, now that's done, how do you become a Global Moderator?***

First of all, it's very much a ""Don't contact us. We'll contact you."" type of situation. There are no open applications, there is no list where you can sign your name, and there's no secret word you can whisper while making it rain to become a Global Moderator. Candidates are either referred by Twitch Staff/Admins/Global Moderators or approached based on what we've seen of them so far. This can be for any type of activity, whether it be support, community leadership, or being an awesome tool creator.

Once they've been contacted, they're sent an application form to fill in, which is evaluated by a secret group of people stroking white cats in their lap, sitting in a dark room deep underground. Candidates either get accepted, or declined. Those accepted are taken through boarding procedures and are invited to the team.

***

***How often are new Global Moderators added?***

The number of people invited to join the Global Moderators varies pretty wildly. Depending on the circumstances such as demand and candidate availability, sometimes only only one or two are added, while at other times a whole bunch join. The number of new Global Moderators per year doesn't really matter. What matters is when Twitch is looking for new members; Always.

***

***What is Twitch looking for?***

This is the most important bit. It doesn't matter how many Staff members refer you, if you don't have what it takes to be a Global Moderator. If you do have what it takes, you're going to be noticed or approached sooner or later.

Because Global Moderators &amp; Admins do have access to both more power and more insider information than regular users, it's absolutely essential that we have both discretion and and at the very least a better than average public image. Twitch does not want people who abuse the tools we are provided with, or people who act like jackasses in chat. We're not expected to be on the level of the Royal Guard (we are allowed to swear!), but at the very least positively represent our badges. Global Moderators and Admins do not speak for or officially represent Twitch, but in the end what we say will end up being interpreted as Twitch's stance on things. Because of this, being good at public relations is a very good skill to have.

Twitch also does not look for people who are looking to become Global Moderators as a sign of status or for the power alone. Don't get me wrong: There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be a Global Moderator or Admin (or to have it as your personal goal), or even show it off a little when you finally get there, but if you want it *only* to impress others, you're probably not what Twitch is looking for.

Languages and other unique skills such as programming, scripting, etc, are all wonderful bonus skills to have, but are not generally specifically sought after.

Finally, what would I say is the most important skill of all? Common. Sense. You'd be real surprised at how often judgement calls are required in our branch, and because of this common sense is extremely important. Global Moderators &amp; Admins need to be able to put themselves in the shoes of somebody else, to see things from multiple angles, and figure out an opinion of their own despite being told things from both sides of an argument. This is what enables us to keep one of the biggest streaming websites in the world clean and a friendly place for all!

3xrfrh,"Introducing my new site, twitch.center, a set of simple yet useful tools for both viewers and streamers","Hello /r/Twitch,

Over the past year, I've been developing various tools related to Twitch for friends, and now I've finally gotten around putting them all in one comprehensive page and sharing it with the whole community! I present to you:

## **http://twitch.center**

As of now, there are 8 different tools, + an extra one for the holidays, but I have two others in the works and would love to hear suggestions from you guys for more!

Most of them make very simple use of the Twitch API, but having a simple user friendly interface is handy for people who don't want to mess around with URLs.

Here's a quick list of the current tools along with a short explanation:

- **Patreon Alerts**: This is probably one of the most complex tools. If you use Patreon as a sub button alternative, it'll be useful for you. It uses Patreon API to send pledge alerts right into your TwitchAlerts.

- **Quick Unfollow**: Ever wanted to clean up your follow list a bit, but had to load each persons profile one by one manually? Well this tool shows you your entire list and lets you unfollow with a single click.

- **Snow Overlay**: This is something I threw together quickly last night for the holidays. Helps you add decent looking snow overlay on your stream. Uses an awesome JS library and really shows the power of CLR browser.

- **Follow Date**: This is very basic and most chats have it on their bots, but if they don't, or you just don't want to spam chat, you can quickly check how long a user has been following a channel here.

- **Sub Time**: This one is for partners. It'll show you a full list of your subscribers along with the time when they subscribed. Can be handy.

- **Steam Finder**: This let's you either find the Steam account attached to a Twitch account, or vice versa. Another basic use of the API, cleaned up with a simple interface.

- **Access Token**: This one is for developers. There are tools to generate access tokens for chat, but this lets you make them with any scope. Handy if you don't want to do the whole OAuth dance yourself.

- **Host Check**: This tool let's you see who is currently hosting a given channel. Another simple use of the API, but doing it manually can be annoying.

- **VOD Cutter**: A clean tool for getting the raw video files from a specific time section of a VOD. It doesn't convert it for you like TwitchDown though (can't afford the server costs), but if you know how to use ffmpeg, it's pretty easy to do it yourself!

Of course, if you run into any issues or bugs, feel free to either leave a comment here, message me directly or use the feedback form on the site! I'm really exciting to share these with others, so all feedback is welcomed.

3xbz15,So viewbotting is allowed? A 4500+ upvoted thread reached #1 on /r/all two days ago with included proof of a CSGO streamer viewbotting and he's getting away with it?,"For the past weeks there has been a threads and 1 in particular in /r/globaloffensive that shows proof that certain streamer is viewbotting every single day.

It has over 4500+ upvotes and even reached #1 on /r/all, and twitch isnt going to do anything about it? so viewbotting is allowed as long as you have a sub button? The thread includes  graphs and proof of how this certain streamer is using the viewbot to boost his viewercount to sometimes the most-viewed streamer on the CSGO sub.

How is what this certain streamer is doing fair? Wasn't twitch against these type of things or does twitch only ban those RuneScape viewbots that try to phish you?

Im not naming anyone and if anyone but its on the csog subreddit.

It's a shame nothing has been done about this person already.

Edit: So according to everyone here there is someone that is stalking this dude so much and is willing to spend so much money that said person instantly buys him views from a viewbot RIGHT when he starts to stream? Gee, I wonder who would do that.

And he also just talked about this so I wouln't be suprised half the comments are his fanboys on here - he needs to stop viewbotting.

I'm thinking about starting my own channel now and buying myself 5k viewers everyday and just play it off as if someone else is doing it.

3vy47l,Hey streamers! I created a tool to keep you engaged with your viewers by letting them add songs/vote on what song should play next on your stream,"Hi fellow streamers! I made a music app for streamers so people can add songs and vote for what should play next on your stream. 

&amp;nbsp;

**http://ambiant.io**

&amp;nbsp;

All you have to do is login with your twitch account, give a name to your radio and you're all set. Give the url of your radio to your viewers and they will be able to add music to your playlist and vote for what should be the next song. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What people can do :**

&amp;nbsp;

- Add songs to your playlist
- Upvote/downvote songs (most votes will play first)

&amp;nbsp;

**What you (as a radio owner) can do:**

&amp;nbsp;

- ban users
- ban songs
- adjust radio threshold (how similar to the current playlist should be the songs playing next)
- limit submissions per user
- select who can add/skip songs (everyone - twitch users - followers - subscribers ...)
- play songs by date added or by number of votes

&amp;nbsp;

**What will the radio do :**

&amp;nbsp;

- your radio will never stop, if the playlist end, it will automatically add new songs related to what you are listening

&amp;nbsp;

**Where the idea come from**

&amp;nbsp;

I was working at a web agency not so long ago, it was a big open space and we often would put some music for everyone to enjoy, from a laptop plugged into some decent speakers via spotify, songza, itunes or whatever people would choose. But I remember at the time, there was this song that was coming up repeatedly (4-5 times a day), a really annoying song that everyone hated and someone would have to get up , walk to the computer and hit ""skip"" every time. That's when I realized that there should be a better way to handle this little inconvenience. There wasn't (nothing free and easy to setup that I know of). So I started developing this project in my free time, an app (website) that could easily:

&amp;nbsp;

1 - let people add songs to a radio from their computer/phone, even remotely

2 - let people skip songs from their computer/phone

3 - will continue to play related music after all songs are finished

&amp;nbsp;

So I started working on this, and two or three weeks later I had something functional and everyone was happy. I started using it at home when I had people coming for a beer, and we had a lot of fun using it at home/work. That's when I though, as a former streamer (well if I can call me that, my viewers were basically just my friends), that this project could be useful for streamers as I remember that I was often asking my viewers to tell me what they wanted me to play as background music, and that there wasn't a really good service to handle this kind of ""collaborative radio"". So I started working on that. Evolving my project to give, not only streamers, but any live event, a service that would fill this need.

&amp;nbsp;

It's kind of in a beta state right now, so give it a go, tell me what you think, what feature you would like to be added, if you see any bugs, etc. I'm open to all kind of critics and I just want it to be something that people found useful and enjoy using.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** A lot of feature requests, you can follow my trello to see what I'm working on : https://trello.com/b/CFYHFEDK/ambiant-io

Thanks everyone for trying it and for your feedback!

**TLDR:** I created a [music app](http://ambiant.io) that let your viewers have a certain control over what music is playing during your stream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3vy47l/hey_streamers_i_created_a_tool_to_keep_you/,1449592882.0,143,0.93,116,Twitch,staticx99
3vthu2,I'm making an open source physical control panel for Twitch broadcasters. Take a look and let me know if you find it useful.,"In the past month I've been working on making a control panel for Twitch streamers. I call it the Modeck, and it's a small device that sits on your desk from which you can control your Twitch stream. 

Sometimes you need to change the sub only mode, slow mode, or play a commercial on your channel, I find it slow and distracting to interrupt the stream and type long mod commands into chat, that's why I designed dedicated controls for those functions. Also, there are 6 switches that you can assign your own functions to it, like sending chat messages or act like a keyboard to send hot keys to control applications like OBS and XSplit. Take a look at the gallery:

http://imgur.com/a/pS2iP

The great thing about Modeck, in addition to those features you just saw, is that it's completely open-source, so you can contribute to the project, or make one yourself if you want. It's also cross platform and doesn't need drivers on all systems. 

Right now this is my personal project, and I appreciate feedbacks on what you think about this project. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have. So take a look and let me know what you think.  

If you want one, I might actually be able to make a couple of them, but since it's just me right now the number will be very limited. I might look at slightly larger scale productions if this blows up, but for now, just let me know.

3vlf59,/r/Twitch now has a Discord chat [beta!],"============
mmmmm..Discord!
============

That's right, we now have a discord chat which you can join. Currently, things are being beta tested. We are not sure if this will be a continuing thing, but we decided to test it out and see how it goes at the very least.

============
The rules
============

The same subreddit rules apply, except we'll allow twitch channels to be posted in LFG as long as it does not end up in link dumps. if it does, we'll do something about it. we do not want things to become spammy.

Moderators may be seen in all chat rooms, please be aware they may not be at their computer, or in a position to talk about the subject in that room at the moment. I am **not** making it a requirement for the mods of this sub to be there. Please do not private message them with questions that can be asked in the chat rooms. For sureddit related issues, use modmail instead!

Additionally, if you see staff, global mods, admins in the chat please be respectful. Do not bug them about twitch related issues that can be answered elsewhere (IE: by contacting support) if you are unsure of anything that might be a rule breaking issue, feel free to message me first.

If you are a staff, admin, or global mod and would like to be added to the appropriate groups, reach out and we'll add you!

============
The rooms
============

Right now, for chat rooms we have what you might expect. 

 - ""hangout"" is where you can just chill. 

 - ""Techsupport"" is for technical questions you might have. 

 - ""advice"" is where you can get advice on your stream, how to run it, maybe how to manage a mod, etc. 

 - ""developers"" is for the code monkeys who want to get  together and make fun of PHP, be repulsed by perl, or collaborate on code.

 - ""LFG"" is where you can try to find other folks to dual stream with, or just play some vidya games with!

3vg915,Don't get lost like I did. :),"I am a Disabled Veteran.
For the last 15 years, I have suffered a series of defeats of both the Body, and the Mind.
On December 3rd 2012 I began a journey. 
I claimed this journey was to help free my mind of anxieties that have grown over the years due to my disabilities.
I convinced myself the solution to my problems was to force my self to be more social.
To put myself out in front and seek the attention I thought I needed.
You see, I've always considered myself to be a support person. Never leading the way but helping others.
But there was just one problem, My body wasn't physically able to cope like it used to.
So I looked so Social Media.
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, were all ultimately not the right platform.
And then I found Twitch.  
Twitch was a marriage of Ideas that I thought was the right platform.  Being Social while Gaming.
I enjoyed playing games and so I thought... Let's do this.
I gathered all of the tools I thought I needed to help.
I looked, I listened, I learned and then I leaped. 
What happened was exactly the opposite.
I couldn't have been more wrong.  
The Truth is, I lied to myself.

For a while,  it was great.  I was having fun and meeting new people.
From the beginning, I was never interested in a large audience like many others had.
I thought I would cave under the pressure (and I would have in all honesty)
So I chose to keep it simple,  play games that interested me, not advertise and just roll with it.
I didn't like the massively complicated layouts people had so I chose to just show the game I was playing.
I met some really great people along the way.
I was convinced I made the right decision.

I continued to learn and realized that I wanted to present myself better.
So I invested into better Audio and Video equipment.
I even bought a second computer to offload the strain from Streaming on my gaming computer.
Thousands of dollars have gone into this since I started.
I felt confident I was on the right track as I had met people, gained new skills, and everything was going to plan.
And then in November 2015,  I crashed... Hard.  
I Crashed So hard that I honestly felt like committing suicide.
I felt so empty, so alone, and that I had just wasted the last 3 years of my life.

How could I feel this way?
I looked around.  In the real world, I looked around and realized something.
I WAS alone.
I came to realize what i had been really doing for the last 3 years.
I was hiding from my life.  
I was hiding from my pain, my responsibilities, and my own well being.
I also realized that I became the thing that I hated about other people.
I became a self important sack of shit.

Over the last few years I had forgotten many things:
How to be humble, how to listen, how to care, how to smile and mean it, 
how to enjoy life, how to take care of myself, and ultimately how to communicate properly with other people.
While I have always been opinionated, I've never thought of myself as having the only opinion that mattered.
Yet that's what was happening.  I was just speaking like everything I said mattered. 
Whats worse is,  this started impacting reality.  I became flippant, quickly irritated and brash when talking with co-workers.
I didn't seem to care what other people thought and would get pissed off at how my ideas weren't being implemented.
I found myself getting way too angry at everything and the speed at which the anger set in was quickly increasing.
I also... simply didn't care.  
I didn't care that I my Bills would often be late.  I didn't care i showed up late for work. I didn't care that I wasted money.
I didn't even really care about my health anymore.  

So here I am, 3 years after I started this journey, writing this note.  2 Weeks after I made a decision.
I decided that drastic change needed to occur. 
I decided I have to Get Back to the reality that is my life.  
So for the last 2 weeks, I have been minimizing my time in both Streaming and in Gaming.
The last 2 weeks I had been preparing my self mentally. Taking small steps and re-evaluate things I HAD to get done.
This led me to December 4 2015.  Today.
I was able to do something today that I had not been able to do for a while. 
I felt good about myself.  
I was able to feel good about myself because For the first time in 3 years, I stepped back up and took responsibility for myself.
I was able to accomplish several things in a single day that It had taken me a year to do.
And you know what?  It felt wonderful. 
I smiled, I had enjoyable conversations with total strangers, and didn't get even the slightest bit angry.
 (except at the jackass in traffic but that's another story)
 
After today, I am going to continue on a ME plan for a couple of months while limiting my time gaming/streaming.
I am going to get my health back on track.
I am going to get back into my past hobbies of Photography and Leather working and Just do my best to start enjoying life again.
I am going to succeed.

With that said,
I am not going to cut out twitch completely as I don't think that would actually fix anything. But I will limit it.
I might even pop online here and there while I'm working on my pictures and just chill.

So why am I posting this?  
Who knows.  Maybe this will help somebody who's going thru a similar situation.
It took me 3 years to realize that I was hiding from my problems.
Twitch is a wonderful tool and can bring people together in a great way.

3v8e95,OBS Plugin: Twitch Switcher,"Howdy all,

Spent a bit of time making this plugin for personal use, figured it'd be useful to some.  


This will automatically update your Twitch game and status based off of your current scene.


A Twitch.tv OAuth key is required with channel_editor scope. You can get such a key at ( http://scacht.com/twitch )


Example of the setup page in action: 
[Example](http://i.imgur.com/IYdipRE.png)


Installation: Drop the contents of the zip into your main OBS folder and agree to merge/overwrite. 


Setup: Add your OAuth key in the field, and configure as above (for example) and click apply. 


Outcome: Based on what scene is active and what you picked, your Twitch.tv ""Title this broadcast"" and ""Game"" fields will be updated accordingly.  Pair it with Scene Switcher for fully automatic updating.

3uon9l,Do the rules have no meaning if you have 10k viewers?,"To avoid calling out or bashing the streamer(s) involved I will keep this nameless.

Tonight it was pretty disgusting to log into twitch and see a wanna-be cam girl at the top of the viewers list for CSGO. 

This streamer in question had 10k viewers, was in a leotard, drunk, and asking for her viewers to pay $100 and she would take a shot. 

I don't believe this streamer ever played a single game, just opened a case every 10 minutes or so inbetween ass shaking and chest squeezing.

When another popular streamer played an oddshot clip on his stream (That came directly from the streamer in questions stream not 10 minutes earlier) he was warned against a ban by a Staff member if he played any clips like that again. 

This is unacceptable for a game streaming platform.

3u81z9,The importance of networking,"Hey guys,

So I was reviewing some helpful threads on here, and noticed there is a huge lack of information on this amazing tool to get your stream noticed, and give people at to at least come visit.
I wanted to go ahead and extend how I feel about networking, how it's helped me, and how I plan to continue to use to bring fresh new viewers to my channel.  **THIS IS 100% MY OPINION AND WHAT WORKS FOR ME, THIS IS NOT A SURE THING FOR EVERYONE**

**Background**

I have been streaming since September, but I have been a very long time lurker of twitch, Reddit, YouTube, basically the whole online gaming commentary scene.  I had very good success with the help of other streamers advice.  I currently max out around 160+ concurrent views (when sxyhxy isn't on)  and usually around 75+.  This is absolutely crazy for a new streamer.  I feel majority of my success was networking myself out the right way!

**What is networking?**

Networking is the interaction with other people (in this case other twitch viewers) to exchange information and develop relationships, this is usually to furthers one’s personal path, whether that is in the business world, or here on twitch.




**Why is this important?**

Networking is extremely important, because when you start on twitch, you will more than likely be 5 or 6 complete scrolls towards the bottom of the game page (depending on the game)  without networking, chances are, no one will view your channel, and you will get discouraged and quit.





**Where can I network?**

Anywhere.  There are just good ways to do it and bad.






**the bad ways to network :(**

I wanted to start off with bad, because I need to create some sort of urgency on why these are bad, why you will tarnish your name, and why people still to this day do it.

* **Spamming**  this is spamming in game, spamming on message boards, others twitch channels ect. 
This is a huge no-no.  Spamming in game isn't terrible, but you are 100% setting yourself up for trolls to come and destroy your community.  I usually throw a plug after a Heroes game if I did crazy good,  but this is more for the urge to have others come join my community to actually play with me in game.

* **The bad part of twitter**
I see this so much, new streamers will tag top streamers when they begin streamer, you can usually tell when their tweet looks something like
*Going live!  twitch.tv/flacid_pen1s  @summit1g @lirik @trick2g @sxyhxy @Angrypug_*

* **follow for follow.**
This is such a dumb way to ""network” honestly having 20,000 followers is not going to get you more viewers. Ever

* **stating you’re a streamer/asking for advise**
I see this too, it’s usually a nonchalant approach via twitch, it usually goes like this
""Hey man, any tips for new streamers?""

Though it is 100% okay to ask other streamers for advice, there is a time and a place, asking in the middle of their stream, or even worse, throwing it on a donation alert, is selfish.  The streamer shouldn't have to answer questions like that while working.
That is literally like going to a football game, and stopping Tom Brady as he's just done warming up, and being like.. Hey man I am a new football player, can you show me how to throw a ball real quick?















**The good way to network :)**

* **on twitch**
This can be very easy for you, the twitch community is amazing, and they will reward you for making their jobs easier.  You do not have to push the issue, other streamers can easily ID if you're a streamer, or if you're starting out.  I for one will random view my viewer’s channels, check out their streams, and throw follows if I deem needed.  I also host my viewers all the time.  I know other streamers do this too.  Want to get noticed by a streamer, or even get mod for a high rated channel?  Ask yourself this question.

*How can I make this streamers life easier?*

The rest will come naturally


* **Twitter**
Twitter, if used right is an amazing tool to network, I use twitter literally just to network.  My advice here, let your personality show, (unless it sucks) I usually will comment, like and retweet a ton of funny posts, or if my little stream squad goes live.  Want a streamer to retweet you?  Try to take a picture wearing their tee spring shirt, or Photoshop their face onto a horse, or something.  Anything to draw their attention, a retweet from them goes a huge way,  majority of big streamers have over 10k followers,  that's 10k people who will see your tweet.  I went from 0 followers to 343 in the matter of 4 weeks using this method.  

* **on Reddit**
Okay, so we can't advertise on Reddit, but I have gotten at least 100 followers from just being on here, I have people randomly finding me in channels, saying ""Hey Chester, I saw that post you made on Reddit, awesome job""  Reddit is a extremely good tool to network, just don't break the rules.  Not every post on here is looking for an expert to fix their issues, majority are just opinion based.  So give them your opinion!

* **Youtube**
Make a funny video, or something you did insane, upload it to YouTube, and send it to your favorite streamer,  many streamers play videos live on their channel.
Here is my [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQQqwwbdVE) of how I did it.
This video was just me goofing around in Sxyhxys private h1z1 server,  so I sent him this, he played it, chat blew up in ""lawls""  and it hit 4000 viewers, for a 20 second video,  I got at least 6 followers for this, (that I know of) and it was a blast.  This video literally took me 30 seconds to record and upload

* **Hosting**
Use the hosting tool in twitch to host other small streamers, this can create a sort of network of small streamers that are all there to help boost each other up.  This is extremely effective and if you're not taking part in this, you should really ask yourself, why?

* **Ask for help!**
Shoot a mid-tier streamer (maybe someone close to getting partner) a quick message,  ask them what works for them,  ask them to watch one of your VODs  take their advice and improve your channel based on it.  Manpons did this for me, and it was not only really super good advice, but he made me feel like I could accomplish my goals when I was feeling down.








I want some more examples below of how you guys network, hopefully I can get some more ideas on it.  This is just what works for me, and I wanted to share it with this awesome community.

3ty2rr,kinda tired of hearing it,"So,  I lurk here a ton, and post here sometimes trying to provide moral support for those struggling.  Now with that being said, I've spent the last 4 days going into new streamers channels (I am talking under 500 followers,  under 10 concurrents) just to try to spark some kind of communication, maybe throw a follow and a small tip.  **two of them even made recent posts here about exposure**

*This is what I saw. I blanked out names due to obvious reasons*


**Channel 1: H1z1**

*Action:  Chat*

Streamer looked at the chat, looked mad that I was even there, and just kept playing.  So I left after 5 minutes with no response


**Channel 2: H1z1**

*Action: Followed/chat*

Streamer had nothing to signify the follow,  though he did thank me, it didn't feel genuine,  he didn't even read my name right, he said ""Chesthumble"".  also didn't read chat


**Channel 3: HoTS**

*Action: Followed/chat*

This channel had a few viewers already,  so I just popped in and hit the follow just to see.  a He had a bot automatically set up to say thank you, so I guess that was good enough for him, since I didn't get a personal thank you.


**Channel 4: HoTS**

*Action: Chat*

Left/reported because every 3rd word out of the guys mouth was a N bomb..  pathetic


**Channel 5: Overwatch**

*action: tipped/follow*

I only did this because the guy had a really awesome beard, and as a bearded man, I felt it was needed.  This guy did thank me for the follow and acted surprised at the tip, but after that,  he just provided me a 1000 yard stare at the screen, and breathed in the mic.



**my point is,  people are willing to give new streamers a chance,  but these streamers, instead of being self-aware and trying to provide an amazing stream, do not care, and would rather come here and write a novel complaining that twitch is ""too hard for new streamers""  and ""unfair"".**

3ta1e9,"STOP THE ""How do I get big"" ""How do I get viewers"" POSTS PLEASE","This post is for anyone thinking about making a post asking any of the following; ""Any tips for a new streamer?"" ""How can I get viewers."" ""What do I talk about with no viewers?"" or anything else like those questions. Asking for advice is fine but there IS a search function on this very website called reddit guys! You can search for whatever question you want to ask and find 100 other threads asking the same thing that have already been answered!

If that's still too much for you to handle, here's a helpful FAQ!!!!

""What are some tips for a new streamer?"": You need a schedule (stay consistent), have some energy,  bring something to the table other streamers dont, and have fun with whatever you're doing. Ask yourself ""Why should anyone watch me over Lirik?"". 

""How can I get viewers?"": Networking, Youtube, Luck, Twitter, and Reddit are all good ways to get viewers.

""What do I talk about with no viewers?"": ANYTHING! It can be pretty much anything. It can be your day, music, a video you watched, or the game you're playing. In my short experience with streaming the viewers are there to see YOU, not the game. You're probably not good enough to attract viewers for your gameplay anyway. (Unless you are, congratulations on being good by the way!)

Basically, search before you post guys. Here are a couple guides to give you advice if you didn't read this entire rant.

3s4855,"I realized what I was doing, decided to unfollow streamers so I could stop lying to myself. I hope people will do the same","**I'm not looking for karma or anything, I'm a near full time lurker and intend to stay that way (hence this new account). I also don't intend to hate on any streamers with this post**


I'm a lonely young adult male, and I'm 100% sure I'm not the only one on twitch. Sometimes watching certain streams have been helpful to making me feel... not so lonely. 


That being said, a companion of the opposite sex is obviously appealing to a lonely bastard like me, so in time I began watching girl streams, not for their gameplay skill, or their personality. 


I ended up watching them because 1. they looked good, and 2. I felt that watching their steams made me more than who I was, even when most of the times it wasn't true.


After reading a fictional story about modern day bullying and social media, I found myself frighteningly similar to one of the bullied characters in the story.


Before I realized it, I had followed over 10-15 girl streamers just to trick myself into thinking I had company, I struggled and vied for their attention amongs hundreds to sometimes thousands of other faceless users as they spammed Kappa and memes.


Every time a donation came through a cute noise/image pops up and: ""thank yoouuu love youuu"" *puts on a cute face for face cam* 


or 


""Welcome to the familyyy"" or ""welcome to the cluuub"" or ""new husband!"" /cringe


Then after the donation or sub, the donator/sub would fade from their memory. Back into the faceless masses vying for attention


**Of course this isn't true for all the girl gamers** but it was the case for at least 90% of the ones I followed.


**I wasn't actually a part of their life, at least not in a meaningful way, and they weren't truly here for me either**


**I've been forgetting my real friends, or the quality streams that displayed good mechanical skill in the games I wanted to improve in.** 


**And I realized how disgusting I became,** how I've been tricking myself into following these streamers who didn't truly care about me or spending time with me. 


So I unfollowed all the streams that I originally followed for the false company. 


Out of the 15+ girl gamers I think I'm left with 2 or 3, who actually displayed good skill in their game or actually spent quality time getting to know her audience and played with them in game. And even then I'm iffy about my reasons for staying for 1 of them, **but I'm confident that I've improved myself for the better.**


**I know this is rambling and I hope I didn't offend the girl streamers with genuinely good intentions for streaming, but I felt that this had to be said.**


**I hope people who were like me read this so they can work up the courage to tear off their rose coloured glasses and stop lying to themselves.**


**Your real friends are waiting,** and even if you are in a shitty position and have no real friends (I'm sorry), **there are other streams that give quality gameplay or have streamers who will actually acknowledge you. So stop lying to yourself with this illusion of company and maybe you can go meet some real genuine friends**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3s4855/i_realized_what_i_was_doing_decided_to_unfollow/,1447063199.0,51,0.69,57,Twitch,NewStepsNewlife

3r98rn,Being a girl on Twitch,"I'll probably get downvoted for this just because I am stating my gender and what I'm about type.  I just wanted to share my experience on two different ways I approached Twitch.  When I first started streaming, I kind of had a ""manager.""  I put that in quotations because he was actually a friend who tried to benefit off of me.  He found out that I wanted to start streaming and decided to ""guide me"" in the direction that would bring me in tons of donations, as long as I gave him a percentage.  I didn't really care about the money, so I went along with it.  

Obviously, one of the first things he told me to do was show skin. Every time I streamed, I would wear a tank top.  The second thing he told me to do was be cute, not just in personality but in my profiles too.  Third thing he advised me to do, was to kiss ass. Not literally of course, but he told me to sweet talk any guy who came into the chat, and if we played a game together, to overcompliment him on his plays (no matter how bad he was) and make him feel manly. 

There were other things he told me to do, and in the first two months, I made over $500.00 just from donations using his method, and gained over a thousand followers, and had almost 50 viewers concurrently.  

To be honest, I wasn't happy.  I felt fake. I know this sounds like total BS, but it just felt gross.  I only did it because he promised me I would get viewers/followers fast with his method, and it's true.  However, it just all felt wrong.

Last month, I decided to tell my friend I didn't want to use his method anymore.  He was a bit mad since he was getting a percentage of my donations, but said since it was my stream, I could do whatever I wanted.

I started wearing T-shirts.  It felt ALOT more comfortable.  I stopped wearing makeup and just started being myself. I stopped kissing ass, and just treated everyone fairly. And let's be honest, I lost a lot of viewers when I did this.  I went from 50 daily down to about 20ish nowadays, and I'm not even sad.  It just felt so stressful to put on that type of persona of trying to be sexy the entire stream, and having trolls come in everytime I turned on my channel.  These days, I barely have trolls, and I got to see who my real loyal viewers were, and who only came for the skin.  I also haven't received a donation that was more than $5.00 in over a month, lol, which is fine, because I started out streaming for fun and not money.  

Not sure why I typed all this up for Reddit, but it's just something I went through. I just feel more real now, and my channel feels more genuine. It was really tiring trying to be someone I wasn't. And, I guess it's true, being girl on Twitch is easier if you know what you're doing. I'm not gonna lie and be like, ""Gender doesn't matter,"" because after going through all that, being a girl does have its advantages.

I also recently started streaming on another Twitch account when I didn't want to go on my main Twitch account.  It would be with no camera but only mic.  I literally had no viewers for the first two weeks, and still don't have viewers to this day, rofl.  Yeah, people would stop by, but no one really would talk or follow. xD

EDIT: I'm at work and secretly typing this, LOL!  There were a lot of details I left out on how he taught me to gain followers/viewers/donations, but I just don't have time to type it all up.  This was pretty rushed, but I just really felt like sharing this with you all, even though I'll probably get hate, lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3r98rn/being_a_girl_on_twitch/,1446496082.0,151,0.77,102,Twitch,Euryale11

Viewbotting services are so sophisticated they include fake chatters, phrase lists, game theme chatters and other features.

The simple fact that twitch can not determine who is doing the viewbotting made this inevitable that it will go mainstream to this extent.

Coupled with loyalty bot and rewards, people are able to offset botted viewers with real people sitting in channels for loyalty points.

Twitch Staff has noted multiple times they have metrics and data to know what channels are being botted.  Twitch needs to adopt shadow banning like what happens on reddit, so whenever they see a trend of a stream being botted its removed from the directory &amp; game lists.

* Viewbotting goal is to gain rank position in the directory and game list (to get seen in the sea of channels) , take this away, and viewbotting will be a waste.

3ps7bj,Things I've noticed since I stopped using a face cam as a female streamer.,"Sorry for any typos or run on sentences.. I wrote this up pretty fast while on break at work. Cheers!


EDIT1: I thought I'd add here that I do not wear anything revealing. I'm all Logo T-Shirts and jeans here. You're lucky if you can see my collar bone. :)

EDIT2: I am not bothered by trolls. I kill them with kindness. I don't see the point in getting upset over strangers who came to try and ruin my day. :)

Hello, Everyone! I know there's a lot of debate about using a webcam helps your stream grow. Also, there are debates about female streamers being more popular and being able to grow faster. I've been streaming for about four months now and recently decided to get rid of my webcam on stream because I felt it took away from the game being played. I decided I'd like to share my personal experiences between having a cam and not having a cam on stream.

Let me start off by saying I'm a 26 year old female. I started streaming on 7/2/15. Some of my viewers suggest I use my cam and I decided ""Sure, why not?"". I noticed I instantly got a spike in follows when I did. I also got a boost of about 5-10 more viewers on top of my current 5 viewers. I've been stuck at around 10 viewers on average except for when raids and hosts occur. I was getting around 10-40 followers a day. These are all the good things that increased.. Unfortunately the amount of trolls increased too. I went through DDoS attacks, basic trollings, the works. They would always come back. My viewers would still stay around the 10 viewer mark.. and I'd still be gaining just as many follows. Something didn't add up here. I figured it was just the norm on twitch to face all the negativity from trolls and brushed it off. But I couldn't understand how I was gaining so many followers and not raising my view count. As of right now I am almost at 600 followers. I think about only 50 of those users actually came back and support the stream.

Fast forward 3 months and I take away my webcam because I don't feel up to it one day. I noticed the follows dwindled to 1 or 2 followers but my views stayed the same. However, all the trolls had disappeared. New viewers who showed up were there for the game. They actually came back for the next few streams when the followed. So i continued without the webcam. Its been 2 weeks and now the past few days I've been hitting 20 viewers, no trolls, and people genuinely interested in the game instead of my gender. I have to say I feel the new followers I have are amazing and kind. It is such a relief to be able to stream and not have to babysit your chat for trolls. It's also nice to know people are there for the game and not my looks. I don't think I'm much to look at, but I'm sure there are people out there who have been to my stream because of the face cam alone. 

TL;DR: No Face Cam resulted in more Genuine viewers, less trolls, and an amazing stream experience.

3ph9k4,Problem: XSolla,"**German** video explaining the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4wc8ungxI  

**English**  
Basically, the problem this streamer is talking about is that the Xsolla company have some kind of agreement or whatever you wanna call it with the EU that they have to pay additional fees to the EU (correct me if i'm wrong) which resulted in EU citizens having to pay ~$6 instead of $4,99 like everyone outside the EU. Now, as Xsolla offers additional payment methods like Paysafecard, Mobile payment etc. it makes sense. **However**, even if you pay through Paypal via Xsolla, you have to pay the additional fees. If you turn off the additional payment methods on your dashboard however and then pay with Paypal, you **do not** have to pay the additional fees anymore. This is simply unacceptable and I am pretty sure a lot of streamers don't even know about this problem.  

Staiy (the streamer in the video) also mentioned that the fees they have to pay to Xsolla are too big for any streamer that isnt HUGE for the additional payment methods to be worth enabling. All in all, most subscriptions probably come through paypal and thus not making it worth it to enable Xsolla.  
Another big problem is that Twitch did not inform either the Partners or the Viewers about this at any point.  

Please spread this problem to any streamers you might know and be aware of the fact that the additional fees are **not unavoidable**.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3ph9k4/problem_xsolla/,1445341024.0,61,0.93,40,Twitch,Veineless
3p5doq,Beginner's Guide to Streaming,"Hey /r/Twitch! *Thank you /u/zhaoshike for the gold. This community is amazing &lt;3*

&amp;nbsp;

*Good to be back with another guide for you. If you're not familiar with my Guides, feel free to check them out listed at the bottom of the post!*

&amp;nbsp;

**Who am I?**

My name is [Foti](http://www.twitchdb.tv/profile/u/fotigames), I run a fulltime partnered cast on twitch. Been doing it for long enough now that I feel like I can give back to the community with some of the stuff I've learned! Ultimately I want to improve twitch altogether, and that simply *can't* be done if I only worry about myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

This Guide is specifically targeted at the newer / prospective streamers on Twitch. It's going to have lots of information that you may or may not know a few months into streaming, and lots of info about things *I wish I knew* back when I first started. 

&amp;nbsp;

    If this sounds like what you're looking for, then let's get right into it:

&amp;nbsp;

**Where should you start?**

Anywhere really. Where I recommend is with your username. Can't rightly stream without an account on twitch, can you?

   &gt; More importantly, the correct username. I can't tell you how often I wish I changed my name to something more clever. I'm sitting here with ""Games"" at the end of my last name, meanwhile friends of mine are running around with names like AlaskanSavage, TigerWriter and TheHunterWild. 

Pick your name carefully. Avoid cliches like numbers at the end of your name, Xs, Games, TV, etc. 

   &gt; Your name will follow you around for as long as you're on twitch. If you've been a viewer for a long time but want to get into streaming, or you've just recently started with little to no following, then create a new name!

&amp;nbsp;

**Hardware, Software &amp; Visuals**

This is a big one and a frequently overlooked topic to discuss. Most people assume the strategy ""if you want to *be* the best, be *like* the best,"" which is a valid strategy. When it comes to equipment (PC, Capture card, greenscreen, etc) however, it is something best done minimalistically.

   &gt;This will all be covered later in the guide, in the meantime just keep the word ""minimal"" in mind.

&amp;nbsp;

**Find out if you *like* streaming in the first place.**

When you first start streaming, you're not experienced enough to know if you like it or not. You may go into it thinking it's gonna be unicorns and rainbows, then after your first stream realize you'd rather eat a bowl of nails than go live again. It's a really different world when you're live than anything else you've probably come across in your life.

   &gt; Take some time to learn the basics of your dashboard *[twitch.tv/&lt;username&gt;/dashboard]* and get your browsers outfitted with the Better Twitch TV addon (an incredibly useful tool that I'll never go without).

&amp;nbsp;

**Decide on Software:**

Since you're still testing things out, I recommend Open Broadcaster Software (commonly referred to as OBS). It's completely free and is an industry standard. This is the software you'll be using to turn your webcam, gameplay and voice into a stream (and send it to twitch servers).

   &gt; The software I use is called XSplit. It's a paid alternative (monthly) that has a few extra bells and whistles. I don't recommend going near it until you've gotten enough experience to make the call of switching between them. It has it's own bugs to be worked out still.

Set up your first few scenes &amp; stream settings in the software, there are plenty of tutorials on youtube how to do that all properly and fit it to your bandwidth.

When you start, you'll really only need 2 scenes: Talk Scene, and Gameplay Scene. One is for when you're starting or ending the stream and you're talking to your viewers, and the other is -you guessed it- for when you're playing your games.

   &gt; I encourage you to use google to learn how to set up scenes and add sources, it will teach you a lot better if you seek the information out than if I were to write it all here.

&amp;nbsp;

**Notifications**

When someone follows, donates or hosts, generally they want on screen recognition of that. I highly advise looking into getting those set up on your stream.

One of the leading sources for that right now is TwitchAlerts. If you go to their site they even have tutorials and customer support to help you get it all set up. You'll want to set up Followers, Donations and Hosts (last one optional).

&amp;nbsp;

**Channel Information**

Below your video player on desktop, there is a space for your stream information. Commonly called your Panels. Create a separate panel for different bits of information; Who are you? What is your schedule? What is your social Media? What is your channel about? What stream teams are you in? 

   &gt; If you're any good at photoshop, then design some graphics for the panels, and if people click on the image you can have it direct them to a link somewhere.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lighting &amp; Production Equipment**

When you're starting out, you only need a desk lamp. Shine it at your face. Did you do that? Good. That's all you needed to do. Microphone? a Blue Yeti is a great way to get into it, but a gaming headset can work too.

   &gt; Do not, I repeat *do not* go and buy a greenscreen, studio lights, a super expensive camera, or a dual stream PC yet. Those are considered the ""meta"" of streaming, but are really unnecessary in the beginning stages of streaming. There will come a time when you are ready to upgrade these things, and you'll know when that is. Start small, keep it simple.

&amp;nbsp;

**Theme**

Now that you've got the ship, time to decide on the destination. What kind of games are you going to play? Are you going to full time one game (only play one game)? Or will you be doing a variety? What about both?

   &gt; These are all questions you need to ask yourself before you start. Pick a game, go with it. If you don't like that game or it doesn't mesh well with your entertainment personality, try a different one. 

It's all about having fun. If you're not having fun, nobody will have fun watching you. So play the games you want to play.

- A little secret is the popularity of the games you play. When you look at the game list on twitch, scroll allll the way down until you find the games with 25- 99 viewers total. Those are the best games for you to get started on, because your channel will be more visible (closer to the #1 top streamer in the game). If you play a game with thousands of other people playing it, you'll be so far down on the list that you'll be virtually invisible. 

&gt; ""Avoid the hype train at all possible costs."" - LolRenaynay, Fulltime Twitch Partnered Broadcaster

The above quote rings true on many levels. There will be many games that come out while you're streaming. Try to minimize the amount of those you actually play at launch. There are streamers out there who pull between 5,000 to 45,000 viewers who almost *exclusively* only play those new releases or *""flavor of the month""* games. You'll be even further down on the list than if you played Minecraft or League of Legends.

&gt; Of course if you wanted to play it regardless and entertain the people that you have already, and not worry so much about growth for that game, then do it. I'll be getting on Fallout 4 day 1 no matter what my numbers look like. Because it's what I want, and what the viewers want.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mods + Helpers**

If you've made any friends on twitch before you started streaming, ask them to help mod for you in the beginning. If not, then ask some of your irl friends to give you a hand. They can keep you company while you're trying to get your first organic viewers, and can help keep you sane through the quiet hours while you're talking to yourself.

I advise also getting the app called ""Discord."" It's very useful for communicating with your mods - it's across every platform and device and even has voice and system wide push to talk. Get your mods in there and have them talk amongst one another.

   &gt; Mods are people assigned by the *broadcaster* of the channel (that's you) to help administrate the stream while the broadcaster is doing their job. To give someone mod, type */mod &lt;username&gt;* in your chat. To unmod them, it's */unmod*

&amp;nbsp;

**Alternative Streaming Routes**

Some of us can't afford a PC to stream from or a capture card for console gameplay. A good way to get started in streaming is using the Twitch Apps on the PS4 or the Xbox One to get your feet wet. 

I know a few people who have actually built *successful* streams around console streaming apps, and only just recently switched to PC with a capture card. They are totally feasable options.

   &gt; Not to mention, all of your friends on the console will be able to see your stream from their dashboards, and you can advertise it through messages (politely, see my Networking Etiquette guide for more info)

&amp;nbsp;

**Just keep talking and nobody explodes!**

The most important thing to remember is you have to keep talking! Every minute you're silent is a minute someone could have come in, and left because they were bored. Just because nobody is chatting doesn't mean nobody is watching.

   &gt; It's a common practice to not look at the ""numbers,"" or the view count of your stream while live. Cover up any of that info so you don't see it, and try not to peek.
When someone does say hi to you, make sure you respond. Viewers love an interactive chat (That is, if you plan on having an interactive stream. Some people treat it differently).

&amp;nbsp;

**Set a schedule and don't push yourself.**

- ""When's game of thrones gonna be on this weekend?"" - Ron

- ""Oh I don't know, they played it at 5pm last week, and Noon the week before."" - Harry

See where I'm going with this? If viewers don't know when you'll be live, then how can you expect them to find your show again?

   &gt; Also, don't push yourself past your limits. In the beginning, it's perfectly normal to only be able to stream for an hour or so. But the ""norm"" or status quotient is between 6 to 8 hours. Work your way up there.

&amp;nbsp;

**Social Media**

""But James, I don't *like* twitter! That shit is for the birds."" 

Well that's too bad, because you need it to survive on Twitch. It's how all of us streamers talk to one another, how we network, and how we communicate with fans. So get into the habit of using it, and don't forget to look up good tags to use with your tweets.

As for other social media, use it as you will. All of it can help spread the word about your work, but twitter is the only ""necessity.""

   &gt; There's a setting on Twitch that allows you to auto-tweet when you go live. Turn that off, and write the tweets yourself including the link. Observe proper grammar and spelling, and it'll make a tweet that is much more personal and interactive.

The tags are important! Hashtag the shit out of it at first (to a classy level). It's the only way your tweets are going to get exposure at first. Eventually, you'll be able to get your viewers to help retweet and favorite your tweets, which also helps.

   &gt;Any activity on a tweet bumps it's ranking up in any of the tags that you placed in the tweet. The more favs and retweets, the higher on the list it will show.

&amp;nbsp;

**Upgrading and improving your stream**

While it's okay to start out at potato quality, I highly recommend upgrading things as you go on. Slowly.

The way I did it is change or improve one thing about your stream every day after you go offline. If it were changing a notification sound, adding a new command, sending a message to a viewer, or anything really. That will get you in the mindset to keep your channel in a constant state of motion.

Once your attentions start turning towards improving the quality of your cast, then you should start upgrading things. Provided you have the budget. Replace one piece of hardware at a time as you see fit, and make sure you learn about what you're buying and how to use it.

   &gt; A big problem I see is people buying a shit load of the latest gear, dual PC's etc, and not know how to use it. I have all these things because I slowly taught myself each and every item until I understood it, then I got the upgrades. And, let me tell you, dual PC setups are a hell of a lot more of a headache than I was willing to admit at first.

&amp;nbsp;

**Anything else I should keep in mind?**

- Streaming isn't easy. You'll lose a lot of sleep, it's a lot of work, 95% technical difficulties, demoralizing and the best thing to ever happen to my life. That should explain the kind of experience you'll probably have as a streamer.

- If you like it, keep it up. Improve yourself, take inspiration from outside sources. Watch other streams, ask questions, learn how to make your stuff better. The more you're into it yourself, the more your viewers will be into you.

- Activate your past broadcasts in your account settings, and watch them every once in a while! I recommend at least once a week, look at the previous week's past broadcast. Find things you didn't like, and things you liked, even things you liked that could be improved upon. Keep those things in the back of your mind as you cast, and try to improve them. Once the next week rolls around, repeat the process! After a while, you'll be well on your way to a great cast.

&amp;nbsp;

I can guarantee I will be adding more to this as we all contribute to the guide. This is a basic starters guide for the new-to-streaming. Thank you all so much for reading and I hope you learned something new!

**UPDATE** : 

A series of  questions(from purplekoolaidguy) answered: 

------
* **How long after the hijack did the issue occur?:** 

 &gt; * I started the exe file and it asked me to extract some files. 
&gt; * As soon as it did Steam closed down and restarted in login screen the screen was black at first for 30 sec. 
&gt; * After a while it it turned normal and I was unable to login
&gt; * I checked my email and the email reported a intrusion from a different computer.
&gt; * In the email there was a mail from steam for a security code I didnt ask for. 
&gt; * I tried to login to steam again and checked forgot password but the email had already been changed. 

 &gt; Everything took about 5 min.

* **Did the user download anything else prior to the hijak in the last week?**

 &gt; * I havent downloaded anything prior to this. 

* **Has the user had issue with viruses on his PC in the past or recently?**

 &gt; * No, I keep checking viruses regularly. 

* **Did you download the file from the youtube link?** 

 &gt; * Yes, I did. 

**Information from OBS forums :** 

&gt; OBS plugins are always .DLL files and no direct executables.

&gt;Beside that, the claims are not valid since transcoding is down on twitch-side and there is nothing you can do as a user (beside getting partnered), so it's very likely scam. The password on the zip is also there to keep anti-virus software out of the zip.

&gt;The ""HLS""-Settings on the Twitch page are also not there and most likely injected by the software or just faked.

3om1y2,Understanding Branding and How Broadcasters are Doing It,"Branding is a marketing term that you should know if you're involved with creating a product or offering a service. It is relevant to anyone who streams on Twitch as they are creating a unique blend of product and service: streaming video that is shaped by a live audience. I've seen a few very good comments on the subreddit that talk about aspects of  branding, but I'm hoping to offer a comprehensive look at what branding is and why you should care about it. This is a long post, so read at your own peril.

&amp;nbsp;

**Defining Branding**

Branding is an amorphous concept. Here's the best explanation I've found:

&gt;&gt;Simply put, your brand is your promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from that of your competitors. Your brand is derived from who you are, who you want to be and who people perceive you to be.

As a streamer, your brand is part of your identity. It ties into all the things you say and do, your overlays, your appearance, your stream graphics and buttons, your activity on social media and anything else you can think of. It forms a part of the way new viewers judge you and others on Twitch instinctively react and think about you.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Power of Branding**

For an example that most people can relate to, let's talk about syrupy sugar water. Suppose that I take my old family recipe for a decent tasting carbonated caramel-colored beverage, put it in a can with the name ""Good Cola"" and get it on supermarket shelves for the same price as similar sodas.  A consumer walks into the store, looks at the can of Good Cola and the adjacent can of Coca-Cola. Good Cola gets a half a second of thought. It sounds like it might be pretty good cola.

The can of Coca-Cola triggers a cascade of thoughts and reactions. The can has a high quality design and a logo that they've seen since childhood. Just seeing that blend of red and white keys off thoughts of drinking Coke. The product has been around for nearly 130 years and has become ingrained in our society. Their favorite restaurant only serves Coke brand soft drinks. The cups at their local movie theater have the logo on them. They recall the advertisements they saw as a kid, a mother polar bear and her cub being adorable and relaxing with a cool bottle of Coke. They associate Coca-Cola with all of their favorite sporting events and leagues (which Coke has conveniently sponsored). They remember that the only soda their parents ever drink is Coca-Cola. They've had Coke dozens of times in their life and it always had that same refreshing taste. So... they buy the can of Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola is considered one of the strongest brands in the world and for many people, it is THE cola beverage. It doesn't mean you can't compete with it. But simply offering another high quality product isn't enough. You need to make yourself stand out. Without something to make that can of Good Cola a unique product in a consumer's mind, they will always go with the established product. That's where branding comes in.

**Two Successful Brands on Twitch**

Creating a successful brand involves understanding what you uniquely offer and anchoring your name/image to a certain perception in the minds of others. Branding involves the same process on Twitch, though a huge portion of the work is tied to how you produce your content. 

You can stand out using personal appearance, voice work, physical behavior/performance, attitude on stream, your reactions to emotion, or the graphics and appearance of your stream. If you're doing it well, you're taking most of these elements and weaving them together to build up the image that people will associate with your content. You want to find a way you wish to be perceived and get people to view you that way.

I could try to set out general guidelines for how to do this, but the process of creating a brand identity really ties into everything you do on your broadcast. I think we benefit more from seeing examples in action, so I will direct your attention to two streamers with excellent branding on Twitch: [Lethalfrag](http://www.twitch.tv/lethalfrag) and [FuturemanGaming](http://www.twitch.tv/futuremangaming). I'll speak about each of them, but I urge you to watch both broadcasters. Note that you don't need to do nearly this much to have a solid and recognizable brand on Twitch, but you can see the benefits of both styles at work.

&amp;nbsp;

**1)** [Lethalfrag](http://www.twitch.tv/lethalfrag) is an amazing example of a broadcaster that has a well-established and recognizable brand without being over the top. Many examples of solid branding on Twitch involve crazy gimmicks or wacky behavior. But branding comes in many forms. The auto repair shop in your home town that gets work done quickly, correctly, and at reasonable costs is engaging in branding. Their image is one of reliability and dependability. It generates business and often times a lot of it. 

Frag's broadcast is in this exact vein. His rise to popularity in the variety broadcasting community was tied to a combination of excellent timing/game choice and his two year livestream challenge. Every day for two years straight, he was producing live content. His style involves laid back behavior, heavy chat interaction, and focus on creating and maintaining a positive community.

In terms of personal appearance, Frag anchored his image off of his beard and hair, which he didn't cut over the course of his live stream challenge. It's only been in the past few months, after his stream was WELL established that he really made a major change to to his physical appearance. 

Many behaviors and reactions are nearly ritualized on his broadcast. Completing a run of Isaac has its own ceremony. Key phrases and remarks are common and predictable. The stream has regular topics of discussion that are touched on multiple times each broadcast. While some of these things change over time, they provide recognizable continuity for regular viewers  and an experience that new viewers can be inducted into.

Frag engages in a good deal of behavior that promotes a desired image for his stream and himself. He uses positive reinforcement, constantly complimenting his audience and thanking them for good behavior and their patronage of his broadcast. Whenever Frag refers to his time with broadcasting, he emphasizes his view that his work is part of his career and his desire to keep his work fun but professional. He's quick to point out his adherence to his schedule. Additionally, he appeals to his audience emotionally with regular updates on his concerns about his stream and the community built around it. All of this is active image building that helps shape the way LethalFrag and his content are viewed.

&amp;nbsp;

**2)**[FuturemanGaming](http://www.twitch.tv/futuremangaming) is over the top fun. Crazy gimmicks AND wacky behavior are at the heart of his show. To anyone who wasn't aware, Futureman at one point had a channel on Twitch under a different name. That original show was much more mundane and likewise much less successful. The new channel and associated Futureman persona are a testament to the power of good branding to create an image and expectation for viewers. His rise to popularity are tied to the high quality of branding done on his channel and some strong exposure thanks to Twitch’s Partner Spotlight.

Sentient video games, time travel, and an incredibly stretched N.E.R.F. acronym are just the start of the backstory that introduces Futureman to new viewers. He's a slim man in a ridiculous tracksuit with a futuristic vizor. You've got liberal use of a voice transformer. Oh and don't forget his [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVdAAnb01X8&amp;feature=youtu.be).

Every one of his shows is framed by an over-the-top opening/closing and take place from his Future Ship. Most broadcasts are simply high quality let’s plays, transformed by his in-character behavior, interesting stream overlays, and some common memes for viewers to rally around. Some content, like DJs in Space, is just completely innovative and a draw in itself. In both cases, it's clear that Futureman is creating something incredibly unique.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Request**

One of the best ways to understand branding and improve your own is to actively understand how it is being done. I’ve tried to give two pretty detailed examples of what broadcasters are doing to brand their content, but more is always better. If you’re up to it, look at your own channel or another broadcaster that you enjoy and figure out how they are building their own brand. Post a few sentences or paragraphs detailing how that branding works in the comments below. More examples are always useful for people taking their first steps in branding their own channels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3om1y2/understanding_branding_and_how_broadcasters_are/,1444758201.0,52,0.9,37,Twitch,sadpandadag

I was checking out a flight simulator center and was taking a tour with one of the trainers. We were talking about flight simming and I discussed that I streamed it. He said he has watched streams before and asked my twitch name. I told him my twitch, and he said he watches my streams! How cool is that! I met someone who watches my streams, by accident. For myself, as a small streamer, this is so cool!

3ocesf,We bring you emotes!,"For those of you who have been around on /r/Twitch for quite a while, you may remember that we used to have emotes. However, Reddit limits the size of our custom CSS and the images that are included in it. But, thanks to latest optimizations, we can allow you to use 24 Twitch emotes on this sub!  
  
The current emotes available are listed below this text, along with the markdown code you need to copy-paste to make it appear. Please note that all emotes are /r/Twitch specific and will not work on other Subs and in areas where CSS doesn't apply (such as messages in your inbox from /r/Twitch).  
  
If you would like to see any other emotes, make sure to leave them in the comments. We *may* be able to include them if we ever decide to change the emote spritesheets and CSS.

3nqlfb,How to Use Twitter EFFECTIVELY in Growing Your Broadcast,"If you ask around for advice on growing as a smaller streamer here on the subreddit, someone will inevitably point you towards using social media. They're entirely correct: social media allows broadcasters to expand their reach and interact with viewers outside of the broadcast. But usually the discussion ends there, leaving out the ""how"" entirely. Just like any other equipment or tools you use while streaming, it takes experience and effort to learn how to get the most out of each form of social media.

I won't pretend to be an absolute expert on the issue, but Twitter definitely plays a role in the promotion of our broadcast. What I can offer are some general tips that have been personally useful as well as techniques other broadcasters commonly use to increase awareness about of their channels:

* Create and maintain a twitter account that represents your broadcast. Your profile should reflect all the relevant information the uninitiated might need to find your broadcast. Most of your posts should relate to your gaming and networking efforts. Don't be afraid to inject some personality, but always remember the focus is improving your brand.

* Direct your viewers to your Twitter account. If you want active twitter participation from your audience, you need to actively encourage it. [Create an on stream pop up with your twitter information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2so6ud/animated_panels_using_htmlcss_with_clr_browser/). Directly ask viewers to follow your Twitter account before you go on breaks. [Create an automated CTT message for your chat](https://clicktotweet.com/basic). Thank individual viewers that Tweet about your stream. [Create a twitter widget to display your retweets](https://twitter.com/settings/widgets), capture it with CLR Browser, and display your retweets on broadcast/during breaks.

* Make good use of hashtags and tweet at the appropriate people. If you're playing a game, figure out any appropriate hashtags related to the game and find the developer's twitter. Tweet out with this information before you start a game and send updates with your thoughts as you play the game. For popular games, you're tapping into a potentially huge audience. For smaller games, you have a chance to get the attention of the developers directly. Everyone wants to encourage excitement about their game, and most developers/promoters will be more than happy when you bring yourself to their attention.

* Use Twitter to keep your audience up to date on your broadcast. Tweet your broadcast before you go live. In streams that go more than a few hours or where you plan on switching games partway through, tweet out updates. [Schedule automated update tweets](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) if you don't plan on doing this mid-broadcast.

* Continue the conversation. Remember that your Twitter account is an extension of your broadcast. Give your thoughts about the games you are playing and have played. Reply to what other people playing that game are tweeting about. Ask your twitter audience questions and encourage them to share their opinions. This is your chance to tap into pre-existing communities on Twitter and to strengthen yours at the same time.

* Use twitter as a general networking tool. As you discover other broadcasters that you enjoy, proactively tweet at them and retweet/favorite their content. Unless you're talking to someone ridiculously famous, they *will* take notice of the people who regularly interact with them. Don't attempt to measure the impact and don't be upset if nothing comes of it. At worst, you're helping out someone whose content you enjoy. And at best... well, that's the way several of our friendships on Twitch began.

I could go on longer and I encourage you to research the topic of Twitter promotion on your own. There are nearly endless resources out there on the subject and this doesn't even touch on the ways of analyzing the effectiveness of your Twitter efforts. Still, these are a few good starting points for a new broadcaster looking to add Twitter to their collection of promotional tools.

Edit: I just wanted to add that there are a lot of valuable comments that have followed from this. Major topics that are worth examining include: the value of including personality in your Twitter, understanding when your posts feel spammy, the mess that is follows for follows, the awkwardness of auto messaging, and more.

3n5m0v,Buffering &amp; Stream Lag issues: The Megathread.,"We have decided to create a megathread on buffering issues, as lots of people are having issues with buffering and it is becoming diffuclt to collect all the information. Below, some steps will be listed on potential solutions, as well as information on how you can better report such issues.

This thread may be edited from time to time as new info is added, so check back reguaraly if your issue remains to be unresolved.

----

Buffering issues in general are fairly hard to troubleshoot not-real time due to the number of factors affecting it, including some dynamic factors such as link load, server status, concurrent users, time of day, etc.

The *best* way to be able to look into issues is for you to click the gear icon in the bottom right, selecting your issue and clicking ""submit""

----

There are some things you can try if you are getting buffering:

- Verify your flash version is up to to date - http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html

- Make sure you test in incognito mode. This ensures no extensions are making it run slowly.

- Check other streams for buffering. If it's only a few streams, it's likely a throughput deficiency.

- Disable anti-virus software such as Avast temporarily (Avast is known to hinder video delivery)

----

If you'd like to give Twitch Staff some additional debug info, please go to a live stream and press f12. 

Navigate to the ""network"" tab and then find which video server you are getting data from. (should look like video12.sfo01.hls.twitch.tv) as well as your IP from whatsmyip.org &amp; fill out this forum: http://link.twitch.tv/buffering_information_form

**DO NOT POST YOUR IP IN THIS THREAD.**

----

If the steps listed above aren't enough, please comment below and state how long the issue has been going on, and if its been happening with the new html5 controls player!

Additionally, if you have any fixes that you would like to see listed in this post, comment and let me know, I will be happy to add it.

3mzemr,Streams without quality options buffering like mad,"I have been having this problem for about a week now. Most of the streams with no quality options on them will gradually decreasing buffer sizes, and then buffering for about 5-10s and then displaying the stream for another few seconds before buffering again. 

Once the delay actually gets high enough (around 70-90s) because of the constant buffering, the stream just outright freezes. I have a 100/10 Mbit/s down/up connection. I have contacted twitch support and filled a form about the buffering. On top of that I have tried the following things to try to fix it:

* Reinstalled and updated flash
* Tried streams on Chrome, Firefox and IE (all up to date)
* Tried installing BTTV addon for chrome
* Tried using Livestreamer and LivestreamerGUI
* Tried without any Chrome addons on and while in incognito
* Tried ipconfig /flushdns
* Tried to use Google DNS Servers and OpenDNS Servers
* Configured the Flash Player to have Unlimited local storage
* Asked one streamer to lower his bitrate for testing, he halved it but no effect on me whatsoever

Does anyone have ANY idea on what I could actually do to solve this? I am running out of options and I have no idea what is causing this problem.

- PlayStation Apps: *The full Twitch experience will soon be coming to the PSVita, PS3 and PS4.*
- VoD Playlists: *It will soon be possible to create playlists from VoDs and Highlights that can play while you are offline and not hosting anybody.*
- Whispers 2.0: *Whispers will now be shown in a separate window, rather than making it in chat. Conversations will now be saved and shown the next time you log on Twitch. As last time, they will be shown across the site. These features will also be available in the mobile app. The idea behind this is to make whisper more accessible!*
- Improved Search: *This is a little self-explanatory, but searches will soon be more relevant!*
- HTML5 Player: *Goodbye Flash! Some of you may already have the HTML5 controls, but the whole player will soon run in HTML. This means that streams will be much smoother and buffer less.*
- VoD Thumbnails: *The long requested feature is finally here! There will be 4 preset choices from the VoD and it will then be possible to upload a custom one from your device too.*
- Video Uploads: *Youtube challenges Twitch and Twitch fights back. It will soon be possible to upload videos to your channel that have not been streamed. This can allow for edited content to be uploaded.*

Shortly after that we Skyped together, and a year and a half later I left New Zealand and came to America so we could finally meet in real life.  

As of yesterday I've been in America for just over 3 months and am now the proud husband to Froggie717, a woman I met on Twitch and the love of my life :)  

I thought I might share this story to brighten up some of your days and perhaps hear about people you've met on Twitch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3lkd9a/i_just_got_married_and_i_met_my_wife_on_twitch/,1442676240.0,159,0.9,60,Twitch,UltimaN3rd
3leo7f,Full Guide for Stream Beginners!,"Hey Everyone,

I decided to provide a fairly comprehensive guide for those who are interested in streaming, and how to start!

It'll cover a large variety of topics, with a lot of suggestions based on my observations and advice I've been provided by streamers. It is for anyone who plans to use OBS, Xsplit is a different beast and I am unfamiliar with it. So before we begin, buckle up, put on your helmet, and get your travel mug cause we're going for a rip! 

###Creating Your Channel

1. **Coming Up With A Name:** Like any product, you want something that is catchy, simple, and memorable. Also, for those who really want to roll with it, you can have a theme! Your name is important because it really sets you up for having solid branding for your channel. Some people just make a channel, and their username is something unoriginal or unattractive ""Jdawg2245"" or ""JackDavies"" or something along those lines. You are trying to diversify yourself in this highly competitive market, so give thought to your channel name because it sets the stage for a lot of future decisions. 

2. **Catch Phrases**: It may sound silly, but catch phrases are a big deal in this industry. They create branding, and they create a sense of familiarity for fans/viewers to recognize a channel. CohhCarnage for example has his ""Good Show!!"" when he receives a sub, or for Ezekiel_III, he not only has a whole spiel, he also has a thing he does that is a unique fist bump for when he gets a new sub. For myself, when someone followers, I say ""Welcome to the Moose Squad"". I'm Canadian, so I felt utilizing that helped play on my nationality, but also was interesting because ... well Moose are pretty badass! The Moose also opens up a lot of branding opportunities. Coming up with your own catch phrase will make people get excited in your channel, they will look forward to your catch phrase, and hell, they'll say it themselves when talking with fellow viewers!

3. **Schedule**: Before you stream, know when you plan to stream. This is important in order to provide a concrete, cut and dry, timeline of when you'll be online. This is important for viewer retention. Stream consistently for generating regular viewers as they can't come to watch, if there's nothing to watch! On the flip side, don't stream too much, or you'll burn yourself out, or have no new content. Keep it healthy, and keep it consistent. 

### Hardware

*This is the most discussed part of streaming, each persons setup is unique, and it's difficult to say there is a perfect setup. What I'm going to do instead is explain to you the necessity of each component, and how it's critical to the stream and your viewers experience.* 

1. **CPU**: The CPU (or Processor) is probably the most important aspect regarding the technical side of streaming. If you are using a 1 PC streaming setup, not only is it running the game, it is encoding your content as it broadcasts to Twitch. What is Encoding? Encoding is the process of converting the media content that you are uploading (In this case audio-visual content) and converting it into a standard that Twitch will receive. Encoding is CPU intensive (uses a lot of CPU power) and this means you need a fairly decent CPU. I recommend some of the higher end CPUs in order to give yourself both sufficient processing power, and also some longevity. Buying an introductory processor will only mean you get a short time frame of which to utilize it. Higher end AMD/Intel processors will allow you to get the most for your money because even though it's $100 more, it may last another 2 years until needing to upgrade. 

2. **GPU**: Your GPU (or video card) is essential in running the games that you are playing. The two major players are AMD and nVidia. The better your GPU, the better your graphics will be, and the higher quality your stream will be because of how the game looks. Unless your using the nVidia nvenc encoder, the GPU isn't super critical on the stream technical side of things, mainly just on the game side. 

3. **RAM**: Your RAM (or memory) is all about ""short term memory"" the minimum I would recommend is 8GB, but I highly recommend 16GB or more as Open World games and Survival games are utilizing more since they are temporarily storing data from servers in your RAM client side in order to display it on your machine. RAM significantly helps with multitasking as you start to run a few applications at the same time while you stream. 

4. **HDD/SSD**: Your HDD (Hard Drive Disk) or SSD (Solid State Drive) are all about storage. SSD's are great for storing all your main programs and OS on, and running from there, and using a HDD for storing data is handy. HDD utilize mechanical components in order to run, therefore increasing the odds of fairly, so if your data is important to you, have a backup that is typically a bit larger than your current hard drive, in order to make sure ALL your content is backed up. SSD's use flash memory (the same as Thumb Drives, and this allows them to be faster, and more reliable, as the odds of mechanical failure are slim to none. If you are looking to edit your content on your computer, make sure to have a decent sized HDD so that you can record your stream as you stream it!

5. **Monitors**: Monitors become your best friend as your stream grows. I currently use 3 monitors. *I know right? I'm insane!* but this allows me to have the center monitor act as my main action monitor (the game I'm playing), my left monitor is my OBS screen so I can check my frames, uptime, and see any alerts that are broadcast (*more on this later ;]*), finally my right monitor is for my bot/chat client (I use Ankhbot, again, more on this later).

6. **Webcam**: If you are deciding to use a webcam, it's worth getting a decent one right off the bat. A nice logitech webcam is under $100, but should last you for a couple years!

7. **Microphone**: This is a more difficult decision. Each person has a different way they want to broadcast their audio to their viewers. Many just use a headset, and eventually upgrade to something else once they've established themselves. Others will use something with more umph right from the get go like a Razer Seiren, or a Blue Micophones - Yeti Mic. And even higher, this includes myself, people will use a digital audio input, use a high end studio microphone, and a scissor stand, to record professional quality sound, with more options for effects and the like. 

8. **Network**: It is important that you have ~5mbps upload speed. This will allow you to upload at the recommended encoding bitrate of 2000kbps. 

9. **Capture Card**: for those of you who want to stream console games, a capture card is important. There are a variety of capture cards for old connections and for HDMI. You also have the option of internal or external capture devices. This will reduce the load on your PC as the processor is being used just for encoding as the game is being played on the console. Search for the right capture card for you, and see how it goes!

10. **Peripheral**: This includes mice, keyboard, etc. This doesn't have a major impact on the stream, just get what you like and makes game-play more comfortable for you! 

### Setting Up OBS

1. **First**, [download OBS](https://obsproject.com/), this is the application that this guide is based off of, and while allow you to broad cast your stream to your twitch channel. 

2. **Second**, download ""[CLR Browser](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/)"", this is important to providing your channel with Alerts and other similar add-ons for notifications. 

3. **Third**, follow the instructions to install both of them in order to have your OBS installed, with the CLR Browser Plugin. 

4. **Fourth**, go to your Twitch Dashboard, go to Stream Key, and show your stream key. This is important for OBS to broadcast to your Twitch channel. Go to your OBS Settings-Broadcast Settings and input your stream key into the Play Path/Stream Key section, when you've set Mode to Live Stream, and Streaming Service to Twitch. 

5. **Fifth**, set your encoding bitrate. The golden rule for a non-partnered streamer is around 2000kbps for your Bitrate. Make sure you are using CBR, and I personally use the x264 encoder. 

6. **Sixth**, set your video settings. The golden rule is 1280x720 (720P) with an FPS of 30. 

7. **Seventh**, set your Audio settings to how you like them (desktop audio device and what you want your default microphone to be). I personally have a higher quality, stereo microphone, so I force my Microphone to Mono. 

8. **Eighth**, start creating your scenes. There are two different squares you'll see. Scenes and Sources. Scenes are the unique scenes for say ""Stream Starting"", ""Main Overlay"", ""BRB"", ""Stream Ending"". Sources are the things that are added together to make a scene. This includes images for overlays, graphics, CLR Browsers for alerts/notifications, Text, Webcam, etc. 

9. **Ninth**, do a test stream. This is important for you to gauge if your quality settings are at the right place for you, and allows you to fine tune them. 

### Branding

1. **Logo**: Your logo is your face. Find something professional, but at the same time catches the eye and helps draw a theme for you! 

2. **Overlays**: Whether you buy them online, have someone make them, or make them yourself, overlays help enhance your stream scene. Keep it simple, while still adding flair. Recently I removed some stuff from mine so there was more game space for what I am playing, while still displaying the same information for viewers regarding latest follower, donation, etc. 

3. **Information Panels**: On your channel, you have information panels at the bottom. Use them to your advantage. I highly recommend having a schedule panel, links to your various social media, etc. Creating your own panels, that match your general theme, are worth it to create that Branding we are aiming for. You are a product, you don't want crappy packaging. 

4. **Social Media**: Try and match all your social media to your channel name. This breeds familiarity with all the folks you are networking with. They will recognize the name across all different social media platforms. Reddit, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. 

### Streaming! The Good Part!
*This is going to be general tips to help you on your path to becoming a great entertainer. There's ALWAYS room for improvement, even the best streamers and entertainers have room for improvement*

1. **Don't be quiet**: Talk to your viewers, whether it's 0 or 100. Talk to yourself, talk about what your doing, talk about the song, just go full blown ADHD and keep up the pace. Not only will this provide content and dialogue, it'll help you workout your vocal cords so that you can talk for extended periods. 

2. **Minimize off screen time**: Try and minimize the amount of AFK time that you have. If you are younger, let your parents know you are streaming. Explain to them what you're doing, and hopefully they understand. Let them know how long you'll usually stream for, and if they absolutely need something, to let you know before hand, or via a text message. Nothing is worse than Mom busting in telling you to take your underwear out of the bathroom. 

3. **Don't play oversaturated games**: Try to avoid what I call the ""Top 4"", LoL, Dota2, CS:GO, Hearthstone, unless you are REALLY good at those games. They are competitive games, and you are competing with professionals of those games and giant tournaments. Try to stream games that are around 500-3K viewers, unless it is only one broadcaster with that many viewers. 

4. **Don't call out lurkers**: Don't even get your bots to do it. It's tacky, and WILL make most people leave. Some people just want to sit back and see how you are. They're trialing you out, and you don't want a ""BUY MY ALBUM"" mid song. 

5. **Don't ask for donations**: This can come across as pathetic to some people. By all means, have a donation goal for whatever you are aiming for, just don't ask. 

6. **Be Confident!**: People like seeing someone who's comfortable, confident, and knows what they are doing, or, if you don't, ""Fake it until you make it!""

7. **Network, Network, Network**: The best way to network imo, is to support other streamers, and organically support their endeavours. What do I mean by ""organic""? I mean don't force it. Find streamers you actually like and enjoy, who are around your size, and show your support because you care about THEIR stream, not just yours. Eventually you'll see the favour returned. 

8. **Create Channel Competitions**: These can breed fan loyalty and help turn people from lurkers to regulars and super engaged community members!

### Bots (The Good Kind)
*I'm only gonna list the major three free bots* 

1. **AnkhBot**: This is my favourite, so some bias here. It is entirely free, and allows you to create a custom named bot, and will integrate with Google Docs and save everything there in the cloud. It has Song Requests, Giveaways, ""Bank Heists"" - which you can change to a custom mini game, A Sound FX System through commands, timers, Currency and Ranks, Quotes, and more! Underneath that all it has moderation capabilities for blocking links and language and lets you ban people from the chat console. 

2. **Nightbot**: A free, web based bot, that provides moderation capabilities, song requests, and custom commands. 

3. **MooBot**: Similar to NightBot in that it is cloud based. Includes song requests and more.

### Security

1. Create a separate email, that doesn't include your name anywhere. This will create a divide between you and your online persona. Batman doesn't go around telling everyone he's **[REDACTED]** does he?

2. If creating a paypal, upgrade to a business account, and make sure all your information is kept private. Your address may be displayed when you purchase things, but this will protect you when users pay you money and it displays your information. I recommend using the Name of ""Channel's Twitch Channel"". 

3. **DON'T USE SKYPE WITH VIEWERS**, heck unless you 100% trust random viewers, don't even use TeamSpeak. Discord is is a new app that secures your ip to prevents users from obtaining your ip.

4. Don't give too many details out about your location, and if you invite friends/family (I recommend not doing that so that you create an independent identity) make sure they don't address you by your name. Get a PO Box if you'd like to send things to viewers without worrying about them get your personal details. 

5. Ensure your Steam Profile is changed to your new channel specific email. If you send a game to someone for a giveaway, it will show your personal email unless you change it.

3lb0sw,"Took a month off, some perspective","I was streaming for about 1 1/2 years, got up to 2,500 followers but views were stuck at around ~30 per stream. Things just started to feel stale, burnout was real, and I didn't have time to do some of the programming things I love to do.  

So I stopped, my last stream was back in the middle of August.  

The last few weeks I've done much more coding, I've been going out for meals with my wife more and generally just doing a hard reset on life. It's been refreshing, I've worked a lot on our home and gotten a lot done both digitally and just doing odd jobs around the house I've been meaning to do, finishing things I've meant to get done for close to a year.  

Despite all this, our Minecraft server is getting a big update this weekend and I decided it'll also be my return to streaming. Most likely not on as intense a schedule as I was before (3-4 days a week, 4-5 hours per day), but I miss playing games with the community and finding the fun of being with a group.  

I moved my office space in the house, got a new haircut, and am blowing away EVERYTHING from the old look &amp; starting from scratch. Hopefully with some time, some different games, and a different approach I can get somewhere again. I plan to ease into the new schedule up until October where I'll be going back to my online roots (from almost a decade ago) and jumping back into Halo with H5 Warzone gameplay.  

I just wanted to post this in case someone else was considering a hiatus, or to put things into perspective. While a lot of us here want to make it big, there will be low points, and sometimes the best thing you can do is take a break, step back and re-evaluate what you're doing.  

This isn't meant to discourage anyone, but instead show that being offline and being healthy is just as important as schedule and streaming often. Balance is important, and it'll make you a better streamer and a better person overall.   

If this helps even one person, it's worth it. I just wanted to share this and put it out there. Until then, see you online.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3lb0sw/took_a_month_off_some_perspective/,1442500095.0,58,0.91,43,Twitch,Legundo

**VIDEO**: https://youtu.be/qnEfhWRX3OA

It's just me reading this post with some rocket league gameplay in the back. However if you can't play the video or listen to sound, here's the biggest wall of text you'll read today.

**Disclaimer**:
For about 3 months now streaming has kind of consumed my entire life, I don’t currently  make a living at this, nor am I partnered with Twitch.

**Backstory**:
Just to give a little bit of context to what I’m saying, I want to talk about the last 3 months or so of my life. I got back from college in June, took a week or two off from programming and game development, and just played games. Towards the end of my break, I started thinking that I should stream what I was playing. Why not, I had dabbled with it before a few times, it’s fun, and maybe I’ll get a new follower or two.

I already had a Twitch account, streaming software, and most things set up. I met some really cool streamers and got raided a number of times. In a few weeks I was breaking 300 followers and had 10 or so people watching me most nights. I was actually streaming. People enjoyed watching me play games with my friends or code new features to games I’m making.

At this point I saw a short documentary produced by a popular streamer, “Valkia.” He had been streaming for 6 months, had 10 thousand followers, and was now a partner with Twitch. He wasn’t coming from a background in YouTube or another site and just pulling followers from elsewhere, but had entertained and grew a fan-base in 6 months to 10k people.

In a few weeks of on/off buggy streaming on an unprofessional channel with no marketing or self promotion with shitty intrusive overlays and mediocre quality, I had hit 300 followers.

**New Mentality**:
About 3 weeks ago I decided to start from scratch. Except this time I was going to do things “right.” I didn’t sleep, eat, or really do anything else for a week besides getting the new channel set up. I created banners, logos, switched Twitter handles, made an Instagram account, swapped account names for my YouTube channel that already had a few subs, did about a thousand test streams to work on maximizing the quality I could put out that will still be easy enough to display on mobile devices. While none of these were particularly hard for my skill-set, (editing videos, graphic design, tech stuff) There was/is a lot to do, and it just took time to do it all to the level that I was satisfied with.

The week after that I had to cancel all my streams because friends were moving back to college and I just didn’t have the time to devote and make each stream the quality that I wanted.


Last week was my first week of streaming with the new mentality. I’d make every stream count like I already had 10 thousand followers. The first day was normal, and exactly what you’d expect from a channel that had around 100 followers.  Anywhere from 1-5 viewers or so a night, nothing to special, a host from some other streamers who knew I was switching channels, and that was about it. 

The second night was a little bigger. I had posted to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook after my last stream, and just before starting the second stream. I had around 10 concurrent viewers, and was talking/interacting with everyone. If someone came in asking about a giveaway or just saying hey, I’d welcome them to the stream, and actively try to engage them. If they didn’t feel like saying anything or really talking much, I’d get back to playing, but pretend like there were more people really there. When you look at your viewer count and it says 5 people, and drops down to 4, it can be really discouraging. It’s feels like 20% of your viewer base doesn’t want to see what you’re doing, or just did. I ignored the concurrent viewer count, and knew that the point isn’t to get followers or viewers or make money. The point is to be putting out the highest quality content that I know I’m capable of producing. I’m making the stream I want to watch, and if I get followers or donations, it’s a bonus.

The third night was drastically different. I had posted to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook before the stream, highlighted clips from the night before, uploaded those to YouTube, and posted them to the appropriate forums/subreddits. All of that was done before I even started broadcasting. I checked my email and had a dozen or so new followers without even streaming. That’s different.

I booted up the stream, got to playing, same attitude, and within an hour or so had 10 people watching. The same 10 people hung out and talked to me for about 7 hours or so, at which point I checked and had around 20 people watching. No raids, no one on skype, just me entertaining. at this point I was near 180 followers, had about 25-30 throughout the night up to this point, and told everyone who was in the stream that I wouldn’t stop the stream until I hit 200. I was 20 away, and 7 hours in. I have the time, I was enjoying myself, so why not.

At this point 3 people donated around 5 dollars total, which for anyone who streams, is amazing. Having anyone validate what you’re doing with their own money is one of the best feelings in the world.

At around 8 hours I checked the viewer count again and there were 35 people watching. No raids, no hosts, just me. I talked to people and engaged, talked about other things I stream, and said If anyone was enjoying the content to drop a follow. in about a half hour I jumped past 200 to 215, had 46 people watching, and it was all on me. I did that. A few hours later I ended the stream, and did some more cross promotion via social media.

The next night was back to normal. But instead of the normal 3 viewers that fluctuates up and down, I had 6. Broke up to 10 a few times, nothing crazy, a few more follows, and eventually ended the stream around 10 hours 13 hours in.

The 4th night got even crazier. While I knew not to expect another groundbreaking night with my most concurrent viewers ever and an influx of new followers, I used it as the bar for the level of entertainment I can produce. It may not be tonight that I have almost 50 people watching me, but I’m going to work my ass off regardless, because if someone comes back and sees that I was only funny or entertaining, or had produced good content when people cared the most, they’d probably leave and not come back.

About 7 hours into the stream, I had been playing rocket league solo queuing and on a 6 hour losing streak. I talked for a bit about how I wasn’t leaving until I could start winning again because I feel that someone proves how good they truly are when they’re at their worst. And just like my attitude with streaming is, that I can prove that this is something I’ll do well regardless of how many people want to watch me or whether or not I’m making money at it. Not long after that a very generous viewer donated $100 dollars. What. I talked with him for a bit about how I was looking for a new headset and eventually going to be getting a new keyboard. A minute or so later he drops another $250 dollar donation. The stream ends a few hours later, I have trouble sleeping because of what just happened.

 Last night was fairly normal, I had anywhere from 5-10 viewers and kept streaming like it was 5 to 10 thousand. 

I guess the major takeaway from this is that as someone who streams, you have to know why you’re doing it. If you casually on/off stream with the hopes of maybe getting raided by five thousand people who all follow you and love your content and change your life forever with million dollar donations, then you can pretty much bet that it won’t happen. I’m striving to produce quality video, audio, gameplay, and maybe a bit of humor, every night knowing that there is a market for what I have to offer. It takes as much work outside of streaming as it does when you’re actually broadcasting. Every day I’m looking for new channels to host for cross promotion, I’m active on all social media outlets I can be, I just created a www.topstreamers.com page that I can offer to followers who maybe can’t donate, but want to help me out more than just following. I’m adding new music to playlists and looking for new games to play. I’m constantly playing with my stream settings to produce the highest quality stream that’s available on the most devices I can. I’ve remade my overlays a dozen or so times to get it to where I like it. I pull from other streams to see what you can be doing better, and am actively practicing in counter strike and rocket league to get to a level that’s worth watching.

It may not always be a groundbreaking night, but if you aren’t enjoying every second of what you’re doing and the content you’re producing, why would anyone else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3ku089/my_new_mentality_towards_streaming/,1442181065.0,70,0.87,68,Twitch,CooperAMA
3kfq8z,"New push notifications are terrible, and should be disabled by default.","Not sure if any devs lurk here, but as the title states.... having your phone go off for like 130+ streamers every few minutes is super annoying. **Having to go to each channel setting and change it is tedious and unnecessary.**

The main twitch app menu should have the ability to disable all, or reset push preferences. 

The latest twitch app update enabled push for ALL STREAMS YOU FOLLOWED WITH EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS BEFORE...which is neither sane nor reasonable.

~~Please fix this.~~

**EDIT**: The devs listened.. *kinda* , **the twitch app now has the slider to mute the push notifications**, but all followed channels still have push enabled by default so your notification bar is still going to be filled with 'now streaming' clutter.

3k8v9h,Cool things you didn't know your stream needed!,"Yep. Another guide by me. This time I'll cover sites/services that are not well known, but streamers should consider making a part of their tool set.  
_  
**[R1CH's Twitch Analyzer](https://r-1.ch/analyzer/)**  
A site that checks your overall stream quality while your stream is running. It checks dropped frames, bitrate, and everything related to quality. Definitely good if people are having issues viewing and you need to know where the problem is coming from.  
**[SubsOnly](https://subsonly.com/)**{Partnership Required}  
Want a website only your subscribers get to see? SubsOnly is the only service that makes this possible, while being completely free. The service is great for those who want to reward their subscribers in a unique way. No coding required to build a site. Very easy to use.  
**[1800Steamer](https://1800streamer.com)**{Partnership Required}  
Put simply, a hotline your subscribers can call during the stream. Inspired by Lirik's hotline, this service is in beta and doing very well. You have complete control over the calls.  
**[Videogami.tv](http://videogami.tv/)**  
While yes, it is a streaming site, this site made its way here because of it's Fan Clip service. Join this site via Twitch account, and you can easily set up a system where fans can make their own highlights of your stream. Very powerful for community building.  
**[Best Games to Stream](http://oofki.net/twitch/)**  
The best of them all. This site checks which games have high viewer counts, but a low number of streamers. Very good if you need to choose what to stream.  
**[TwitchStatus](http://twitchstatus.com/)** suggested by /u/Ramautso  
Need to see if one of Twitch's servers is down? Here's the site you need to see.

3jk3my,Can Youtubers use our footage without permission?! (Copyright Help),"Hello!

Asking for any infos on this. A Youtuber sometimes uses unedited clips of my stream (20-30 seconds) where you can see my face and everything, etc... for his videos. Without permission, didn't even ask. 

Now when I told him that I would appreciate it if he took the videos down or keeps me out of them, he told me that it's none of my business because I have no copyright over my stream because it's public.

Any advice? Can Youtubers just use clips of our streams without permission?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3jk3my/can_youtubers_use_our_footage_without_permission/,1441326864.0,51,0.85,33,Twitch,Nukibuki
3jgwwy,Looking for low viewer-channels to host when I end my stream,"Hey guys,

I don't know if this is allowed or not, but I lurk here every now and then (this is a throwaway account by the way) and I figured I'd give something back to the community.

I run a Twitch Stream with around 500-800 viewers. Before, whenever I went offline I would grab a random streamer with very few viewers and host him/her. Their gratitude made my day, and I think I made their as well! I didn't ask them for permission before from them for hosting them before, but that was back when I didn't have a lot of viewers myself.

My channel's getting bigger and as such I can't really just randomly host someone any more without asking for permission. Not everyone likes the surge of exposure. So I'm trying to build a small list of low-viewer streams and whenever I end my stream I'll pick one of them and host them.

If you're interested, you can send me a PM with a link to your channel. However **please read this first**:

* I am in CEST time zone and my streams usually end late evening or around midnight. If you're not streaming during this time there's not really any point for you to apply.

* You have to talk english.

* If you play Hearthstone, the chance of my viewers staying around will be a lot higher. The chance of me picking your channel to host will also be a lot higher.

* I hold no responsibility for what my viewers say or do once they arrive to your channel. They've been acting pretty nicely on my hosts so far but you never know with Twitch chat. Unless you have thick skin you should not apply.

* Remember that if you do get hosted, most people will give you 10-15 seconds to decide if this random person that just popped up if worthy of their time or not. The way you welcome the viewers will heavily affect how many stick around. Acknowledge them, interact with them and chances are you'll keep more of them. Don't feel down if you lose a lot of them though - that will happen no matter what you do. Usually my host kicks in with 300-400 viewers. Within 5 minutes, maybe 150 are left. Amongst those 150 is where your potential future regulars may hide!

* I'm more likely to pick you if it looks like you're putting in an effort with your stream/if I feel you deserve more viewers. Like, you're doing everything right but your stream just hasn't gotten enough exposure yet to take off.

* If you post your stream in the comments instead of PM'ing me that signals that you didn't go through the effort of reading through my post and you're just browsing around here to quickly find ways to get more viewers. Once again, if you don't put in the proper effort to get more viewers, I'm not going to serve them for you on a silver platter.

So umm, yeah. Hope I'm not breaking any rules with this. Any questions can be posted in the comments and your channels can be sent to me by PM! :)

Edit: Oh, another thing, I probably won't respond to any PMs, I'll just read them, browse around a bit and then grab one of the channels whenever I end my stream. So don't take it personal if I don't reply, I still read your PM!

Edit2: I'm getting a lot of people saying ""good luck to the person that gets picked"" etc and I want to make it clear that I'll probably pick different people at the end of each stream. So you might not get hosted tonight, but that doesn't mean you're out of chances.

Edit3: Wow this blew up. Just a word of warning - you all do seem like wonderful people, but I've gotten like 50 PMs. So please don't feel offended if you don't get a host. I hope my thread might inspire other people to do the same thing, or if anyone of the people I host actually start growing I hope you'll pay it forward!

Edit4: Two hosts in, things are going OK. I think my viewers are a bit more spammy than some of you guys are used to though. I have pretty relaxed moderation in my chat and that's what my viewers like and are used to. Just another heads up. Sub mode/slow mode/timeouts will quickly make them lose interest but I will let you guys decide how to deal with the spam.

3jd49c,how to display heart rate while streaming,"How to display your Realtime Heart Rate by using Mio Link

I play a lot of Horror Games and wanted to display my Heart Rate
I really wanted to use wrist band instead of chest band due to convenience 

* I tested this in Windows 7 64bit machine, not sure about Mac or other Platform
although both OBS and Golden Cheetah had Mac version and I believe Hardware should work on other platform too

You will need 4 items to achieve this

1) OBS (This is free streaming sotware)
2) Mio Link Heart Rate Monitor (This is a wrist band to measure HR) * Can be purchased at Amazon
3) Suunto Movestick Mini (This is receiver that plugs in to PC to read HR) * Can be purchased at Amazon
4) Golden Cheetah (This is a program to display your HR to PC)

Steps:

1) Setup OBS (this should be simple! if you are streaming, you should already have OBS)
2) Install Golden Cheetah (Just do default Install)
3) Plugin Suunto Movestick to PC (PC should automatically install driver, if not go to Device Manager and force it to look for driver)
4) Wear Mio and turn on the Heart rate monitor
5) Run Golden Cheetah and connect Mio Link to PC (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Train Devices)
6) Start Measuring the Heart Rate within Golden Cheetah
7) Use OBS to get application to show up and use crop option to only get numbers area
8) use chromakey option in OBS to leave the number to show and hide background
9) use coloring option to change color of the number

3ja0ed,"A few guidelines to grow you channel, and not feel awkward about it","**Hello**   
I have 3 years experience working with both big and small streamers and now I do it full-time (yay). I also run a Twitch centered blog and podcast. Not sure if it's okay to post my websites, but can PM a moderator for verification.    

This was supposed to be a response in the other thread but it turned into a very long post and in hope that it reaches more people than those that dig into a old thread. I know the other thread wasn't suppose to be a how-to guide, but I wanted to give you insight from someone that's already working with streamers and not getting into it.    

These are my ideas and what I go over with my clients. There's no step by step guide, you need to analyze each thing and then apply what is relevant to you. 

These are in no particular order.

----------


**Visual branding**  
These are not needed when you start out, when you start out you should first of all be comfortable with a slew of other things. First of all if you even can handle streaming, secondly if you can handle the schedule that you've set out to do, thirdly that you can deliver the same quality of content. It's not about doing well once it's about repeating it. A lot of time it's about failure but never let the failure pile on top of you, instead you need to stand above each failure. There's no waiting to find the unicorn, do something instead of nothing and if you fail that's fine as long as you do it again.

A visual brand isn't something that just looks good. It's suppose to help your overall brand and enhance what is that you do on your channel. If it don't then it's working against you. There's a thousand things that goes over exactly what a Twitch visual brand can and should contain, but there's no one size fits all.

**Niche (making people come and people stay)**
It's nothing harder than getting an audience, or at least that's what people let you know. A niche can be a game you play if it's small, but you still need to stand out within that, are you the best? are you a teacher? etc. In a big game it's even more important and NO a good community and good entertainment isn't a niche anymore, it's already expected from you. You need to dig a big deeper and don't be afraid to dig too deep. There's hundreds and maybe thousands that share whatever small thing you think only you like. And overtime you can broaden that spectrum when your followers are sold on you.

Look at you channel as a sub-reddit. Each one serves a different purpose, even if it's for the same thing, those that left one thing came to the other because it wasn't exactly what they wanted. 

Finding where they are is another issue. If you're trying to find cat owners on a dog forum you'll probably have a really bad time. But it's also that simple when you do know what your target audience and your niche is. You figure out where they are and you go there and you talk.

**Schedule**  
The typical ""Twitch schedule"" has become bad thing over the last couple of months. More often than not do I see small streamer burn out due to them chasing a unicorn. If a daily thing x-amount of hours don't work for you, then don't do that. Figure out what works for you and then use that in your branding.

You do not foster a community around a schedule, you build trust around it. You foster the community around either a personal brand (you) or a brand/game. Your schedule is something you can lean on but not build your house on. However it's possible to build something around a schedule but then you need to do that consciously, it don't happen only because you have a schedule.

**Social Media**  
A beast if you know what you're doing, complete shit if you have no clue, even worse if you take advise from someone that have no idea about it. The only thing you're doing is bring attention to bad content. Your content is number 1, not your networking, not your social media and not your promotion. It all comes down to your content at the end of the day.

Social media plays by the same game as you do when you create content. You're after all creating content there as well. It's not a ASK thing. No one wants to be asked to do anything from someone they don't know or someone they don't owe anything. You're starting at the wrong end of things. You're suppose to be the one giving not asking.

**Marketing strategy**   
Don't market content that's shit. Again that will only bring faster attention to how bad your content is and leave a bad aftertaste. Know you content before anything else. When you know your personal brand and what your content is then it's time to actually start to figure out the right strategy for you. Your PB and your content changes over the years so it's not a set it and forget it type of thing, it's constantly something you have to be aware of.

You need to understand that each platform you use for your marketing is different. What you do on facebook won't work on twitter, what you do on twitter won't work on instagram and what you do on instagram won't work on snapchat. Don't ever feel forced to use them all or even specific ones. Understand your own brand and what people you want in your channel and figure out where they are, what speak to them and what is valuable about your channel to them.

As for what you actually post we're talking value again. Self promotion is going to feel really bad if it's a ASK, most ads, popups are asking for your time and give nothing. We as humans scan if it's a ask or if it's a give. We ignore ask and we follow a give. Who don't like free stuff? What to give? Depends on what content you're producing, sorry that I can't give you a step by step but there really isn't any. You need to analyze what it is that you do and who you are for anything to have an effect. 

**Interaction**  
This is fun. Again there's no ""you have to do it like this, because this is how other do it"". If you're not the type of person that like to talk or isn't talkative, you need to work on that over time. However you are a leader, you are the one that are leading your channel. You have to be aware of this. Some great leaders aren't born with charisma and all that stuff, they get it when they are leaders. There's a great This American Life or Radio Lab podcast about it, the name escapes me right now but I'll try to dig it up. Are you starting to see the pattern? There's no ""must-do"" or ""must-have"". It should all come from who you are and what goals you set. Of course there's a few technical musts but when it comes to the things that you do there's no absolute way, that way will change and if all you're trying to do mimic what someone did 3 or 2 years ago you're going to be 3 or 2 years behind the curve. Take inspiration from their story and apply it to your own but don't take it as a guide.  


**Do it for fun**   
You know what all of these stuff don't stop you from having fun and if one of them are then don't do that. There's no must do, if not doing something makes your stream better then that's great. You're doing something else right and what's not wrong. Still you should try it all out, remember failure is a good thing. If it don't work for you then it don't work, but unless you try whatever strategy you come up with you won't know if it's good or bad.

3j32jy,The must-have checklist for new streamers,"As someone who is venturing in the world of livestreaming Marketing i'm wondering what are your thoughts on this topic. A must-have checklist is a set of items no new streamer should forget about if they're willing to pursue a career out of it. Mind helping me put together an efficient list?

**Items so far:**

**Entry-level graphic branding**

Panels, Offline Picture, etc. Your brand will develop over time and you are not expected to have a fully awsome layout for everything. However it is a must to have at least some sort of setup and scheme going on.

**Schedule**

While not mandatory for casual streamers, this is quite a requirement for those who want to foster a community.

**Stream activities**

Rather than asking your 2 viewers what they want you to play and wasting a lot of time figuring out things. Try to have your activities already planned out. People will stay if they like you and they will definitely not enjoy someone who takes 30 minutes to set up a game or activity.

**Social Media**

You don't need to be active on every platform. Consider Twitter and Facebook a must. Youtube and Instagram are also good enough to be mentioned but avoid exhausting your free time with things you know won't help that much (unless the community you attract does hang out in those channels, i.e pinterest, tumblr, etc).

**Promotion plan**

Oh yes. Take your time and figure out where to promote your stream. If all you do is Tweet ""I'm live guysss!!"" chances are you won't get that much attention. And i'm not talking about spamming either, avoid that at all costs: be creative and not a pain in the neck.


I may be forgetting a couple of things but bare with me, didn't sleep at all. Please do comment on what you think the items for this kind of list should be. Cheers!

Now don't get too excited straight away! The article clearly states that *Flash content, such as ads or auto-playing videos on* **non-video websites** *, will be automatically paused by default.* Now if I am reading this correctly, this will not affect the ads which are delivered on Twitch, which I guess is very good for Twitch - but this does not make this news any less exciting!

A big issue currently with Twitch is the way they have to deliver ads to the end-user. Twitch use a Google affiliated company to deliver ad-content called DoubleClick (This information may be out-dated, but I'm pretty sure they use DoubleClick still) Now the issue with this is that a lot of business still push Flash-based ads through these services, and they currently show no interest in stopping this as it requires a lot of work on their part and advertising companies are inherently slow at keeping up with new technologies.

Fortunately, this change from Google is going to force them to change - otherwise they will lose a substantial amount of revenue! This may then result in the push to a complete HTML5 site to come a bit sooner than expected. It still will not be soon™, don't expect anything in a week, but this is still good news to all Flash-hating fanatics around the world! 

**EDIT: Sorry about the wording in the title. They will not be out-right BLOCKED, but they will NOT be allowed to auto-play. The user will have to click if they want the Flash content to play instead.

3gvarf,BEGINNERS CHECKLIST: What Do I Need For Streaming and how can I improve the brand?,"Twitch and streaming has changed A LOT over the years.  At first it was just a gamer hopping on streaming some video games and talking over the gameplay. Now however people have added overlays, webcams, music, green screens, pop ups, donations, and even contests into their stream. In this little checklist/guide I will help some of the new streamers/people who want to stream better their broadcast in way that will entice people to at least check out the stream. This is assuming that you have researched the requirements for your PC and determined you are capable of streaming from it. 

1. **OBS** Download obs.  This allows you to stream and IMO is much better than any Capture card software and or Xsplit. It is free and has tons of features to better your stream graphically and even mechanically.

2. **PERSONA** Know what audience you want to attract.  Are you a console or PC player? Do you play mainly sports games or shooters? Are you an older casual gamer or a younger competitive gamer? Grasp what type of gamer you are and incorporate that into your stream.

3. **GAMES** Before setting your stream and turning it on, have an idea of what games you will be playing that day. A lot of people will come in for the current game on stream but others would like to know what you might play after. Not knowing could cause that viewer to not want to around or come back for it.  If you do know however that viewer might enjoy that game and want to wait around for it or even come back at a later time to watch it.

4. **TITLE** The title is the most important thing next to the thumbnail (which you cant control as of yet).  Entice people to want to click on you rather than the people to the left and right of you.  Put something in the title that people might laugh about or be curious about.  Something like ""Playing H1Z1"" is not that lol. 

5. **GRAPHICS** This isn't always easy and takes some time but it is a very big deal when it comes to branding.  Not everyone knows someone to help them by making graphics (overlays, info tabs under the stream, donation images, follower images etc).  Try to find someone who will make the previous images for you.  Its key to make them all match. The better the graphics look the better it is for viewing experience.  Refer to my page for an idea of what im talking about. Keep in mind graphics are not expensive but are not usually free either. This step IMO is crucial.  Anyone with a acceptable easy to remember logo is also easy to brand and remember.

6. **ALERTS** Everyone has these now-a-days.  Its a great touch.  For those who don't know what this is, its a alert that pops up on your stream when you receive a follow, donation, host etc. You can customize the image that pops up, how it pops up, what it says, and even the sound it makes when it does pop up.  You can get this feature from twitchalerts.com.  They have tutorials on how to set them up and tbh its VERY simple.  Viewers do in fact like to get recognized for following or donating and to be completely honest they should be.  They are taking the time to show their appreciation by following (which in my eyes says I like you enough to come back in the future.) and donating their hard earned money (Or Moms). This should be shown to the entire stream. Some people might be bummed out if you don't have that alert available when they do it.  How would you know they donated unless you had your paypal open and constantly refresh? How would you know someone followed unless you had your email opened constantly.  These alerts help you with that process and reward those viewers that compensate you for the hard work that you are putting in. 

7. **MICROPHONE** Credit to u/ShawnTheBoy . This is a big one too... The biggest thing when streaming is interacting with viewers and honestly who wants to have to type in the chat while playing a game? No one. That's where this mic comes in. The next question is what kind of mic? I use studio quality mic and it sounds wonderful however it is expensive.  For some people a bad quality mic is a complete turn off and they will leave instantly.  The better sounding the mic is the better shot you have. Depending on how serious streaming is for you I would advise buying a good mic. The mic I use is the Blue Yeti but others really like the Audio Technica AT2000 as well. 

8. **WEBCAM** A webcam isn't as important but a lot viewers really do like to see who is playing the games.  They like to know who they are watching. I personally have the Logitech c920.  Its up to you on the camera but again if you are going to buy the above suggestions you might as well do the same for the webcam.  I personally would rather have great quality or no webcam.  I don't like the in between.  Ive watched streams where its really hard to tell certain things in a persons webcam due to pixilation and fuzziness. You don't want that.  If you decide to get a webcam (which most do) you can get a very good one for $70. 

9. **PATIENCE** Credit to u/Dartemis No one gets anywhere over night. Streaming takes a long time to build up an audience for almost anyone. No one gets popular over night, unless they get really lucky or know the right people.

**Honorable mentions**

A. Make yourself an info tab that allows people to looks and see what your setup is, maybe FAQ, links to your youtube/twitter etc.

B. Have trustworthy friends as moderators who wont ban people without reason.

C. Have a bot in the chat like nightbot. Just go to twitch.tv/nightbot and type !Nightbot Join.  The bot will enter your channel and moderate it without having to tell it to do anything.

This is just a quick summary of some of the essentials and options that can help your stream be a better overall experience.  If people feel welcome and have a home feeling when they join they are more likely to stay and come back again! Any questions please feel free to ask and I would be glad to help to the best of my ability.  Others im sure will help as well. If any others reading have any other checklist items or necessities to help the stream PLEASE POST. I will add and give you credit if it fits! Thanks guys!

3gsfpg,"""Don't look at your viewer count.""","This is my first week of streaming. I knew going into it that it would be a slog. I knew it takes time to get traction, to learn your on screen personality, and so on. And I knew I shouldn't look at my viewer number. What I didn't know is why.

I figured the main reason not to look is because one would act differently. Some people don't know that they need to talk with even zero viewers. A sudden uptick in viewers and one gets nervous. And so on.

But no, the real reason you shouldn't look at your viewer count (or at least *I* shouldn't) is what happens when it goes down. I immediately start doubting myself, struggling to understand why that person didn't stick around. Was I not entertaining? Were they bored? Is my voice weird? Maybe I play wrong? ... obviously, when all these thoughts rush through your head, you stop focusing on what's happening now. Instead, you're stuck on what happened just prior.

So, from here forward, no more looking at my viewer numbers until after a stream ends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3gsfpg/dont_look_at_your_viewer_count/,1439425107.0,99,0.97,57,Twitch,Rizorty
3ghw2h,Do you accept tips? LEAVE THEM IN YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT,"I'd like to point to [this](https://twitter.com/lolrenaynay/status/630809748753920000) tweet from streamer /u/Lolrenaynay.

---

Chargebacks are a serious issue, and it is a system often abused by trolls on Twitch. 

There is a grace period, in which someone who tipped(Donated) to you on Paypal can request a refund or chargeback, which is currently an absurd 180. To be on the safe side, you should leave any money you receive in your account, for at least a few weeks, just to be sure the person does not want it back. 

For larger donations, I'd say $30 and up, leave it in for the whole 180 days. 

Adding to that, Paypal will charge fees for processing chargebacks, and those fees, guess what, are on YOUR SHOULDERS. That's right. People give you money, then they want it back, and you're stuck paying any fees. 


 Always recommended for personal safety reasons, is upgrading your Paypal account to a [business account](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/helphub/article/?solutionId=FAQ900). 

Also, donations services like [TwitchAlerts](http://www.twitchalerts.com) have a system in place, where people who chargeback are banned from tipping again. This does a pretty good job of weeding out the trolls. 

These threads come up time and again, but they're crucial in safeguarding the Twitch community. If anyone has any more tips, please, list them below :) 

EDIT--

According to /u/rbundi87,
&gt;Lets just be clear here. PayPal does not charge you a charge back fee. The credit card company does or bank. Your processor whether it be stripe, square, or paypal they are all charged a fee of around 500-700 dollars and you are charged the 20.00. Processors do not like charge backs just as much as the seller does.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3ghw2h/do_you_accept_tips_leave_them_in_your_paypal/,1439232595.0,152,0.97,126,Twitch,LtRoyalShrimp

3gd4k7,Comedy and you: a guide to improv on Twitch,"Hey all, my name is Jorpen. I'm a full time streamer/ Twitch browser/amateur funnyman who spends way too much time watching streams. One thing I notice about a lot of streams, is that while they're super interactive, some don't have that ""comedic charm"" that really sells me on a someone's broadcast. While this isn't a bad thing (everything is subjective, you don't have to like everything, Jorpen you're dumb, etc.) I figured I could help out my fellow broadcasters with some of my tips and advice on how to get better at improv on Twitch. Keep in mind that humor is **INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE** and what I find funny/the techniques I use may either be appalling, horrifying, incredibly hilarious, or all of the above to you.

**1. Roll with the punches (aka yes, and):** One of the core tenets of improv is the ""yes, and"" rule. Basically what you do is you take whatever happens, and build upon it; don't ever say no.

For example, while playing a game, if something weird comes up that you don't necessarily understand or agree with. Try to work around it. I play a lot of RPGs, and let me tell you, these games have a ton of weird shit in them. I try not to dismiss anything they do immediately as weird or dumb, but instead I either make fun of it, work around it, or just embrace the weird. Don't just say no and move on, try to work off everything.

**2. Don't be afraid:** So, as a new streamer, you find yourself trying to find your style. You crack a few jokes and you've got chat laughing, great! Suddenly, the worst event imaginable happens; a joke falls flat. FailFish's consume your chat, as your dreams of being a funnyman vanish before your eyes.

**Do not let jokes failing stop you!** Comedy, like any other form of art or entertainment, requires a ton of practice. You are going to fall flat on your face many, many times before you really succeed. Great comedians weren't just born funny, they practiced working on their craft for hours on end, molding jokes and their own style of funny.

**3. Experiment:** Keep trying new things until you find your comedic style. Some people really enjoy dry humor, while others really like offensive jokes. Some people just like to hear people screaming at normal occurences, and thats the great thing about comedy; its subjective, which means theres something for everyone! While everyone won't find you funny based on whatever style you enjoy the most, at least you'll find a crowd *you* enjoy and can work off of.

Finally, the most important point:

**4. Enjoy it:** If you don't enjoy your own comedy, than who will? You need to make sure you actually love what you do, or else it will show, trust me. People can tell when you're not being genuine, and they will rip you to shreds over it. Find what you love and what makes you laugh, and roll with it. You'll feel great for it, and people will hopefully laugh with (or at) you!

**TL;DR: Roll with whats going on, never be afraid, find your style, and ENJOY YOURSELF. Also did I mention that comedy is subjective? Comedy is subjective.**

Hopefully my little mini guide here can help you on your path to comedy stardom. Comedy makes the world go round, and I hope you can try and make it a better place with your own lil' comedy corner. If you're still having trouble figuring stuff out, or want specific examples, watch other funny streamers and comedians! A lot of people do comedy out of passion, and they'd be glad to help out someone who's still figuring things out!

3fwuel,Something I have been working on - TwitchGrid. Generate a grid of your followers to display on stream.,"Hey /r/twitch,

I am starting out in streaming and made myself a grid background of all my followers to show my appreciation.  As a web dev I thought id have a crack at making a generator so people can make their own and after a few weeks of building it, here it is!  www.twitchgrid.com

I don't know if anyone would find this useful but i'd thought I would post it here.  The website generates a hosted url so its dead easy to integrate in something like OBS.  It requires twitch login, at no point will your email address be used, its the required scope I need for authentication.  

Would love to hear any thoughts/suggestions.  Cheers :)

Here is a quick preview of the grid in action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfuon5wRQ5M

3fsmn1,Should we all fake SWAT strikes on our streams for free publicity from Twitch?,"This is meant as a discussion about what happened after a well-known streamer faked a SWAT invasion on his stream as the finale. Twitch rewarded him for this behavior with a joke of a ""ban"" (24 hours), giving him an insane amount of free publicity and giving him an even bigger stream when he came back today. He's been making fun of the ban the entire time, tweeting about being in jail and putting bars over his webcam. 

Swatting is extremely dangerous and illegal behavior. Making light of legitimate swatting teaches kids that they'll be rewarded with the attention that they desire. It says that swatting is funny and okay and that a **real** SWAT strike might be even funnier! People can die from swatting. Family members have had guns pointed at them and even had heart attacks from the stress and fear induced. 

I don't have a problem with the streamer in question, most of the time. I think that he works hard to produce good content for his fans. However, faking a SWAT attack was not okay and should be dealt with by Twitch, not rewarded. 

So what do you guys think? Should I fake a SWAT attack to bring more attention to my stream? Or should I do it to someone else, since it's so funny?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3fsmn1/should_we_all_fake_swat_strikes_on_our_streams/,1438722262.0,258,0.85,204,Twitch,IAmDisciple

This is NOT because of anything bad or a sudden lack of desire to continue managing and developing our foundation for this awesome part of the Twitch world. I would only ever leave here if there was an even better way of helping out all within the Twitch universe that I care about so much. And therefore...

I am leaving because Twitch have brought me on board! **I am now the Community Manager of Education!!!**

I start this week in this entirely new role, something I am incredibly excited to get underway! As the Manager of Education I will be providing more knowledge, empowerment and support to you broadcasters, to your viewers, and to everyone involved in the Twitch community!

I want you all to know just how fulfilling and wonderful it's been as lead of this sub for the past 1.5 years. I have seen some awesome growth here (from 3k subs when I began to over 35k today!) and have loved finding new ways to facilitate information sharing, stream development, and community events that encourage you all to become more empowered and educated on your road to broadcaster success! Together, we have seen the evolution of the look to this sub, enhanced tools and features myself and my team have developed in many late nights (tools that will continue to be developed as well!), and we have collaborated as a community on ideas and services which some of you have worked to create for the benefit of all. I will take with me what you have all taught me about your needs and wishes into my new role, and make it a priority to provide you further tools and information that will help you grow even more.

As for who will take over lead of this sub, it has been unanimously decided by the mod team that /u/distortednet will carry the torch! I cannot say enough good things about this guy. He is wise, smart, funny, skilled, compassionate, intuitive, patient, and fair. He has a great ability for vision and seeing a big picture on how this place can be even better for you all. The whole team is a great group and together I know they'll continue to maintain this place as the awesome useful and welcoming environment it's grown to be. 

Again, thank you all so much for your support and for the care you all give each other. Don't ever stop helping each other and working together in awesome collaborative ways &lt;3

3f0ty2,Heads up to streamers planning to upgrade to Win10,"While browsing through the PCMR subreddit reading about the new Win10 upgrades that started rolling out today, I came across a post noting that, by default, Windows uses your machine to host updates to other PCs over the net (it is essentially seeding these updates from your machine). [Here is the article from the Windows site](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-delivery-optimization-faq). As most of you know, there really aren't many things a typical PC user needs a decent upload speed for so this won't bother most people but as streamers dependent on upload speeds, this feature may be something you will want to turn off as it could eat into your upload and cause issues with your cast. 

**NOTE**: The possibility of this impacting upload speeds to the point of causing interference with a stream is purely assumption as I have not tested this myself. Just thought I would make a post so folks knew that this feature IS default when you upgrade to Win10, so if you experience issues after upgrade, this might be a good thing to rule out first.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3f0ty2/heads_up_to_streamers_planning_to_upgrade_to_win10/,1438174169.0,96,0.95,56,Twitch,x_liferuiner

3e5so1,Rolling out the HTML Player UI,"Hey guys,

We've started the rollout of the new video player to 2% of users. We'll be bumping up that number to 100% after we fix any remaining bugs. [Here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8d5MxR1.png).

This player still uses Flash to display video but the entire player interface has been ported to HTML/JS. This puts us one step closer to killing Flash entirely, and you'll hear more from us about that in the coming weeks. Aside from the swanky new UI, we've also improved the native HLS fallback player available on Safari and Microsoft Edge when Flash is unavailable. 

If you're not one of the 2%, you can still demo the new player via the popout/embed player. Visit this url and change the parameter to your favorite channel: http://player.twitch.tv/?channel=monstercat

3e0eqs,Is it easier to be a woman on Twitch? Our team spent weeks researching the myths to bring you this study,"Greetings! 


My background is as a channel moderator on Twitch for about 20 streamers. Some of those are mid-size female streamers. A lot of people don't realize, but female streamers take a pretty frequent stream of abuse from their chatrooms after drive-by viewers decide to come in and spew as many sexist things they can say before they get banned. It's so common to me now that I barely even notice it. 


But ever since /u/spla08 appeared on the female version of Dropped Frames where she had counted up the number of females in the top 100 of Twitch, I wondered why she had to do that by hand and where all the data was. So I went looking.

Turns out, there really was no data to be had. Twitch doesn't collect user gender and third-party studies weren't really available, so I started manually tabulating this information myself, trying to arm myself with data to combat trolls. 

Along the way, I met the owner of Twinge who gave me access to his data and picked up a mixed group of streamers, mods, and some data-minded folks and  we together sorted out some statistics to answer some questions. 

I hope you'll read the following, give us your (constructive) feedback, and watch for more, as this study brought up as many questions as answers. Tell us in the comments what else my team should focus on, and if data is available, we'll consider it.

[Twitch Gender Study](https://infogr.am/gender_infographic)

**Update:** Since there have been some questions, a couple quick words about purpose and data collection methods. 

**Purpose:** To dispel popular myths about women on Twitch and bring some balance to the discussions through data. 

**Data collection methods:** Myself and my team of editors used Twinge, a third-party data collection service, with a toolbar that allowed meta-data to be recorded for each channel. Our initial data-set was the top 2500 channels (by followers) and a random 2500 cross-section of Twitch from the 110k streams in the Twinge database. Gender was determined manually, carefully on each channel individually. This data was then parsed to our team, Twitch Data Science team, and we broke out the most interesting bits for this first infographic. It's not meant to be a full report, although a full report will be presented later. This is meant to spur discussion and feedback. There is a margin of error that should be reduced once we get more data from Twitch's official databases (no timeline on when that'll be, but they've displayed interest in the project).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3e0eqs/is_it_easier_to_be_a_woman_on_twitch_our_team/,1437437569.0,112,0.89,153,Twitch,Moblord

3drowh,Using Social Media Effectively,"Following on from my [Getting Noticed on Twitch guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3clebh/getting_noticed_on_twitch/?ref=search_posts), where I commented on using sites other than Twitch to promote your stream, I wanted to further explain how you can use social media sites effectively. This post will cover:

- Facebook Pages
- Twitter
- Youtube
- Reddit 
- Steam Groups

These are the five that streamers usually find to be most helpful (especially Twitter). Some also find Instagram useful; however, it will not be detailed here as lots of people find it annoying when they have to go to another site to view an image (for example: using it in a Tweet).

**Facebook Pages**  
Out of the 5 this guide covers, Facebook is probably the site that has the most fields for streamers. To create a page from your Facebook account, start by going to [the more button in the top left and selecting 'Create Page'](http://i.imgur.com/i3BbBeJ.png). You can then go through a set-up (or skip it) and your page will be created!


The first thing to do is set up your 'About' pages. Try to make the content appeal to the viewers. [This screenshot has some information for each area](http://i.imgur.com/DkKd5X9.png). An important part of interaction is consistency. Make sure to keep the icon and banners similar, as well as the text you write in the boxes. In addition. you can create a 'Call to Action' button. [This screenshot gives an example of how to set this up](http://imgur.com/gqScRkR.png).
  
  
It is important that you don't leave your page to gather dust; that applies to all the points listed. When streaming, [you can create an event which gives out some details of what you are doing](http://i.imgur.com/T3tALzu.png). Also, [you can add milestones](http://i.imgur.com/XC1jfrH.png). You can use these for a number of reasons, depending on the size of your channel. Of course, you can also use base posts for general announcements. 
  
  
**Twitter**  
Twitter is probably the most commonly used site for streamers promoting themselves. Setting it up is pretty easy! [This is a labeled screenshot of my Twitter (which has been seriously redacted)](http://i.imgur.com/Drn4uk3.png) It includes:  

&gt; 1) Name on banner. This helps get your name accross to viewers quickly.  
&gt; 2) Links on banner. Including these helps get people to you fast.  
&gt; 3) Icon: Try to keep this the same as the one on Twitch and other sites.  
&gt; 4) Name: Create a short name that people can call you by (if possible).   
&gt; 5) Description: Explain what you do, why and the games you play. Include a channel link!  
&gt; 6) Pinned Tweet: If you are proud of something, display it to all the new people to your site. Otherwise, you can expand your description (like I have done).  

The ideal part of Twitter is that it doesn't have to just be you who promotes yourself. Retweets make sharing very easy. To start with, tag other streamers (preferably who are at the same level as you).  If you have a chat bot (which you should), try making a timed message that includes a link to the Tweet and asks them to retweet and favourite it. This means that anyone tagged in the Tweet gets notified that a Tweet they were in was favourited/retweeted. Also, you are kind of advertising that streamer. Therefore, they may advertise you back or even host you. This will really increase viewers. (Side Note: I plan to release something to help with this soon™.)


**Youtube**  
Youtube doesn't really allow you to announce when you are streaming. It is probably the odd one out of these sites. The main reason for Youtube being on this list is that it is simple to export VoDs to and keep them on the site. However, you can still create an 'About' section and add links to other sites. [This screenshot shows how the about section will look while you are editing it](http://i.imgur.com/sT1GCHS.png).  
  
  
**Reddit**  
Reddit is probably the site that the least streamers use. But, it can actually be one of the best. It allows viewers to post discussions and questions to the streamer and other users can then respond to these. This can make people feel very welcome to your community and they may then also look at Twitch, Twitter and other sites.  
  
  
If you do chose to create your own Sub-Reddit, make sure to take care of it. Bear in mind that anyone can post and it may need moderating. Why not ask some of your Twitch moderators to help on your Sub too? Also, make sure to give it a little bit of CSS customization. If you don't now much/any CSS, try [Naut](http://reddit.com/r/Naut) or [have a look at this](https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/wiki/moresnippets). Flairs are also important. If a user is a moderator, why not give them a Twitch moderator icon (like the r/Twitch Sub-Reddit mods do)? Try to create link flairs to help put posts into categories. It helps if a user can just jump to the type of post they are looking for. [Have a look at this for inspiration](http://i.imgur.com/h27FLcG.png). 
  
  
Another important feature on Reddit is the wiki. To create a page, go to http://reddit.com/r/YOUR-SUB-REDDIT/wiki/PAGE-NAME and click the create page option. You can also create groups. For example, if you had lots of FAQ categories, you could make http://reddit.com/r/YOUR-SUB-REDDIT/wiki/FAQ/specs, http://reddit.com/r/YOUR-SUB-REDDIT/wiki/FAQ/personal and others. But, remember, these are quite hidden. Make sure to put them somewhere visible, such as the sidebar or Twitch panels, so people can see them.  
  
  
**Steam Groups**  
Twitch is mostly a gaming site, therefore making a steam group can be the perfect place for other gaming viewers to interact with you and your community. They offer a range of features - including events, announcements, discussions and more.  
  
  
First, you need to create your group by going to [this page](http://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate). You can then fill in the details there, [example](http://i.imgur.com/rB8Wtrd.png). You will then be brought to the [settings page](http://i.imgur.com/lLESNxm.png).You can then edit the group permissions (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GROUP-NAME/permissionsEdit), I recommend [these settings](http://i.imgur.com/7S9ugbh.png). To add moderators and officers, go to http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GROUP-NAME/membersManage and click the star next to a user's name.  
  
  
To create an announcement, go to http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GROUP-NAME/announcements/create and fill in the fields. Make sure to give it an interesting title.  
Discussions are made on the 'Discussions' tab by clicking the blue button on the right.  
To create an event, have a look at [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Mmw2JUz.png) and go to the URL shown at the top.  
With Steam, you can also create game recommendations under the 'Curator' tab.  
  
  
**Other Tips**  
These apply to all the ones above:  

- Include them on your Twitch page, so people see them. (Edit: Don't squash them all together in one panel).
- Keep them being used, you can automatically post when you are live in your Twitch settings.
- Link them into each other, make sure they are noticed.  
- Don't keep content stream related, talk about other things too.
- Interact with followers.

3deyxc,I had my first real viewer!,"So after a bunch of attempts to stream, having no one really view or talk in chat, I stopped trying for a bit.

Today I wanted to play Elite: Dangerous, so I figured ""Hey, I may as well try to stream it"". Set it all up, played for a bit, and then someone actually talked in chat. Saw I was new to the game, gave me a bit of advice and talked a bit. I ended up streaming for a couple of hours, with a few viewers filtering in and out, but this guy stuck around, so I was always at at least 1 viewer, made me feel pretty good.

And I got 3 new followers.

3d0piv,"Donations chargeback, paypal ignores me, need help please","Hello

My name is Damien Diviš, on internet im under nickname DeeThane. 

05/31/2015 08:43 PM 
06/01/2015 08:12 PM
In those two days, I was streaming on my channel twitch.tv/deethane. 
One random guy from stream sent me 31 donations (it was 6000 czech crowns, approximately 250$). He sent it in 31 donations, bigger, smaller. I told him few times, that I hope, that he will not miss the money, that he is sending me. After 20 days, he chargebacked the money. He submitted, that I was selling stuff to him, he payed for it and I didnt send goods. 

As you may know, paypal decided to put money on hold and I had to explain what happened with proofs. I wrote them, that I wasnt selling anything, that Im streamer and he sent me donations on his free state of mind. I also wrote there, that watching stream is something, that he could do for free. 

I tried to find him, I found him, found out it is some 14 year old kid and he told me, that he doesnt know about any chargebacks, or anything, then he ignored me.

I also wrote there very IMPROTANT STATEMENT, that I dont care, if he gets his money back, even tho, its unfair and his statement was I was selling goods, which is not true.

I added something like 10 screenshots, from stream, from twitch alerts, from paypal, I also wrote them, that I can give them VOD of donations being received. 
I lost all the cases and all the chargebacks went into his favour. And there is, where the problem starts.


FOR EVERY SINGLE DONATION HE CHARGEBACK, I HAVE TO PAY FEE 400 CZECH CROWNS = 15$.
I HAVE TO PAY ALMOST 460$ RIGHT NOW, JUST FOR FEES FOR THE FALSE CHARGEBACK.

I called to paypal support like 7th times. From 7 calls, there was one guy, that told me, he will help me. He told me, he will call chargeback team immediately after the call ends and explain them, that it is unfair. 

Three days, nothing. Right now, Im -500$ on my Paypal account, just because of the fees. I feel like its stupid, that Ill have to pay fees, for something I didnt even make. 

What else am I supposed to do? Get a lawyer? 500$ is a lot of money which I cant afford to loose. I feel like no one from paypal read my statement, or didnt understand it, that I wasnt selling anything, but it was donations to stream. Is there someone who can I contact? Some adress where should I write (maybe adress twitch partnership itself)...Im desperate guys, what am I supposed to do? :(

3cvx5f,6 Months of Streaming - A Review + Lessons Learned,"Hey everyone, I recently crossed 6 months of streaming right around the same time I passed over 1000 followers. I know I always enjoy reading progress reports and different experiences people have had so I figured I would share mine as well. Hopefully you can find some things that may help you along the way or at least you can find it interesting to read.

&amp;nbsp;

## **BACKGROUND**
I used to cast Starcraft 2 matches. I was never a very popular caster but I was able to cast a lot of small stuff and a couple of paid events. The largest crowd I ever casted for was around 10-11K on one of the streams for LoneStar Clash 2. After college I got a job and quit casting for a couple of years, so I essentially was starting over with streaming when I picked it up again. I rarely used to stream anyways before and I think the max viewers I ever had on my personal channel was around 10.

&amp;nbsp;

## **STARTING OVER**
One day I was browsing Twitch when I found siglemic speedrunning Mario 64. I thought it was just the coolest thing ever and hung out there for a while, just watching and enjoying the stream. After a while I found more and more speedrunning streams and I always thought they looked fun but I never owned any of the games or had any interest in really speedrunning them. Then one day, I came across a streamer named Nightfallx who was speedrunning Diablo 2. I have played D2 off and on since it came out 15 years ago and I thought to myself, ""Ya know what, I love this game and I could probably be pretty good at speedrunning it."" I watched him run a 1:41 with the Sorceress to set the WR and knew that I could probably run pretty close to it. I've played Diablo for so long, how hard could it really be? I decided I could stream it as well and off we went.

&amp;nbsp;

## **DAY ONE**
Due to streaming previously, I already had a general sense of how to setup OBS and make a generic layout and what not. I believe for this case I simply added chat, webcam, timer, and game. Pretty basic but it got the job done. I had studied the sorceress and taken a lot of notes so running sub 2 hours was gonna be great! 4:18:23 later, I finally finished my Sorceress in front of about 5-6 viewers. This was going to be harder than I thought.

&amp;nbsp;

## **FEBRUARY**
Over the course of the month I continued streaming pretty consistently. I work 8-6 so when I got home about 3-4 random days a week I would fire up the stream and speedrun a bit. It was in this month that I really started to notice a few key things:

1. Having a schedule really is important. There are people who started showing up to my stream and actually watched my stream as if it was a TV show they were waiting for to come on. 
2. I am ruler of the stream and I choose what tone I want to be set in my stream. I try to keep cursing down, try to be more relaxed, and try to just be nice overall. This carries over to my viewers and they seem to almost mirror my tone. I had always been scared that my stream would look like Arteezy's stream or some of the other streams where everyone is constantly cursing, spamming, etc. With the power of the timeout/ban hammer and even just a nice, ""hey let's not talk like that"" I could very quickly gain control of the stream.
3. Try not to be disappointed with viewer numbers. I know at this point I was watching it like a hawk and some days I could get 8-15, but other days there were points that I wasn't sure if anyone was watching. I knew if I wanted to increase this number I would have to take steps myself.

&amp;nbsp;

## **MARCH**
In this month I really started putting a focus on improving my stream, which I have kept since. I created new layouts and talked with other D2 speedrunners in the community, which helped get me a few friends to play with sometime and improved my learning of the game. I found that streams where I was speedrunning did better than streams where I was just playing through the game normally, and I also recognized just how wonderful it was to be playing a game like Diablo 2 when it came to streaming. Trying to stream a game like Dota 2, Starcraft 2, CS:GO, etc leaves you so BURIED that you're not going to draw many eyes at all. Diablo 2: LOD on the other hand has maybe 4-7 streamers on average and besides when one of the other speedrunners was running, most of the time you could be top stream with about 20 viewers. Not only that, but a lot of the streams were not very professional (lower quality, no webcam, not much talking, no layout) so by improving my stream I was able to very quickly outshine their streams and have a much prettier thumbnail. All of this of course led to increased viewership and follower numbers for me at a rate faster than most in the D2 category. I started averaging around 20-30 viewers a stream and could peak between 50-60!

Sorceress time: **2:05:00**

&amp;nbsp;

## **APRIL**
April was a lot of the same stuff, but I started experimenting with longer streams and let me tell you, they are WORTH it. It truly is amazing just how much better a long stream can be than a short stream, though much more tolling. I remember having a single weekend where I did two streams, one at 8 hours one at 12 hours, and between the two streams I gained about 80 followers and hit over 100 viewers on each one. I'm still not 100% sure how this happens, but I think it may just have to do with longer hours = more viewers accumulate = more exposure = more followers. These long stream numbers have continued through to today and honestly I wish I had more free time to do them because of how successful they are. I can go for a week of 3-4 hour streams and gain half the followers that I gain in one 10 hour stream.


Sorceress time: **1:48:00**

Time broadcasted: **89 hours**

Follows: **152**

Time Watched: **2848 hours**

&amp;nbsp;

## **MAY**
By May I started focusing on stream storyline. I took over the Llama identity and wrote up a little bio about how I was a Llama farmer who was forced to fight an evil AI kingdom after they stole my Llamas. Additionally, I started changing my follower notification to welcome them to ""Llama Army"" and created yet another layout, this time using a greenscreen I had purchased for about $20. I added a bot to start giving out loyalty points (Even though I didn't have a great use for them yet) and found a lot of viewers loved seeing that number grow. Whenever I started streaming, I instantly was the #1 Diablo 2 streamer and of course on Twitch being in that first spot is always a good place to be. Now that my follower count was higher, I began experimenting with some Dota 2 but after a couple of streams it truly was just a bust. An average D2 stream would be around 50 viewers, but playing Dota 2 I could barely get over 10 and that of course isn't close enough to the top where it drew any new viewers in. Being the biggest fish in a small pond did a lot more for me than being a small fish in the ocean. I also was able to peak over 100 viewers a couple of times, getting all the way up to 150 at one point! 


Sorceress time: **1:37:59** - WR?! No...someone else bumped the top time down to 1:28 so I'm just the 2nd fastest now :(

Time broadcasted: **98 hours**

Follows: **304**

Time Watched: **5713 hours**

&amp;nbsp;

## **June**
I was only able to stream about half my usual hours in June and it definitely showed in my numbers, but I was still able to keep progressing forward when I did stream. Early in the month I had applied for Partnership but was rejected with the generic email. I tried to email back asking what they were looking for from a smaller game streamer (Since nobody streaming D2 ever consistently brings in hundreds of viewers) but never received a response. I figured I'd just leave it alone for a while and apply again sometime in the future when I was consistently triple digits, instead of that happening only on a weekend stream. I had started speedrunning a few other characters this month and was actually able to snag the Barbarian speedrun WR. Lastly, I believe it was in this month that I added a costume to some of my streams, buying Chainmail online. This of course was to go along with the ""llama farmer now knight"" story and honestly it got a great response. I only wear it sometimes (due to it weighing 30 lbs and being tough to sit in for long periods of time), but when I don't have it on people ask where it is which is a good thing in my eyes because it means they enjoy it.

Sorceress time: **1:37:59**

Time Watched: **2304 hours**

&amp;nbsp;

## **July**
which brings us to July and my stream today! I've noticed that my viewership numbers grow a lot faster when I first login. It used to take a while to reach 30-40 viewers, but that seems to be more of a base that joins immediately and then grows from there. I also had been streaming on a mediocre 7 year old computer that lagged a lot when playing/streaming, so I finally decided to upgrade that to a beastly machine that should hopefully have no issues in the future. This was one more of my ""improve my stream"" goals that I had decided was finally time to implement. I ran a 10.5 hour hell Paladin speedrun as my 1000 followers goal and my viewers liked it so much they are already trying to come up with a 1500 goal for me. I think having that excitement from them is just one of the best possible things for a stream.

Sorceress time: **1:36:14**

Time broadcasted: **36 hours**

Follows: **77**

Time Watched: **2088 hours**

&amp;nbsp;

## **FUTURE IDEAS**

As I said before, I always want to be improving the stream and so I'm looking at ways to make it better. My current goals look like:

1. Start to get active on twitter. I honestly have used 0 social media thus far and never thought it was really necessary, but now that I actually connect more with my viewers I think it is only appropriate to have a great place like Twitter to continue furthering those connections beyond just when I'm streaming. I don't really care to use it as a tool for trying to promote a bunch, but I do think it is quite valuable for building relationships and keeping current viewers connected.
2. I really really want to make a youtube video about a llama farmer turned knight. I think my story is decently funny and I believe having an introduction video/video about the story would be a great way to bring in more people, as well as simply entertain those who watch the stream already.
3. I have yet to do any giveaways, but I think it would be fun to giveaway small things like bags of Starburst Jellybeans (so good) to just the current viewers watching. Nothing really advertised, but a great ""thanks for hanging out"" surprise.
4. Find those additional games and find a way to get into their viewers. As much as I love D2 and will continue to play it as my base, the viewership base is only so large. Expanding seems like a good idea, but it has to be done right.

&amp;nbsp;

## **FINAL ADDITIONAL TIPS**

1. Remember things about your chat members and actually care about their lives. Nothing is a better feeling than walking into a chat with 150 people, making a comment about it being too hot, and have a streamer remember that you live in Texas and know why it's extra hot for you.
2. People like alerts. They like to see their name pop up when they follow, donate, subscribe, etc. The more fun you make this, the better chance they'll want to join. I've very clearly had people hold off on donating because the stream was ending and they wanted to donate the next time when it was up again.

&amp;nbsp;

That's all I can think of right now. It's been a great 6 months, here's to 6 more!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3cvx5f/6_months_of_streaming_a_review_lessons_learned/,1436593136.0,61,0.93,36,Twitch,MrLlamaSC
3cqplx,"Hi, I'm Jokosmash from StreamPro.io. How can we make it easier to create your Twitch stream overlays?","Hey everyone,

Myself and 2 buddies have spent the last 3 months creating a free tool for Twitch streamers, and we could really use some feedback from you guys to make it better.

We're calling the tool [StreamPro](https://streampro.io) and it's an all-in-one editor for Twitch stream overlays. We basically wanted to create a poor man's Photoshop for creating and editing your Twitch overlays.

If you've ever tried to set things up like overlay graphics, Twitch alerts for donations, follower chains, or subscriber counters, you've probably had to dig through 2 year-old Reddit and OBS posts and other hacky guides. It was a really ugly process to me, and I didn't understand why there wasn't a better way.

So what we did was take the most used features that are currently being provided by tools like StreamTip, TwitchAlerts, or TNotifier and combined them into one easy drag and drop editor. You can add as many features to your Twitch stream in one single overlay. This means you don't have to add tons of layers inside of OBS.

If you check it out at [www.streampro.io](https://streampro.io) , I hope it's apparent how much time we've spent on it. But none of that means anything if you guys don't find it useful. I would be hugely thankful for any feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I'll respond to all of them.

Thanks everyone.

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for your huge support. I'll continue to answer questions here for as long as you continue to post them. You can also tweet us at [@StreamProIO](http://twitter.com/streamproio) with any questions.**

3clbpy,Performing for an Empty Room,"**Nobody wants to perform for an audience of none. On Twitch it's the precise thing you have to do to attract attention.**

There are a lot of key concepts to attracting an audience, networking, playing the right game at the right time, even getting a little lucky.

Performing for an empty room is a really difficult ""skill"" to develop. I never feel like people have it inherently, it's something you have to learn. It's the antithesis of what you'd expect a performance to be. No audience!

Twitch is a different beast. The time you typically have to capture the attention of someone is minimal, people bounce channel to channel trying to settle, and if they come upon your channel during a lull, you've probably lost that person for good.

Practicing performing to an empty room is difficult, but I've devised a little list of key concepts that I'm going to try to follow..Hopefully they'll help some of you out too! 

*Disclaimer: I ain't popular. I do however, feel like I've been around for quite awhile and gathered enough information and advice from moderately successful to very successful streamers to put together a list like this ;)*

**0) Planning is important**

Take a moment to jot down interesting things you want to talk about or things that happened to you. Try NOT to look at your notes, but if you feel a lull, take a look and pick up a new topic of conversation.

**1) Do you have a great story? Don't be afraid to re-tell that story a few times, even in a single session.** 

You can preface it with ""Might have told this one..."" or something similar, but if you think it'll engage viewers don't be afraid to hit the rewind button and tell it again..Just don't go overboard!

**2) What you're doing right now is always the most fun and interesting thing. Period.**

This is one I struggle heavily with and a lot of others do I know, but you can't seem bored, annoyed, or otherwise disinterested with what is happening in front of you. If people are coming and honestly want to invest time watching, they're interested in the game or activity. You need to be interested too.

**3) Engage when you see someone engaging** 

Do whatever you can. Ask questions. Extrapolate. Joke. Do whatever you can to make that one person feel noticed and engaged. Get to know the person, they're a viewer and hopefully, a friend!

**4) Figure out if talking with friends helps or hurts your stream**

This is something I keep falling back into, hopping onto TS and playing with friends. When you're playing with friends, you're having a conversation. Conversations typically have lulls, where you're not talking, letting your friends talk, etc. During those times unless your friends are extremely entertaining, your stream isn't getting much. I keep telling myself I'm swearing this off, only to go back to it, even though I know it hurts my performance.

**5) Unless you're a professional gamer, don't be so dang serious** 

Another one of my personal problems, I'm a bit of a serious bidness gamer. Focusing too hard detracts from actually entertaining people. You get quiet, you get pensive, you may throw out comments about the game that are too on point or aggressive. Seeing someone annoyed is typically a signal to switch channels for me, unless it's performed with silly rages or something similar.

**6) Go big or go home!**

You're you, but you're performing for others. Be bigger than life! If you're making a hand motion REALLY MAKE THAT HAND MOTION! Own what you do..People will find that compelling and interesting.

**7) You're never going to please everyone, so don't try** 

You're gonna want people to like you and what you're doing, don't try to adapt when someone comes in and says that you need to do this or that. Perform your way.

**8) Look inward to evaluate how you're doing**

Make sure you're happy with your performance and look for ways you can improve it. If you do feel the need to seek outside assistance, get a single person that is going to be close and honest with you. Crowd feedback is good, but one person you trust will go a lot further in shaping your conduct for the better.


As I stated before, there are a ton of other things one can and should do to increase viewership and keep people hooked, this is just one aspect. These points are what I'm working on right now, so I figured I'd share out and get some feedback/hopefully help some folks out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3clbpy/performing_for_an_empty_room/,1436386562.0,99,0.96,27,Twitch,Failstar

3b4ffq,A plea to Twitch staff: Don't lock our channels away.,"(Tl;Dr at the bottom)

Hey /r/Twitch,    

As some of you probably know, I'm a Creative caster. I stream leather work and have done so for over 1½ year after I stumbled upon Cnotbusch streaming his sculpting in the League of Legends category.    

I streamed for 9 months with less than 300 followers, but one day I started working on some Hearthstone themed items and my viewer count picked up. First 20 viewers one day, then 50, then 250, and even 900+ one day.    

I had stumbled upon good exposure by streaming in Hearthstone and lots of people tuned in, interested in my content. Within 2 months I had 4k+ followers and a partnership (Don't anyone dare say ""*You have to have boobs to get a partnership*"").    
This sudden success convinced me that my content had merit and that what had previously been a childish idea was actually possible. To live off of my streaming - Though it would obviously still be a long road and a lot of work ahead in order to actually reach that goal.    
My content had merit though and I even got some recognition by getting big hosts from people such as Massan, EXP and MissCoookies. It's been a year since that boom and I have my 1 year partner anniversary July 16th.    

Some may be wondering ""Is crafting allowed on Twitch? Isn't it games only?"" - A lot of people tuned in and asked me that same question, and I asked Cnotbusch as well when I first saw his channel. The answer was back then: Yes, but it has to be game related.    
It turns out quite a few people stream art and crafting on Twitch and have been allowed to do so by keeping it game related and streaming under the categories that their work was related to.    

While we were doing this, there were also a lot of people who wanted to stream their art but weren't able to because they didn't do anything related to games, so we (A group of art streamers) started talking with Kush about having a category dedicated to creative streaming. After a few months we got it, although it was unofficial (Still is), had no category art (Still doesn't), and no promotion or announcement behind it (Still doesn't). It was great though.    
We slowly saw people moving into Creative and setting up shop - It was a small category and there wasn't much going on, but it was a start. Meanwhile Cnotbusch, MissCoookiez and I - The 3 biggest Creative streamers at the time I believe, kept streaming outside of Creative.    

In my case I had yet to be able to live off of my stream and needed to grow my channel (Still do), and I also knew that my channel wasn't big enough to make Creative a big category on it's own, so I kept focusing on my growth and streaming in game categories and doing projects that were for the most part gaming related - Occasionally streaming in Creative.    

Creative grew and we started seeing big streamers such as Dodger and GiantWaffle in there and that helped create awareness of the category (Fucking thank you!). 
However, even though some channels have grown to a nice 4-6k follower size and gotten partnerships it's still not possible to grow your channel to a point where you can live off of the streaming - And for bigger channels such as MissCoookies there's little to gain there unfortunately - There's simply not enough traffic and exposure to reach the viewer and subscriber counts to earn enough to pay your rent.    

If you go to Creative and look now (EU night time/US daytime) you'll see a category that looks healthy, but don't be fooled. The viewers there are brought in by the individual streamers. Once the big streamers leave the category is dead with a browsing audience of maybe 50 people total (It's a dead category during EU daytime when I stream)    

There are many game categories that are like this on Twitch and that's nothing bad. But it is for us - Us who want to live off of streaming art.     

Even though our content is fairly popular and we're for the most part greeted with joy and surprise that we're allowed to stream, recently we who stream creative content outside of Creative have been getting emails from some staff members telling us that we are no longer allowed to stream any art whatsoever outside Creative, despite previously being allowed to do so.    

At first it was me who received an email and I started getting moved into Creative several times a day (Never been an issue before). It happened the same time Witcher 3 had just come out. I was crafting Geralt's shoulder armour and Mankej_ (A sculptor) was sculpting some Witcher 3 stuff in the same category. This was great - Thousands of people tuned in, and I personally gained 2k+ followers in 2 days of streaming. Mankej_ even got a shoutout on the official Twitch twitter account. But at the same time I got this email that told me I couldn't stream outside creative anymore regardless of my content - I might even be banned. Nothing happened, I believed it to be the staff's personal opinion and not the policy of Twitch - And I haven't been banned yet.    
But now others have started getting these emails from different staff as well.     

We've been told that we're not following the guidelines - But *there are no guidelines to be found*. There's nowhere we can be referred to and read the rules we're breaking because *Creative isn't officially acknowledged by Twitch yet and it has no guidelines* - Unlike for example Music which has fleshed out, readily available guidelines about what content should be where. To me this would be the same as confining all talk shows to Gaming Talk Shows - Which would be silly because a SC2 only talkshow would obviously find it's audience in Starcraft 2 - And so goes for LoL talkshows etc. - When I stream hearthstone themed content, my audience is in the hearthstone category, not Creative.    
I quite frankly panicked when this started happening because I know that if I'm locked inside Creative it will slow my growth to a crawl and be the death of my goal to live off of my streaming.    
I've sent emails and not gotten anywhere - I've been told something is happening behind the scenes, but we know nothing. No one is talking to us.    

I'd like staff to gather the long-time creative streamers and bring them into the conversation about creative streaming on Twitch - Because we're the ones who knows what works and what doesn't. What people like and what they don't like. In some cases people have been streaming their art for years already. Talk to us - We're just as serious about this as you are. If not more (Because we're the ones this affect the most).    

If we're locked inside of Creative our growth will stagnate and any chance of living off of streaming will either die or be set back several years.    

Creative is a great category and there are tons of wonderful people and fantastic art and there's no doubt it'll become an established community, if it isn't already. But please don't confine us to a single category. There's no good reason to do so.    

Thank you.

Tl;Dr: Some of us who stream art and crafting have started being told by certain staff to stream inside a single category only, regardless of content. In the past we've been allowed to stream in any category our content was related to. Being confined to a single category with little traffic and viewership will kill off any chance of growing and living off of streaming in the long run. Please don't.

EDIT: I'm quite certain, as I've been told, that Twitch **is** working on something, but it's probably not a priority. What I'd wish is that they don't start to change things before they're ready to roll out whatever they have planned.

3ayshu,"PSA: If you have a website/own a domain name, Your privacy is at stake!","A disturbing policy change is being discussed by the governing body for domain names, ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

ICANN has filed a proposal which, if approved by its members, will do away with hidden registration details for domain names.

What does this mean to Twitch broadcasters? Well, if you promote yourself via a website, and own a domain name (any domain name), it will be no longer be possible to protect your personal information from anybody who is familiar with a ""whois"" search.
Most registrars offer service to mask your information- if somebody performs a Whois search, the information returned will be generic and not your own. If this proposal passes, Domain registrations will no longer be allowed to mask their customers details, leaving you completely unprotected. 

This obviously has huge ramifications, but specifically for Twitch broadcasters the concerns should be obvious to all streamers from those who pull in 40,000 viewers a day to those who pull in 4. 

I urge anybody who has any concerns around their privacy to check out http://www.savedomainprivacy.org/whats-changing/ 

and if so inclined sign the petition: http://www.savedomainprivacy.org/sign-the-petition/ 

 and send an email here: https://www.respectourprivacy.com/ (thanks u/BoomLiam)

or submit a comment directly to ICANN https://www.icann.org/public-comments/ppsai-initial-2015-05-05-en

**edit 1: Just to be clear, the sole reason for this change is to pander to large companies to make it easier to carry out their copyright complaints!**

**edit 2: Important Point made by u/angry_intestines**
&gt; For what it's worth, ICANN only has jurisdiction over .com, .net, .org and I believe government TLDs, so if you want, you can create a ccTLD like .us or .se, etc and ICANN can't pursue it,but don't think of this as a pander to big corporations. It's part of it, but not all of it.
 

P.S.:, if you currently own a domain and do not use a proxy or privacy service, it might be worth looking into that

P.P.S: If you own a domain and are freaked out, check with your “Registrar”. Different  extensions have different policies around this, e.g. a whois for .com domains reveal all your information (including home address, phone number etc.) while many country codes like .ie for example will only reveal a name.


**tl;dr : ICANN want to make sure that all your viewers have access to your home address and phone number, make sure you tell them that’s not acceptable.**

3agmzp,PSA: Intro posts are now retired! Click to find out what we plan to do...,"Happy Friday, folks!

[Yesterday we posted a poll on whether or not we should do away with the introduction posts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3ac2sb/community_poll_is_it_time_to_finally_retire_intro/) The final tally was 88 points in favour of removing them, and 15 points in favour of keeping them (bear in mind people essentially had two votes if they decided to downvote the one they didn't like as well). 

So starting tonight we will no longer allow introduction posts. We will NOT remove any intro posts prior to 11:59pm UK Time tonight. This is so the TwitchDB can still function with the grandfathered links to old intros. All future intros will be created and stored entirely in http://Twitchdb.tv. The only thing that will be different is a Reddit thread will not need to be made. Everything will be on TwitchDB instead.

If you are looking for further ways to promote your channel, do consider submitting a recent highlight from your channel to our bi-weekly highlight contest! We WILL be changing one thing about that...we will add your twitchdb intro/bio to the post if you win! That means not only does the highlight winner get featured with a link to their winning content in the sidebar, they also get a full post stickied to the top of the subreddit that shows off their intro as well! :D (but we can't show off your intro if you haven't made one in the db, so get writing!).

REMEMBER THESE FEATURES ABOUT TWITCHDB AND WHY YOU STILL SHOULD SUBMIT YOUR INTRO THERE:

- You can create your introduction/stream bio there in order to receive your official broadcaster flair here on /r/Twitch. [Click here to create one!](http://www.twitchdb.tv/createintro)

- You can search the database and view the front page with fully randomized streams featured on it, all pulled only from the database. [Click here to search through the database.](http://www.twitchdb.tv/streams)

- SOON™, the feedback feature will return that provides you with a feedback link that you can put in your chatbot, in your Twitch info area, or anywhere else and suggest people click it so they can provide you with totally anonymous channel feedback and advice on how to improve your content. You just log in to twitchdb and your feedback will be available on your dashboard!

YOUR IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS:

- We really truly appreciate all the ideas and feedback you guys gave in the voting post! The team is taking all the info on board and will experimenting making different things to see what works. I understand the vast majority of you suggested a once-a-week intro digest post, however this is time-prohibitive in terms of manual compiling, so we will see what we can do!

- As for your suggestions on better functionality for twitchdb, all of that is already planned and in the pipeline! Our one-man coding slave is hard at work already for our benefit! Thanks /u/Distortednet!

Thanks everyone for your help on this!

3af1c4,What Applying for Partnership is Really Like,"In the spirit of the new guide that was posted 'tips for partnership' on the Twitch support website, I decided I'd draft a list of my own tips for partnership. These tips are based off of the information I've gleaned from the guide, from the application requirements, and from secret voodoo magic.  
  
**Tips For Partnership**  
  
- You generally want to have as many as 500 viewers, although 100 viewers will usually work too, unless you applied on a Friday in which case 50 viewers will do. However if you accidentally applied on Saturday, the minimum will be 200+.  
  
- The requirements aren't actually requirements; they're guidelines. The guidelines aren't actually guidelines, they're tips.  
  
- You may be tested by a Twitch-supported samurai at your current place of residence if you have applied for the partnership program recently. If you defeat him, you will become his sensei, and after a brief training montage you will be granted partnership, but only if there is a full moon in the sky at night, otherwise there's only a 50% chance.  
  
- Try to have the best and most unique content on Twitch. We're not really sure what we mean by that, and we're not going to explain our metrics to you.  
  
- If you've been denied partnership five or more times, you may want to perform an ancient cleansing ritual, for which you will need one cow, two cats, and a jar of tree sap. For more information please visit [ LINK REDACTED ]  
  
- We said 500 viewers will get you partnered or maybe just 100 but we need to re-iterate we're not really sure. Seriously, we're really not sure.  
  
- Occasionally you may see someone in your chat named red_ninjakity_desu_69. If you see this person it is imperative that you ban him immediately. This has nothing to do with partnership, but just bear it in mind.  
  
This is not an exhaustive list, but this concludes what I've learned from the tips for achieving partnership &amp; apply-for-partner requirements list.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Jokes aside, the 'requirements' for partnership are very, very cryptic. I'm not going to complain about what I think I do or don't deserve - or what others do or don't, for that matter - but what I'm trying to say is I have no idea what the actual 'requirements' are, and I'm not sure that the partnership staff really does either.  
  
I personally have applied a fair numbers of times as a variety caster with an average of 50-100+ viewers during every cast. Once we're denied we can speculate as to why, but with little more than generic denial emails, these 'tips' really don't do all that much to help. It'd be great if we could get real, helpful responses to help us improve our casts in the way that the partnership team wants us to.  
  
Please don't take this post as a personal assault. It is meant as a harmless - but meaningful, I think - joke, and a vent for my (and others') frustrations.  
  
**Edit:** Added a (fairly lengthy) response of my own. Read if you wish. That is all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/3af1c4/what_applying_for_partnership_is_really_like/,1434731322.0,92,0.89,85,Twitch,rallei_lol
3ac2sb,COMMUNITY POLL: Is it time to finally retire Intro posts on the sub (and use the twitchdb only)?,"Myself and the rest of the mods have been having this discussion off and on since we revamped the subreddit three weeks ago. We saw a massive boom in an already sizable amount of introductions and it's not really declining. We have always felt it nice that each person in this community get one opportunity each to promote their channel and explain why their content is worth watching, however we can see that not only are there 20+ intro posts a day now, they also seem to be down-voted most of the time. 

We do have the http://www.twitchdb.tv/createintro, our new intro database that not only formats the introduction posts in a readable manner but stores the information for browsing by the public, allows for flair recognition on the subreddit, and allows for specific channel feedback via a shareable link. The potential downside to using only the database is that intros would no longer be shared here in the subreddit directly. They could only be found via a database search/library link I could make and put in the sidebar. 

So folks, it's time to decide if we should do away with introduction posts overall. Please vote via this strawpoll link: [redacted]

If you select to keep the intro posts, please PLEASE post a reply here with any suggestions you have on how to lower the intro-spam without removing them entirely.

&gt;Whisper to friends, followers, and subscribers to chat privately one-on-one across all of Twitch. Your whisper will show up in-line with the rest of chat on web and mobile apps no matter what channel you’re on. If you’re watching Lirik and your friend is watching MANvsGAME, you can still whisper to him/her as long as you are both online. But only you and the user you’re whispering to will be able to see the conversation.

39aqwc,"""Why Am I Not Growing On Twitch?"" I Will Tell You Why","This does not apply to anyone who actually reads this sub reddit. They already know what I am about to say. 

What game are you streaming? If you say League of Legends, Dota2, Minecraft, Counter Strike, Diablo 3, Destiny, or Hearthstone, that is why you are not growing. Plain and simple. 

99% of all posts that complain about slow or little growth on twitch, ALWAYS PLAY THOSE GAMES. STOP! Do you hear me? Stop playing those games, pick a different game. If you insist on playing those games, then don't post on twitch about how you are not growing. 

Do you want to talk about your growth, and you don't play those very saturated games? That is great. Please post about that. 

Mods, please create a sticky post that says something like this. At least the community can start pointing people to it in order to stop all these growth posts. These growth posts might get worse in the summer with all the new streamers starting out. 

My intention is not to come off mean or rude. I love this twitch sub reddit. I love this community. If you need help, let me know. Maybe I can give you some sort of help. I could maybe look over your channel, give you some tips. I am in no way a big time streamer, but my growth is....uh....growing?

396arp,My mod is getting way too invested in me. I don't suppose there's any way to get him to back off amicably?,"Alright, the background. I started streaming a dungeon crawler two weeks ago, and I have about 150 followers. One person showed up pretty consistently and I modded him to shut down sexual harrassment on my stream. He does (did) a great job and really improved the quality of chat. I also have a few other mods who are okay but not consistent - no prob it's their prerogative. 

He suggested we add each other's in-game information so he can message me privately about mod stuff. Okay, made sense. A few days later he asked me for help with an in-game thing. Yeah, of course, he's done a lot for me I can definitely help him out. He ended up being pretty terrible, so I made a mental note not to play with him during stream because babysitting him totally fucks up the pacing and is really boring.

I ended up finding out, however, that he bought an expansion specifically to play with me. And he saved up his last pay check to buy a microphone so we can one day skype. But, I don't want to skype with him. I don't know who he is. He's not fun to play with, and I am extremely uncomfortable with him buying things in order to hang out with me. I don't have an issue with helping him out once in a while but this really took me by surprise.

Anybody ever deal with this? How do you set boundaries with your followers/mods? How do you politely get people to back off? I feel really naive. On the plus side as far as I can tell, for the time being my personal information is completely severed from my twitch account so I've got that going from me.

Edit: You guys are bummin me out :p alright I'm just going to be direct and tell him thanks for his time but I'm only going to play with my IRL friends in-game unless I'm hosting a stream specific event. That'll probably upset him, but we can't be friends with everybody I guess.

391rrl,Why I prefer watching streamers that aren't mainstream.,"Look, everyone has their favorite streamers.. I mean you got like Lirik and Poppin and those guys who are pros. But I personally do enjoy watching them but really prefer watching up and coming or non mainstream streamers.. I really think the interaction is just so more superb. With those mainstream guys the chat is so spammed it stupid so, you cant interact and they force you to donate to ask the streamer a question.. With the up and comers you really can interact with them and they will talk to you, which IMHO is what twitch is all about..

38xith,Too scared to stream,"Hey future streamers! Just__Great here from http://JustGreatGFX.com. I've talked to many people unsure about streaming and that gave me an idea which led me to write this basic guide on how to overcome the fear of streaming for you. I know there's much more to the anxiety and stress before streaming than this guide covers, but hopefully this overview will help you take that first step. Take a moment to look over the guide and let's discuss this topic.

**Protect Your Privacy**

The most important fear is protecting yourself from danger. Real danger can happen if you share personal information online. There are some important steps to keep yourself out of trouble and give yourself peace of mind.

Do not use your real name. Use a fictitious name or alias for your social media and email accounts related to your stream. Additionally do not register your stream related email address with any other websites.

You should always keep your home address and phone number private. However if you must provide a mailing address, use a post office box instead. You can also keep the city you're living in private or even tell your viewers a different city or state entirely.

Do not click links in your stream. Just like you wouldn't download an unknown file from your email. You can't trust random links, no matter who sends them to you.

Using Skype and other VOIPs (voice over IP) aren't always secure. Be advised that your IP address may be found through use of such software.

Certain games can display your IP Address. Avoid playing those games on stream or take precautions such as using graphics to cover up personal information such as an IP address. Also, connect to official game servers when playing multiplayer games with multiple hosted servers. If you'd like to take even more precautions then you can use a VPN (virtual private network) that would show users a different IP even if they tried to obtain your IP.

**Evaluate Your Fear**

Take a moment and write down what makes you scared or fearful of streaming. Play out the scenario in your mind and continue with it. Allow yourself to keep thinking and ask yourself ""and then what happens?"". Sometimes our fears manifest because we haven't completed the thought. 

You may be fearful because of a poor self image. You're very critical of yourself and afraid others won't like you. The cure for this is to know yourself. Know your core values and what you believe in. Stream for yourself, because you want to and you want to share the experience with others. 

Do not fear success. You may think it will require more responsibility, but that's not the case. If you fear success then it's the fear of the unknown. Everyone fears the unknown and that's why it's important to complete the thought! Remember to ask yourself ""and then what happens?"".
**
Set Realistic Goals
**
Make small goals at first. You can always become more ambitious later. Your goal could be as simple as asking yourself ""I wonder what happens if I try…"" and insert the blank with a simple goal. Doing this will help you realistically figure out if something will work or not without the idea of failure since your goal was only to try.

**Setbacks and Mistakes**

Setbacks and mistakes can and will happen. We can't always control setbacks. We can however, prepare for setbacks, learn from them and plan for future setbacks. Mistakes will occur, but they don't have to discourage you. Everyone makes mistakes, we learn from our mistakes. Also, ask yourself ""is this truly a mistake or just a different way of doing things?"". There's more than one way to accomplish a task and beating yourself up for believing you made a mistake is a wasted effort.

Ask for help! Everyone needs support. Not everything has to be hard mode. If you keep trying to do everything yourself you'll burn out sooner or later. Talk to your friends and family about your interests. If they aren't very supportive, keep searching! You're never alone. You can always find someone to assist you.


**Stream For The Right Reasons**

Do it because you love sharing your gaming with others. Do it for yourself and because you want to. Don't do it to impress others or become famous. Chances are very low to become famous through solely streaming. Don't do it for making money. Yes, there are streamers who make money, but you're not going to make it big without hard work, dedication and spending your own money to make it happen.

It's also important to have a life outside your game. Don't get too caught up with streaming all the time. Viewers want your stream to be an experience. How can you give them an experience if you're not familiar with the world outside your room's walls?

**Relax and Just Do It**

Sometimes fear comes from treading in unknown territory. Sometimes the easiest way to overcome a fear is to just dive right in. So do it. Stream for 1 hour, 30 minutes or even just 10 minutes and see how it goes. You can't base your knowledge on something that you have no experience in. So get out there and take that step. Overcome your fear and fulfill your potential.

Edit: Wow thank you for the gold! I'm really glad this post was helpful to you!

38ot97,THE BIGGEST UPDATE TO /R/TWITCH EVER!!! OH YES. WE DID A THING.,"~read me for a full tour on how Twitch and the community want to help YOU~

Hey everyone!

We’re at nearly 33k subs! Thanks so much to everyone spreading the word and contributing to this place!

I am super proud to announce we have launched a **massive overhaul** to /r/Twitch as of today! This has been a project in the works for the past month or so, and relied on many people to make it a success. I apologize for the length of this post, I know, it’s NUTS. But **IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS SUBREDDIT CAN HELP YOU IN MANY MANY WAYS** then it’s worth reading my complete and clear walkthrough on all our new features and tools available!

* **Completely new look with all new art and design!** Thanks SO much to /u/Truthful for his efforts! To give you an idea on how far we’ve come, [check out what the sub looked like over a year ago, to see how far we've come for style and features!](http://web.archive.org/web/20131229052110/http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/)

* **TOTALLY NEW css code for the site!** We even cleaned behind our ears and picked out that belly-button lint! SHINY. This subreddit is now fully responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts to suit all different resolutions! The only issue that is so far not solvable is RES' dark mode that does not auto-invert the colours of the topic posts, but this is something they’d have to code, not us. Thanks so so SO much to our own /u/Distortednet for saving me from losing my mind redoing the code, and for his unending patience with all my nitpicking. &lt;3

*  **We have a new filter category called [Site Suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/search?q=flair%3Asitesuggestion&amp;restrict_sr=on)!** This was implemented a few weeks back, but it’s worth pointing out for Twitch staff and other 3rd party developers who like to find ways to improve the site! Simply click on the top-left dropdown menu and select the category you’d like to filter by!

* **The community tools dropdown menu has MOVED!** It is now split between awesome featured sites/tools/resources located in the sidebar, and the guides and other links are available now in the /r/Twitch Wiki! Oh yes...WE HAVE A WIKI NOW (more on that below)!

* **On the sidebar, there are some brand new features.** We’ve organized the sidebar by category. There are three categories full of very useful links:

1) **PROMOTE YOURSELF!** This category is filled with things to help you succeed as a streamer, including getting promoted here, on Twitch’s official channel, and cool links to get you networking!

* **Introduce Your Channel!** This is for your /r/Twitch channel introduction AND for getting/giving channel feedback! We know that while people still want a way of promoting themselves, our intro post system wasn’t exactly the best. So /u/Distortednet has built an entire website just for this to streamline the process and make it more engaging for those who wish to learn more about the broadcasters on our subreddit!

* **TO SUBMIT AN INTRO IF YOU HAVEN’T BEFORE:** [Login to the new database](http://twitchdb.tv/createintro) and follow the instructions. Double check to ensure proper submission by looking at your profile page in the site for a received status, (it should look [LIKE THIS](http://i.imgur.com/8GlwaAE.png)).

* **NOTE IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED AN INTRO:** Distorted has said we dropped from 1700 down to 300 intros total when he ported our existing database into his proper new one because it only counts submissions with proper formatting and sufficient links/info. So simply LOGIN and check your profile page for a received status (it should look [LIKE THIS](http://i.imgur.com/8GlwaAE.png)). If you do not have a received status, [send us a modmail and give us your Twitch name, and if at all possible a link to your intro you previously made](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTwitch&amp;subject=intro%20status).

* **IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE CHANNEL FEEDBACK BOTH FROM THIS SUBREDDIT AND YOUR VIEWERS**: an intro is actually not needed for this step, you simply just have to log in and copy the feedback url on your profile and then link it on your Twitch page (in your chat via a chatbot command, or as a link in your info area) and then login to the feedback page (http://www.twitchdb.tv/feedback/YOURNAMEHERE) every so often to read your feedback!

* **BONUS POINTS**: Once a month, I will run a giveaway for a $25 steam game of your choice based on channel feedback submissions. SO CHECK OUT YOUR FELLOW STREAMERS’ CHANNELS VIA THE DATABASE TO GIVE THEM SOME WELL-APPRECIATED FEEDBACK AND YOU COULD WIN!

* **Highlight Contest Submission!** Nothing has changed here...yet. Every two weeks, there is a new contest to submit your best recent highlight and try to win a spot in our highlight winners’ row at the top of the sidebar (which people can click on your avatar to watch your winning submission and maybe even drop you a follow &lt;3). We are still looking at ways to improve the highlight contest so if you have any suggestions, drop them in a comment below!

* **Get on TwitchWeekly!** A TOTALLY NEW FEATURE MADE BY TWITCH! The Video Spotlight is an opportunity for you to get seen by thousands of interested passionate viewers! Each week they play a video spotlight in an effort to bring broadcasters of any size exposure and grow their viewership. The videos are basically short advertisements about a broadcaster, what they play, what sort of broadcast they put on and anything else that they feel is pertinent. The videos they've gotten have helped several partners, non-partnered broadcasters and even small indie developers get a boost in channel growth. Submit a video using [the link in the sidebar](https://twitch.submittable.com/submit/41159) and good luck!

* **Network at TwitchCon!** This is a permanent link to the TwitchCon Roster post we made recently! Are you going to the convention? Post a reply with your channel name so the community knows! We’ll update this post to include schedules and approved panel announcements when they happen! As well, the roster at the bottom of the topic post will be updated every time @TwitchConSF and #TwitchWeekly announce new special guests so check it every so often for the latest in TwitchCon HYPU!

* **Get Branded!** Looking to get banners/avatar/logo/overlays/etc done for your channel OR are you an artist looking to advertise your talents? This is where you are free to run amok with creative collaboration and symbiotic glee! Please note that some artists may offer their services for free, and some may not.

* **Browse Twitch Teams!** This is a section of the wiki that is an evolving process where Twitch teams can submit a team page (complete with bio, event info, and application process) and where you can browse the roster of Teams, learn about the different communities on Twitch, and even apply to join one that you feel fits your channel! Here’s how to submit your team to our Twitch Team database!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/wiki/teams)
 
2) **GET SUPPORT** This section is an extensive list of sites and resources to help you in any situation related to Twitch!

* **Read Guides on our Wiki!**  We aim to make [this wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/wiki/index) the most comprehensive resource for the Twitch community, whether you’re a viewer, newer broadcaster, or experienced partner, there’s relevant info for you in here! There are already dozens of guides and tools available, and more will be added every week! **I HIGHLY suggest you browse through the index!** You’re bound to learn a thing or two, and maybe even become an approved submitter yourself! [Click here and learn how to become an approved submitter to the wiki!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/wiki/wiki_guide)

* **Tweet Twitch Support!** Have an issue you need solving asap? Tweet @TwitchSupport for a quick response from the awesome Admins and knowledgeable Twitter Volunteers that help out there, 24/7. Throw a follow on the account while you’re at it for up-to-the-minute information on site issues and fixes.

* **Give Feedback to Twitch!** A new tool that lets you easily give feedback for new ideas/improvements/site suggestions and upvote already existing suggestions (the more popular a suggestion is, the more likely it’ll get addressed). Also, staff actively respond to these and update their status to say if something is planned, already started, or rejected, so you’re not left wondering.

* **Search the Help Portal!** Check Twitch’s Help portal for common questions and issues answered by Twitch staff, as well as articles covering many aspects of Twitch.

* **TwitchTips (Unofficial)!** A cool unofficial blog run by Twitch Admin /u/Truthful with submissions from the community. Check it out and learn a thing or two!

* **Report a Bug on Twitch!** This is a direct link to reporting a bug on Twitch. See a technical issue with any part of the site? Fill out this quick lil form!

3) **OFFICIAL TWITCH STUFF** These are just your core official Twitch links to things you should follow to ensure you’re always up-to-date on Twitch stuff!

* **Official Twitch Channel!** Hit follow on the official Twitch channel! An awesome team of Twitch staff stream an hour-long news show every week, called Twitch Weekly, that goes over recent and upcoming stream events, game releases, and showcases unique talent on the site via the “Staff Picks”, “Partner Spotlight”, and “Video Spotlight” segments (submit your video through the “Get on Twitch Weekly” link in the sidebar to get featured)! They even answer YOUR questions when they have time, just tweet with the hashtag #TwitchWeekly or PM them via the channel! The channel is also used for special event coverage for PAX, E3, and many other conventions that Twitch have booth presence at!

* **Follow Twitch on Twitter!** Follow the official Twitch Twitter account for up-to-the-minute updates on stream events and announcements!

* **Official Twitch Blog!** Check out the official Twitch Blog, updated often with new, highly informative posts and announcements!

* **While the rules haven’t really changed, they are now all hovery and stuff.** OOOOOO science!

* **We created a new user flair called “Community Helper”!** User flair are the fashionable little icons next to your custom description on your username. Starting now, this new flair type will be offered to those who consistently and correctly answer question posts, tech support posts, and those who are approved to submit new pages to our wiki on this subreddit (we will PM you before adding incase you may not wish to change from your Broadcaster flair if you have that). Not only do we feel this new flair type will show appreciation to those who help so much, it will also be a recognizable sign to those asking the questions that a specific answer is likely the right answer. It’s also worth noting here that if you don’t yet have flair and you are a broadcaster on Twitch, [submit an intro to our fancy new database](http://twitchdb.tv/createintro) to get your Broadcaster flair!

* Message the Moderators is also not new, but I’d like to just point out that this is the proper way to request advertising anything in the subreddit, or submitting any issues or private questions to us! We typically respond within just a few hours!

Have any suggestions for how these changes can be improved even more or have an idea for something you don’t see on the sidebar that should get featured? Let us know in a comment below!

Thanks so much and we hope you enjoy all the new features!

38g6xb,Guide - How to crop webcam in shapes.,"Hello! I am a small and relatively new streamer from Argentina. I have been asked repeatedly about how I make my webcam the shape of a Heroes of the Storm character portrait (hexagon). Im whipping up a quick tutorial for those who want to crop their webcams in different shapes ♥ I'm not sure this works for all stream softwares but I reckon it should. I use OBS.

1. Download [this tiny program](http://imageoverlayutility.bitbucket.org/). It's called Image Overlay Utility and is useful for placing images on top of other programs. It obviously supports .png and you can alter the size of your image directly from it.
2. Make a photoshop .png image with an empty window the shape you want your webcam to be. Remember the rest of it should be a bright chroma color like fluo green, blue, pink, etc. [This is mine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mrqxqfx2vrbao6/chroma.png?dl=0) (hexagon shaped).
3. Open Image Overlay Utility and load your .png file.
4. Open your webcam software (not stream software) and place the window of the .png file you just opened on top of your webcam. [Like this](http://i.gyazo.com/afb431637838e917daaa054d55d76f57.png).
5. Use the Capture Monitor tool from OBS (sorry, I dont know about other stream softwares) to capture **that part** of the monitor (only Capture Monitor will work, obviously Capture Window won't). Pick the color of the part of the capture you want to remove with chroma so it disappears.

That's it! I've seen other tutorials but theyre all more complicated or need resources we small streamers cant afford.

I like this one best because I can still use my full camera area if i want (just use Capture Window on the webcam software).

[This is what my control monitor ends up looking like](http://imgur.com/cjXA2kI). I hope you find this useful ♥ Don't hesitate to show off your results.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/38g6xb/guide_how_to_crop_webcam_in_shapes/,1433377181.0,61,0.91,15,Twitch,monkeylibrium
388b7b,"Twitch bans for streaming Hatred are in violation of their own ToS, because users not e-mailed about change in policy. Bans illegal until the 26th of June, 2015.","[x-post] /u/article10ECHR
Interesing point: the rule change was made public on ""the official Twitch blog"" http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/05/rules-of-conduct-update-adult-oriented-games/

According to the Terms of Service (Last modified on 1/15/2015 http://www.twitch.tv/user/legal?page=terms_of_service or https://archive.is/Jvpji ), which supersede the Rules of Conduct, this qualifies as a ""notice"".

And notices have to be either sent by e-mail, in which case they apply within 24 hours of it being sent, or on the Twitch Service, in which case they apply only after 30 days (!). This would mean that in fact, no accounts can be banned or suspended for streaming Hatred until the 26th of June, 2015. In that case Twitch would be liable for the loss of revenue generated from all broadcasts on the banned channels.

    article 21 sub g Entire Agreement.

    The Terms of Service, together with the Terms of Sale, the Privacy Policy and the Guidance, is the entire agreement between you and Twitch relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed or otherwise agreed to by both parties, or by a change to these Terms of Service or Guidelines made by Twitch as set forth in Section 6 above.

    article 6 Modification of these Terms of Service.

    Twitch reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Service or to reflect changes in the law). If Twitch changes these Terms of Service, we will provide you notice of these changes, such as by sending an email, posting a notice on the Twitch Service or updating the ""Last Updated"" date above. Please check these Terms of Service and any Guidelines periodically for those changes. Your continued use of the Twitch Service after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. For any material changes to these Terms of Service, the amended terms will automatically be effective thirty days after they are initially posted on the Twitch Service unless you contact us to discuss any questions or comments during that time period. We will always make a reasonable effort to notify you if we do change these Terms of Service.


    article 21 Miscellaneous. Notice.

    Twitch may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to Twitch's terms and conditions, by email, regular mail or postings on the Twitch Service. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after email is sent, unless Twitch is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through the Twitch Service. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing. Notice posted on the Twitch Service is deemed given 30 days following the initial posting.""

TL;DR - So it's quite clear that the change, if it's effective at all, it will only be from the 26th of June, 2015 and onwards. This means that all bans, suspensions, and the 'memory holing' of Hatred streams/streamers on Twitch are in violation of Twitch's own ToS, and are therefore void. And it won't be effective even after the the 26th of June, 2015 if ""you contact [Twitch] to discuss any questions or comments during that time period"".

Article 21 sub h tells you exactly how to do that:

    [...] we encourage you contact us as soon as possible after you start using the Twitch Service at legal@twitch.tv since otherwise they will be binding on you after a reasonable time period (usually 30 days unless there are exceptional circumstances).

If you are already banned / suspended / memory-holed from the Search: As a first step I would contact Twitch Legal, and tell them:


Your ban (etc.) is void because you weren't notified of the policy change in accordance with articles 6 and 21 of the ToS, at least 30 days before being banned for violating the amended policy, and;
    You also wish to voice your disagreement with the change, pursuant to the latter part of article 6 TOS (because you contact them to comment on the amended terms they will not be automatically effective, even after the thirty days).
    Await their response. If the response is or isn't to your satisfaction, please reply to this post:

37xwqz,1 Month of streaming! My experience and what i learned.,"**This is my personal experience! What happened for me, may not necessarily happen to you.**

I starting streaming on the 1st of May. Like most, i did no advertising of any sort. The first day i ended up receiving 5 follows in the short 2 hours that i streamed. The next few days i streamed for 5 hours a day. It was tough and tiring but i pushed through it. Gained 100 followers the first week. 

The second week i changed the streaming scheduled to 8 hours a day. I started at 12pm PST. I noticed that 2pm PST were my peak times during the weekdays. however, on the weekends i noticed my peaks where at 6-8am PST. I gained 150 followers the second week. I asked my viewers why they watched and followed and almost everyone said it was because i interacted with everyone in the chat. My chat would get 1000+ messages a day. They also complimented my voice as being ""radio quality"". 

I adjusted my schedule for my third week to start right before those peak times. I kept the interactions high and always welcomed everyone back to the stream. At this point i was getting 30 viewers at my peak times. I don't play games right away, I put up a starting soon image first. Once i start playing games, around 10 people would already be in the lobby to watch.   I only play 4 games at this point. H1Z1, CSGO,Minecraft, Nazi Zombies. gained about 100.

The final week i didn't stick to my scheduled and missed days. The people who i had waited before were not there and i had less viewers during my peak times. After sticking to the scheduled for 2 days i had my normal number of viewers and more. Gained around 70 followers this final week. 

**What i learned**

Be consistent with the scheduled and games.

Do not have long waits were you are not actually playing the game. (lobbies, ETC)

Interact with the chat. The delay is no too bad, just try to respond as soon as you see the message. 

When you have enough people who don't mind what you stream, switching to a new game is very easy. The old viewers will help boost your stream to the top and be more visible for newer viewers. YOU WILL HAVE LESS VIEWERS THAN YOUR MAIN GAME! Don't be scared when you see a drop in viewers when you switch to a new game. Don't let it get your hopes down. Don't stop playing the game if you enjoy it!

Have fun! If you are seeing this as a job or a chore, reconsider what you are doing. When you are enjoying the game and streaming, it will show! figure out what makes your viewers happy, but most importantly what makes  YOU happy.


Please don't think this is the best advice someone can give. This is just what i went through and what i learned. This is my personal experience and this is what has helped me get the viewers and the followers. If you have any questions, please ask.

37kvvx,The Rule of Conduct update misses its goals,"[For reference.](http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/05/rules-of-conduct-update-adult-oriented-games/)

While there is already a lot of discussion going on in other places, I wanted to take the opportunity and take a stab at providing a more detailed piece of criticism.

From the official blog post:

&gt; Our goal at Twitch is to create a safe, welcoming, inclusive community platform where everyone can feel comfortable and have fun.

This statement implies that the RoC Update is supposed to further this goal of twitch being a ""safe, welcoming and inclusive platform"". It also implies that twitch is supposed to be a platform for everyone.

However, what about people who -among other things- are also interested in AO games? These people will hardly feel welcome on a platform which bans something they are interested in. In fact they are more likely to feel excluded. (Full disclosure: I am part of that group.)

Bottom line, this update harms the goal of being a welcoming platform for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Despite what I just said, I am not advocating for allowing people to stream whatever game they want without any caveats. Just as there is a group of people who are interested in AO games, there also is a group of people, who experience great discomfort when facing AO content.

Just as the desire for AO content should not be ignored, the desire to avoid said content should not be ignored. A platform for everyone has to find a way to accommodate both.

So while the update misses its mark, something has to be done to resolve the tension between those groups without ignoring any one of them.

&amp;nbsp;

In my eyes, the best solution to this problem is customizable content-filtering, where users can select what kind of content they don't want to see. This way, people can avoid what they want to avoid, while others can still see what they want to see.

This of course is not as easy to implement as a change in policy, but if twitch is supposed to truly become a platform for everyone, there is no easy way out.

&amp;nbsp;

The goal of being safe, inclusive and welcoming is a good one. The problem is, that the update hasn't put twitch any closer to it than before. Excluding one group in favor of another isn't a step forward, at best it is no step backwards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/37kvvx/the_rule_of_conduct_update_misses_its_goals/,1432811405.0,77,0.87,133,Twitch,Pseudoradius

36vnpz,'Camgirls' on Twitch,"***""Have something negative to say? Keep it constructive and proactive in nature.""***

I'm going to be working hard to avoid tripping the sensors on that one. 

I think it's time we had a discussion about some of the female streamers who are using their 'assets' to solicit donations from a specific younger male audience.

*Note: This isn't about gender shaming. There are tons of incredibly skilled and dedicated female streamers who focus on gaming and deserve viewers more than these 'cam girls'.* 


I honestly believe that Twitch enforcing their own rules about sexually suggestive content would be a huge benefit to the community as a whole. 

Less 'cam shows' and more legitimate gaming-focused streams will result in more ad revenue and donations for legitimate streamers, allowing for higher quality production values, more benefits for subscribers, giveaways, and in some cases actually allowing real gaming streamers to 'give up the day job' and focus on streaming full time (a pipe dream that many of us Twitch viewers/streamers share.)

These 'cam show' streams could also have a hugely negative impact on the perceived legitimacy of female gamers - it encourages the (fucking stupid) opinion that women can't compete with male gamer's streams and need to 'show boob' to get subs.

Finally, I know the problem doesn't just rest with the 'cam girl' streamers themselves, but also with the prepubescent teens that legitimize their actions with donations, and Twitch for not enforcing their own rules. 

Twitch has created an environment where it pays to be sexually suggestive (one prominent 'cam girl' has even unashamedly boasted about this on live stream chat with Twitch admins present), on a site that isn't age gated to prevent hormonal youngsters from being suckered in by their actions. With more and more brands 'sponsoring' streamers this could also lead to companies using these 'cam girls' to have their products endorsed to a younger male audience via streams.

I'm interested in hearing other peoples thoughts on the subject so we can have a nice open discussion. I'm not interested in listening to rants or witchhunts about specific streamers.

35zh3q,Reduced Stream Delay for All Broadcasters,"&gt;Beginning today, all broadcasters will have the option to reduce stream delay on their broadcasts via an on-off toggle in Settings. Enabling this feature reduces delay on average by 33%.

&gt;How have we reduced the delay? We’ve successfully cut the video segment size from four seconds to two seconds, which decreases the amount of video that is stored in the processing pipeline. If you’re a broadcaster who spends a lot of time interacting with chat, this new reduced delay option means you’ll spend less time waiting for replies.


&gt;You can enable this option at any time, but it must be turned on prior to the start of your broadcast to take effect.

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/0VspVPJ.png

&gt;Reduced Stream Delay
We’re releasing the reduced delay beta as an option to broadcasters because it does come at a small quality of service cost – particularly to viewers with poor internet connections. Some viewers may experience changes in playback, with shorter, more frequent buffering times. Because less video is queued on a viewer’s computer, they will be more susceptible to variations in download bandwidth, and may experience more interruptions in service while video buffers. Rather than require every channel to switch to the reduced delay option, we’re leaving it up to the broadcaster to decide what is best for his or her community. If you spend a lot of time interacting with chat, a decreased delay may be incredibly beneficial to your community.
We’d love to get your feedback as we iterate on this feature. Have you enabled the reduced delay beta? If so, how has it impacted your community or broadcast? Send your questions and comments to feedback@twitch.tv.

35qzjp,So I talked to my local PD today about SWATing,"At the recommendation of several people here and a few other streamers I went to visit my local Police Department to discuss SWATing.

PSA for those who may not know: 

&gt;
SWATing is when a troll finds the name &amp; address of a streamer and calls in a false hostage report at the address. Police will respond to this by sending a SWAT team to the streamer's residence and can result in physical harm or even the death of family pets. 
&gt;

I spoke with a Sergeant about the topic and it turns out he is actually quite aware of this. In my town alone they have had TEN of these SWATing incidents in the past year!

He reassured me my Township not only understands what SWATing is but also has measures in place to handle these situations. He said it is policy not to kick in a door when they get unconfirmed or otherwise suspicious calls about hostages or weapons at a location (The two most common reports used by SWATers). Nowadays they attempt to call the individual and get them to come outside instead of forcing their way into the property unannounced. 

I ended up having a very pleasant conversation &amp; leaving my name, address, and phone number with the officer. 

I have to say the peace of mind I have now for 30 minutes of my time is priceless. No longer do I have any fear of being SWATed and can be confident when dealing with the Trolls in channel who threaten this sort of thing. 

Tl:Dr If you are serious about streaming go talk to your local PD. Hopefully they will already be familiar as my PD is but if not educate them about streaming/SWATing. It's well worth it for the peace of mind. 

Edit: I'd just like to clarify this is not necessary the moment you start streaming. The people who do this sort of prank calling like to have an audience. Something to consider doing as your channel grows. 

Edit 2: Several people have asked &amp; gotten answers in the comments of how to protect their personal info from leaking. I'm going to summarize them here and add a few more.

**How to protect your identity from potential SWATers as a streamer**

+ Make a brand new username when starting streaming, this means Twitch, Twitter, or any other medium you plan to associate with the stream. You never know what databases your old username has worked it's way into or has been connected to you personally.
+ Don't use your real name as a username for Twitch, Twitter, or any other account connected to streaming.
+ If you are going to collected tips/donations via PayPal upgrade to a [PayPal Business account](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/referral/paypal-business-account2). If you don't PayPal provides your full name to anyone who donates.
+ If you have a website you plan to associate with streaming make sure your [WHOIS information is private](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_privacy), usually and extra $5-10/yr to whoever is the registrar your domain name (GoDaddy, 1&amp;1, etc).
+ Your channel [has a banned words filter](http://gyazo.com/b1850a5d31717b56a93af29d34f139a4) under your Settings-&gt;Channel tab. Make sure you add your last name, street name, township, and last 4 of your phone number to this. This method is much better than having a chatbot delete the message as it blocks it before anyone can see it.
+ Skype is bad, m'kay? Skype is notorious for giving away your IP address, which these Trolls will then call up your ISP (Comcast, Verizon, Cox, etc) and dupe the tier 1 support rep into giving them your info, usually by pretending to be a higher level tech working on your account. Don't add anyone on Skype you don't trust.

Hope those tips help &amp; thanks for all the upvotes everyone. I'm glad my experience has been useful to you guys!

35ayqg,Proper Twitch Etiquette,"Now I like to think I know twitch etiquette, things like not advertising your stream in other people's streams, but something happened last night that confused me. 

I subscribe to 2 channels. Both of course have custom emotes. 

I went into another person's channel (who's partnered) and was watching for a few moments, and I used an emote from one of the two people I subscribe to. The emote made sense too, it was a ""whoa""  emote designed to be use when something happened in a video game that of course makes you go ""whoa"" 

Anyways, I used the emote, the streamer proceeds to go on a rant about how I should never use another streamers emotes anywhere else except that streamers chat room because it's advertising his channel. He then proceeded to ban me permanently from his chat room for advertising someone else. 

I didn't spam this emote, I put 2 in the same line, and this was the only message I sent. 

Like I said, I like to think I know twitch etiquette pretty well. Is this an unwritten rule that I was unaware of or something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/35ayqg/proper_twitch_etiquette/,1431101983.0,60,0.89,55,Twitch,CrisuKomie

Since Sub-Button and quality changes are not available for a new streamer (you have to have a certain amount of viewers over a certain period of time), getting new, consistently watching viewers is made even harder. 
Twitch doesnt have to allow every quality section right from the beginning, but atleast two would be nice, so people with a weaker internet connection can watch new streamers (including me).

34ug0m,10 Things I've Learned in My First Week of Streaming,"Today marks a a full week of streaming, I have learned a few things that I am going to toss out to other new streamers and also see if you guys have any awesome suggestions that I may have overlooked. 


1) Check your OBS Log!!!

First how to do this: Settings --&gt;Open Configuration Folder --&gt; logs --&gt; Date


What I learned from this was things like this:


19:23:12: Audio timestamp for device 'Microphone (USB Audio Device)' was behind target timestamp by 80

My mic was cutting out... people had mentioned it but I was at a loss as too why. Checked my logs saw this and realized I needed to increase my scene buffering time. Who knows how long I would have let this go on. Going to check my logs more often now to ensure everything is running smoothly. 


2) Always prepare to be hosted. 

I've been hosted once... on my very first day. I had one viewer and all of a sudden, had 200. What happened? I fell apart, complete and utterly. I lost focus of the game, started to play horribly and couldn't keep up with chat at all. Since then I have prepared a Hotkey to switch my chat to slowmo. This way I am not so busy trying to keep up with chat, I fail at the game I am playing 3 or 4 times in a row. 


Edit 1: When I wrote this I thought that slowmo might be the answer for a newer streamer, but some people have mentioned it will actually hurt more then help. So I noting that here and totally starting to agree. Like I said I am fairly new to streaming and I would love to hear how some of you guys handle this situation!


3) Laugh at yourself. 

You are going to mess up. I certainly did, all the time. I still do, all the time. I mean last night I was keeping up with 8 viewers, in chat. Playing the Game and trying to keep my thoughts straight after the 6 hour mark and the stream delay... I totally called out another Streamer instead of myself. I just had to laugh and keep going, so poke fun at yourself, if you can't laugh at yourself how are your viewers going to be able too?


4) Don't get disappointed and don't get greedy.

When you get 7 New followers one day and then the next day you get 1 you can feel a bit discouraged. The reality is that in my case I was being greedy. I wanted 7 again. I really love the community I have already grown and I wanted it to keep growing. But hey, instead of focusing on new viewers? I decided to focus on the group I already have who are taking time to watch me! 

5) Webcam Placement


One thing I learned was to put the screen that I am watching chat on on the same side as my Camera. I didn't want a straight on view for my camera, so I have it on a tripod to the left, because of my Mic placement. Well I had chat on a monitor to the right. This might sound crazy, but when I talk to my viewers I am staring at chat... well I wasn't making eye contact in a way, I feel the quality has improved since I moved the screen. Now when I am talking to them, I am looking more directly at them.


6)  It's better to start a few minutes late...

Then to start on time and flail around trying to get everything set up and ready. I did this 3 times and each time I had people come and go when I was trying to get set up. Much better to have things in place and then go... no one wants to watch me get everything ready, they want to watch me joke and play the game.


7) Networking

I fail at networking. You know it is bad when your viewers are doing more on Twitter then you are to promote you. This was certainly an eye opener when I found out that some of my viewers were doing more on Twitter then me. Something I have taken from and will certainly remember. 


8) Look Up Talking Points

Sometimes the game is slow. You have the urge to be quiet. But you have to keep talking and you have nothing to talk about. I started to look up some gaming news and randomly when I find myself in this spot, start rambling off about this or that title that is coming out, ect ect. This has helped greatly, because when I have someone join I am talking about something interesting and it certainly helps to keep people around. 


9) Check your spam folder.

I had one follower send me a message and it got shot into this folder. He shows up every night now and one of the reasons why he has said is because, I took the time to write him back. 


10) Not everyone is going to like you. 

Be it trolls, be it people, be it your friends. Some people are simply not going to like your stream. Just have to live with it and drive on. I don't like every musician, so why should I expect everyone to like me? Keep focused on those who do like you and when someone trolls you, just smile laugh and say things like ""Yeah I do suck man..."" if they don't get to you, they will leave.

33ypi0,We're Here to Help Streamers Grow!,"I'm a streamer and I have posted very successfully in r/twitch before with guides and tips for everyone. (Obviously under my personal twitch/Reddit account)

I know how hard being a streamer is, and somehow we're all on the same adventure.. but doing it alone?

I thought there must be a better way to get there, a way to help each other?

That's when I decided to create a system to get streamers Twitch Partnered faster than ever.

**It costs nothing and anyone can join in.**

(You must be over 13 - this is in compliance with the twitch streamer minimum age!)

We developed our own partnership program with our website ""Dinosaur Moustache"". (Just to clarify we do not pay partners like twitch etc! This is a free service we provide for streamers to use!)

**So how does it work?**

* Every week we pair similar streamers together!
* Watch each others streams!
* Raid each others channels to increase each others viewers &amp; followers!
* Collaborate with each other, do dual streams!
* Host each others channels when you’re offline.
* Completely non intrusive partnership. (It doesn't impact on other partnerships you may have!)

**Why does it benefit you?**

* You are directly supporting like minded Streamers.
* You create genuine friendships with other streamers &amp; their viewership.
* You are no longer hoping for viewers to randomly find your channel, they’ll come from raiding/hosting each others channels!
* Team work builds enthusiasm and commitment increasing the quality of your videos for everyone to see.
* Receive tips and tricks from your paired channel, share inside information that can help take your content to the next level.

**How it all works?**

We pair Streamers based on:

* Most played Game
* Video Language
* Native Language
* Follower Count
* Country
* Age

**Why do we do this for Streamers?**

We are gamers and video creators, and we know first hand how difficult it is to gain recognition.

Building friendships with other Streamers and actively working with a different channel each week exposes both Stream channels to more viewers faster than ever.

We take away the hard work of finding other like minded Streamers. 

We match our partners based on Age, Country, Language, Game types.

This allows us to accurately pair similar gamers!

It’s completely free! So get partnered now!!

http://www.dinosaurmoustache.com/streamers/

That's the website. I'd love to get the word out... we need to unite together :D

I'll do my very best for any and everyone that decides to join the adventure!

I'd like to thank the r/Twitch Mods for their help and permission to do this post! They were incredible and very enthusiastic about DM so a big thanks to you guys!

We'd hope to get about 100 people on board to give us greater pairing capabilities! The partnership program goes live Sunday the 3rd of May 2015!

PS - You guys need to check your emails when you become partnered as its our way of communicating with you :)


**EDIT 1** 

I'm going to sleep now, 1 am in Ireland. I'll be up for work and answering questions in about 8 hours time! Thanks for all the support and questions, incredible! Going to sleep with a smile on my face! :)


**EDIT 2** 

The support is overwhelmingly great! Thank you all! There are emails going out tonight to everyone that has signed up by 6pm this evening (27th April 2015). If you register after this time you will be on the email list tomorrow at the same time! This pattern will continue for the week :) So don't panic! The Emails will explain tonnes of what being a partner is and will clear up a lot of questions! Thanks everyone.

33u3kc,Starting off with Twitch,"**Hello and Welcome to the Guide**  
This guide will hopefully help the new people in the Twitch community when they are get started. It will seem very basic and you will probably know nearly everything here. My main reason for making this guide was for reference purposes.  
Please leave any comments/questions is the comments or tweet me ([@Heep123](https://twitter.com/Heep123)) - I will respond to as many as I can.   
Note: I use a Twitch addon called BetterTTV. This means that there may be dark backgrounds, blue buttons and other slight variations in screenshots.

**Creating your Twitch account**  
The first thing you will need to do is find the sign-up button, you should be able to see one of [these](http://postimg.org/image/9l1udy6cz/) buttons on the site.  
Once you have done this, you should get [this](http://postimg.org/image/ofluedqk3/) pop-up (I have added the numbers to help describe it). These are all the parts of the sign-up page.  
&gt; 1) Facebook Login: You can use this if you have a Facebook account. This can be useful because you don't need more emails and passwords to manage.  
&gt; 2) Username: This is the name that your channel will use and you are shown as in chat. There is currently no way to change usernames, make sure you choose the one you want.  
&gt; 3) Availability: Like most sites, your username must be unique. If you have a green tick, as shown on the screenshot, your username is not being used. If there is a red exclamation mark, the username has been taken.  
&gt; 4) Password: Make sure you choose something that is both complex and easy to remember for you. The best passwords are long, have a mix of special characters, numbers, lowercase letters and uppercase letters.  
&gt; 5) Birthday: This is used to verify your age. You must be at least 13 years of age to have an account on Twitch.  
&gt; 6) Email: Some channels only allow you to chat if you have verified your email. You also have the option to receieve notifications of things happening on Twitch and on your channel.  
&gt; 7) Captcha: This is usually a case of typing 3 or 4 numbers in a box. If you cannot do the challenge, the first of the icons marked * generates a new one. If you still have issues, the second icon changes it to an audio challenge.  
&gt; 8) Links: These are links to the Twitch Terms of Service and the Rules of Conduct. It is important you read these to stop your account being closed.  
&gt; 9) Sign Up: The button you press that creates your Twitch account, providing everything else has been entered correctly.  
  
  *****
  
**Setting up your channel**  
This guide will help you set up four parts of your channel. These are: Channel Logo, Offline Banner, Channel Banner and Bio.   
&gt; 1) Channel Logo - You can set this in your settings [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/profile) You can see where exactly you set this [here.](http://postimg.org/image/a9cj215rb/) This is displayed in several places across Twitch.  
&gt; 2) Channel Bio - This is set in the same place as the Channel Logo. It is displayed when someone visits your profile.  
&gt; 3) Offline Banner - The offline banner is the image that will be displayed on the video player while you are offline. This is set in your settings under Channel and Videos, more specifially, [here.](http://postimg.org/image/fm5ytwj1j/)  
&gt; 4) Channel Banner - This is displayed above your Channel Logo and Bio in your profile. It is also displayed on your chat card. You can set this in your profile using the button shown [here.](http://postimg.org/image/th49cddgn/)  
  
  *****
  
**Your dashboard**  
Your dashboard can be found [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/dashboard) When you are not streaming, and maybe want to host other channels with your account, [this](http://postimg.org/image/oaz3172w7/) image shows some of the main features you will need.  
&gt; 1) Editing - Here, you can give permission for other users to view and change your dashboard, including the channel currently being hosted.  
&gt; 2) Stream Settings - In this section, you can set the stream's language, game and title. If you do not want to select a game, you can set 'Playing' to 'Not Playing' if it was not automatically done.  
&gt; 3) Stream Key - If you want to start streaming, this is basically the password to stream to your channel. **Many people lose their channel through telling people their stream key. Do NOT tell it to anyone, even if they claim they are Twitch Staff. If you think someone may have your key, reset it immediately.**  
  
  *****
  
**Following/Subscribing**  
On other sites, you can keep track of what people are doing through liking, following channels etc. Twitch offers several ways to support the broadcaster. The two most common ones are called Subscribing and Following.  
**Following**  
This is the most commonly used method. Anyone can follow any channel. Following is usually appreciated more by small channels, but it is always good to support all the streamers you like. You can see who a user follows and who they are followed by in the channels profile, under the ['Following' and 'Followers' section.](http://postimg.org/image/4dmd0x4fh/) You can also see the number of followers a channel has under the video player [(see this).](http://postimg.org/image/pm01iciwd/)  
**Subscribing**  
Subscribing is an option that can only done on partnered channels that allow subscriptions. On Twitch, subscriptions cost $4.99 (roughly £3.25) a month. Note that all channel details have been removed. Since subscriptions cost money, there are many more benefits. When a user subscribes, there will be a chat notification and they will recieve their own subscriber badge. You will also be able to use emotes chosen by the channel owner across all of Twitch. In addition, you will be able to talk in Subscribers Only Chat Mode and, in some channels, you can avoid slowmode (see chat basics section). Channel owners sometimes also offer additional benefits (game servers, teamspeak server, etc.) that require subscription. You can cancel subscriptions at any time in your dashboard.  
  
  *****
  
**Chat basics**  
The chat is the best way to interact with the other viewers in the stream. This is a large part of Twitch and one of my favourite features. There are several parts to it. Some of these have been listed here:  
**Badges**  
You will see that some users have an icon next to their username. [This](http://postimg.org/image/qnn1j6ufd/) image from a Twitch blog gives a brief introduction to what these are. The most common ones you will see are: Broadcaster, Channel Moderator, and Turbo User. You will probably find Staff, Admins and Global Moderators in larger channels such as the main [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/twitch) channel. On a partnered channel, some users may have another badge that is only on that channel. This shows that they are a channel subscriber.  
**Modes**  
Twitch offeres several chat modes. These are mostly used in larger channels and are as follows:  
&gt; Slow Mode: You will only be allowed to chat once in a set amount of time that a moderator will have chosen.  
&gt; Subscribers Only Mode: This mode only allow people who are subscribed to the current channel to chat.  
&gt; R9k-Beta Mode: This is the least used of the modes. It is a regex filter which will stop the same messages being constantly repeated.  

**Commands**   
[This](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/659095-chat-moderation-commands) help article contains all of the current commands. Note that some commands are limited to moderator only or broadcaster only.  
**Common Rules**  
I commonly get asked the question, ""Why did I get banned from Twitch for typing in caps?"" Twitch channels usually have a set of rules to keep the chat under control, usually through a bot. There may not be a rules description panel, but they may still apply. Ask the mods! The following is a list of some of the most common rules across channels:  
- Shouting in CAPS (Or LiKe ThIs) is probably not allowed.  
- Posting links before a moderator has permitted it is usually removed by a bot.  
- Symbol Spam, Special Characters and ASCII art will usually result in a timeout or ban.  
- Repeating the same message continuously will result in a timeout.  
- Coloured text (/me) is often considered spam.  
- Abuse to anyone through the chat will usually result in a ban.  
- Discussion of Politics, Religion, etc. is sometimes removed to stop conflict in chat.  
- A few channels only allow the chat to be spoken in a certain language. The main reason for this is so it can be moderated.  
- Unapproved advertising will often lead to a ban, like on most sites.  
  
*****
  
**Emotes**  
You may see some little pictures in this chat. There are two main types of emote. These are global emotes and subscriber emotes. Global emotes are images that can be used across all of Twitch by all users. Subscriber emotes are chosen by a broadcaster, these can be used in any channel but you must be subscribed to the broadcaster that owns the image to use it.  
Some Twitch emotes can be used on this Reddit. [](/Kappa) [](/PJSalt) [](/TheTarFu) [](/BibleThump) [](/WholeWheat)  [](/FailFish) [](/DansGame) You can view more [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJLvIqAd3bgWwJ2nVwnqf3TdZ46fPS9KpXXCob7-9vE/edit)  
Twitch recently added a list of emotes, you can view an example of this [here.](http://postimg.org/image/d0oogewad/) You can see what each numbered part does below.   
&gt; 1) Channel Emotes - Only avaliable on channels that have subscriptions enabled. This shows a list of the emotes you can use while subscribed to the channel. They will have a lock if you are not able to use them.  
&gt; 2) All Emotes - Avaliable in all channels. This shows the global emotes that you can use in the channel.  
&gt; 3) View Emotes - This displays the list that you see in the screenshot.  
     
*****
  
**Description panels**  
Below the channel's video player, there may be several boxes that contain information about the channel. There may also be links to other sites (Donations, Twitter, etc.) the broadcaster uses. You can see an example of these description panels [here](http://postimg.org/image/6ko22rccl/) - Note I have removed some content of the boxes to stop this becoming an advertisment for myself.  
To change the panels on your channel, you can click the 'Edit Panels' button below the video player and share button. The view will then change. In the top box, you can type a stream title. You can add a picture and a redirect link for when a user clicks the image. You can then add a text body which supports [Markdown Formatting](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/839490-markdown-basics) (like Reddit). You can see an example of a finished one [here](http://postimg.org/image/qxjqqh2bv/) - I have removed the text content again.  
  
*****
  
**Directories**  
There are several types of directory on Twitch. A directory is a list of streams that meet a certain criteria that you have selected. This is a great way  to discover new streamers who create content you like. The most used types are:  
[Following Directory](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/following) - This directory shows the live users that you follow. It also shows who the people you follow are hosting.  
[Top Directory](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/all) - The channels in this directory are the most viewed ones across all of Twitch.  
[Random Directory](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/random) - This directory shows random channels that are currently live across Twitch. This can sometimes be a great way to find new streamers.  
Game Directories - Each game has its own directory. You can view some of the most watched games [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/directory) The URL for a game is twitch.tv/directory/game/&lt;game name&gt;. For example, the minecraft directory would be [twitch.tv/directory/game/Minecraft](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Minecraft)  
  
*****
  
**Hosting**  
To support your favourite streamers further, you can host the streamer on your channel. To do this type ""/host &lt;channel name&gt;"" (no quotes) into your chat. To stop hosting a streamer, simply type ""/unhost"" (again, no quotes) into your chat.  
    
*****
  
**Settings**  
[This](http://postimg.org/image/qlgp8v45f/) image shows some of the most common settings you will use. The link to find the settings has been written next to it. Each one is self-explanatory, the idea of this is to gather the ones you need most.  
  
*****
  
**Miscellaneous**  
**Private Messages**  
Twitch has a private messages (PM) feature which can be found [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/messages/inbox) By default, there is a message filter. Sometimes, useful messages you need can go there; you can disable this in your [security settings.](http://www.twitch.tv/settings/security) Here, there are also settings to block messages from strangers.  
**Turbo**  
You may have heard of Twitch Turbo. This is a paid service that Twitch offers to get several improvements to your experience. You can view these benefits and purchase Twitch Turbo [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/settings/turbo)  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/33u3kc/starting_off_with_twitch/,1429982364.0,87,0.95,9,Twitch,Heep123
33q8wd,150+ albums from the OverClocked Records catalog now cleared for Twitch!,"[OverClocked Records](http://overclockedrecords.com/) is a record label featuring awesome artists like Disasterpeace, Big Giant Circles, Joshua Morse, Ben Prunty, Ben Briggs, and many more from the video game community (including yours truly!) It's an offshoot of [OverClocked ReMix](http://ocremix.org/) and there's a lot of overlap between the artists of the two sites.

We've got a catalog of nearly 200 original albums, soundtracks, and arrange albums, and I'm pleased to announce that the **vast majority of our catalog** is now cleared for [streaming on Twitch.tv](http://overclockedrecords.com/streaming/)! Our policy on streaming is really simple:

* Buy albums (many of them are $5 or less)
* Credit / link to the artist
* That's it

No content ID, audio match, royalties, etc. Just look for the Twitch icon on any [album page](http://overclockedrecords.com/release/perfect-getaway/) and you know it's cleared.

If you want to discover new music, you can browse by artist, category, or tag, for example:

* [Breakbeat](http://overclockedrecords.com/product-tag/breakbeat/)
* [Cyberpunk](http://overclockedrecords.com/product-tag/cyberpunk/)
* [Chiptune](http://overclockedrecords.com/product-tag/chiptune/)
* [Mellow](http://overclockedrecords.com/product-tag/mellow/)
etc.

All albums are **lossless, tagged, and DRM-free**. When you buy an album through the site you'll have access to it forever. Plus, we've got **new releases every Monday**.

We also really believe in **supporting our artists**. Most record deals, even indie ones, are pretty bad - taking 50% or more of artist profits. We pay out **80%** to all of our artists and use the rest to improve the site experience. All our deals are non-exclusive too, as we don't believe in restrictive deals that are hostile to musicians.

Any questions, comments? Let me know!

32v4os,WhichTwitch: An Online Twitch Streamer Directory &amp; Community,"Site is now LIVE: www.whichtwitch.com

*Hello everyone. I have had this project approved my the mods here on /r/Twitch so I appreciate their support!*

What I am currently working on (and to be completely honest, almost finished with) is creating a **directory for Twitch Streamers**. The purpose of this directory would be for users to be able to browse and find Twitch streamers. I think we can all agree that the ability to search and find Twitch streamers on the actual Twitch.tv site is very limited. And while that's not entirely Twitch's fault considering they have much higher priorities to be concerning themselves with (improving their infrastructure for one), I still think it's an extremely important element that is missing from what otherwise would be a great site.

As of right now, the only options Twitch offers for a user to find streams is simply by the title of the game and the popularity of the stream. And I don't know about you, but I personally don't always know what exactly I want to watch, and I certainly don't want to spend my time in a channel that has 5,000+ people all talking in chat at once. **So with WhichTwitch, what you will be able to do is refine your search based on more specific criteria - this includes age range, time zone, genre of games mostly streamed, etc**. If you're a streamer, it will help you acquire a userbase of people who find you geniunely interesting due to what and how you stream since they found you by a criteria that they themselves specified. If you're a viewer, it makes finding the perfect and most entertaining stream for you as easy as possible.

In all honesty, I'm sure the site would be an amazing tool for both streamers and viewers to use. The only part I need your help with is to **spread the word**. Even if I do complete the project, it would be pointless to launch it with little to zero interest from the community. My hopes is to garnish a big pre-launch following so that when it is launched, users will be able to utilize it right away instead of waiting for it to gain popularity.

Also in case you're wondering, this is a project I made purely out of my own interest. The site will be ad-free for as long as possible. But considering I have hosting covered, I don't see ads ever being a problem. **What I'm trying to say is, this isn't for financial gain - it's for the community**!

After launch, I do plan on implementing a few more features other than it being a search directory - these would include daily/weekly Streamer promotions (again, for free of course), Twitch news / support/ tutorials, reviews of streams and games, and anything else the community would like to see.

Anyway, I've made this long enough. I hope this sounds as exciting to you guys as it does to me, and again I ask that you help spread the word so we can make this happen! If you have any questions, feel free to reply here, tweet me, or email me.

32rpnf,Be a pal. Let the Streamer know if something seems off.,I know we don't like backseat streamers and sometimes suggestions can be unwelcome if we are happy with the way we stream but as streamers if it seems like something is wrong let us know. A few times now I've accidentally had my mic muted (I use a camera and was moving my mouth) and people were coming in and out and even sending chat messages. No one told me my mic wasn't on. I know it's not my viewers job to check on my own mic but if something seems off like that let a streamer know.

32lyt1,Free panels pack for variety streamers,"Not too long ago, I posted [Survival Panels Pack](http://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/31bw9s/survival_panels_pack_basic_panels_package_styled/), which was my first contribution of this type to Twitch community. Thank you for the support!  

I promised, that next time there will be something focused more on starting, variety streamers, so here is Allround Panels Pack 1.  

Like the previous one, it contains 8 panels (JPG), labeled: About, Schedule, PC Spec, FAQ, Twitter, Facebook, Rules and YouTube. You can see the preview below.

http://i.imgur.com/5pg4jZv.jpg

Download for this package is available [here](http://thingsforstreams.com/) as well as the previous package and future packs.  

Just to make everything clear, you CAN use it commercially, you can't resell it (this package is free for everyone) or claim it to be your own work.  

EDIT: URL update  

EDIT: **Offer update.** Some packages, including the one mentioned in this thread, are no longer free. Due fragmentation of packages (free, premium, animated and so on) and multiple required updates to maintain high quality, they were merged into one package with a single price. 
Unfortunately, Reddit doesn't allow edit titles of threads, but if you are looking for a free package, you can find packages that are to be forever free on the [T4S website](http://thingsforstreams.com/) (filter by `free` tag).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/32lyt1/free_panels_pack_for_variety_streamers/,1429046309.0,108,0.98,47,Twitch,Belar_

31sww9,2 weeks old viewbotter just got partnered,"A 2-week-old channel that was viewbotting from day one and probably all of his broadcasts and that obviously also bought followers just got partnered. Despite numerous people have reported this very very obvious case multiple times. Why does this happen?

In the past small channels carefully chose which game to stream and  thoughtfully planned when to stream to get as much exposure as possible. Today they hope for moments with only a few viewbotters (screenshot from last weekend)...

http://i.imgur.com/8fOxsOc.png

http://i.imgur.com/QwcKsGg.png

I know that some do not care about viewbotting at all and don't want to read about it frequently but as long it's an issue it probably will be discussed. So if you don't want to read about an issue then maybe do something about the issue instead of opposing those who do care...

Viewbotting is a violation of the ToU, it's unfair, it's anti-social, it's cheating, it's devalueing the efforts of all the channels that play fair and it's a source of frustration, it's hoaxing viewers fx by eluding viewer count as an indicator of quality, it's diminishing the revenues of legit partnered channels, it's inducing costs for Twitch and consequently Twitch's partners and customers, it's jeopardizing the trust in Twitch as a platform, etc.

So what can be done about it? What can Twitch do? What can streamers do? What can viewers do?

""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."" - attributed to Edmund Burke
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
**E D I T:** How do you know they were botting? I probably should have foreseen this question. In some cases -incl. all on the screenshots above- it's pretty easy detect. The viewer lists were infested by bot accounts.

Now how do you tell bot accounts from regular accounts? One example: If you find a seemingly viewbotted channel scroll down the viewer list, check out ~10 viewers in a row, in case of one type of heavy viewbotting you find that half or more of these viewers have a blank profile, follow about the same channels in about the same order - which is almost impossible to happen organically with human viewers.

Then you might want to check out the followers list of a channel these bot accounts are following, for example with https://twitchtools.com/followers which produces a list like in this screenshot (happens to be the just partnered channel...): http://i.imgur.com/VcrwgyS.png

On that list you can see that 50+ followers happened to follow the channel in less than 40 seconds - in fact much more but that's how much was possible to squeeze into a screenshot, lol. On the list you can also see that those accounts were all created 2 days before withing a timeframe of 20 minutes and coincidentally in the exact order they started following this channel...
When you check out those accounts you'll find that they are following ~same amount of channels, quite exactly the same channels in quite exactly the same order and happen to be the ones populating viewer lists of some specific channels...

So it's in some cases no rocket science at all. So if you come across suspicious situation, maybe investigate and report. 

And if Twitch can't do anything about each and every viewbotter they should be at least be able to do more against some types of bot accounts based on not all too complicated algorithms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/31sww9/2_weeks_old_viewbotter_just_got_partnered/,1428445594.0,112,0.92,106,Twitch,EricGu
31pc9i,How to deal with harassment and abuse from another streamer?,"Hey folks. Throwaway account here. I'm a Twitch partner, and I'm having a hell of a time trying to figure out how to deal with another streamer who has made it his mission to make my life miserable on twitch.

This guy stream snipes me, directs a lot of extremely offensive hateful language towards myself and others in my channel, he uses voice clips he's taken from my channel as his sound bites when he gets tips and follows, and he keeps creating alt accounts to evade bans in my channel.

Reporting through twitch (and actually, a lot of folks in my channel reporting) has yielded NO results. Trying to talk to the Partner Help email address has yielded no results. This is making streaming extremely uncomfortable, and all I would like is for an admin to take notice and help put an end to the behavior.

30e8v4,"OBS Multiplatform 0.9.0 released: Filters (chroma key, color correction, video delay, image masks), dark theme, audio/video sources, native Blackmagic device support, and more","In case you missed the news yesterday, OBS just came out with a major new alpha release for its Multiplatform version on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Alpha 0.9.0 sees the release of a huge new feature, **Filters**. Filters can be added to almost any source type, and allow for chroma key, color key, color correction, cropping, and image masks, and for certain sources, you can also apply a video delay to the source. Right click on the source and go to Filters to start playing around with it. (Hint: for image mask, create a black and white image in an editing program to create the shape of your mask, with the black parts as the things to cut out, and the white parts as the things to show from the source. That way, you do things like make your webcam circular, or any shape, really.)

The **dark theme** provides a nice, clean, cool interface for OBS that gives it a more professional look and won't hurt your eyes if you're in a dark production room. You can enable it from Settings &gt; General.

The **Media Source** is also a huge new addition, which allows you to add audio and video files as sources to OBS Multiplatform directly. Using FFmpeg, it will play any media file FFmpeg supports, including animated GIFs.

**Native Blackmagic support** is good news for Mac and Linux users who don't have a lot of options when it comes to capture card selection. Most capture card manufacturers only make drivers for Windows, but Blackmagic's API works on all 3 platforms, making it easy to use the devices on any computer.

There are also lots of other features in OBS Multiplatform that have been out for a while, but people might not have known about -- the biggest of which is **the ability to locally record in any format at a different bitrate** while streaming at the same time. To do this, go to Settings &gt; Output and change the Mode to Advanced. You will then get separate options for Streaming and Recording. On the Recording tab, change the encoder to FFmpeg, and then you can output your video file in any format that FFmpeg supports (which is pretty much all of them). Just name the output file with the correct extension (e.g. if you want to save as MKV, name the output file ""whatever.mkv"") and the FFmpeg output plugin will do the rest automatically. You can also change your bit rate from this screen as well.

Enjoy!

2zw287,So I was raided tonight...,"About 60 people came into my chat all at once and started posting my personal info, I guess someone had found my info and organized the group through a raid forum. My phone number, address, full name etc. where all posted over and over again.

They called my phone off the hook, ordered pizza, chinese food and escort services to my house, they threatened to DDOS and swatt and they posted adds on craigslist for my area using my info in the sex/hook up section.

I ended up banning a handful of them and putting the chat in sub only mode for about an hour and I called my local police department to let them know what was going on in case of a swatting scenario. Surprisingly they where REALLY cool about it, the officer I talked to took down the numbers of everyone who had been calling me, and he let me know that they would call my number to let me know if there where any calls made about my address before coming and breaking my door down.

The situation was actually a lot shittier than I thought something like that would be. Being harassed and threatened by 60 people sucks no matter what, but its on another level when they all have your name, address and phone number.

I feel like I dealt with the situation as best a could and tried to laugh it off move past it but it really wore me out and it scares me that there are people out there that actually enjoy organizing together to fuck with people like that.

I guess the reason I'm making this post is to just spread awareness and see if anyone has any similar experiences, what happened and how did you deal with it?

I specifically Overlay 1 for CS:GO, since I know a majority of the /r/Twitch community plays that game (from observation), but you can use it in pretty much any game. I will make another post later this weekend with more free overlays for other games (Call of Duty, Destiny, LoL, and maybe Minecraft.)

Remember, these are simple just to get the smaller channels a little something to make your channel look nicer and clean.

***Any suggestions are much appreciated. Have fun streaming!***

**Edit:** I focus around making my overlays as simple and non obstructive as possible. The main focus is the gameplay. Remember that guys/girls!

**Edit 2:** I added the second batch of free Panels and a new Overlay!

2zgpi5,"The Twitch Rules of Conduct, inconsistencies in how they're enforced, and the potential dangers this entails","What sparks this particular discussion from me is a dispute over what entails ""gaming content"" and the enforcement of this blanket rule of ""gaming content only"" being too vague and thus abusable. For instance, many streamers watch youtube videos in between queues in games or as discussion points for their chatters. Technically speaking this can be considered non-gaming content. That being said, it's behavior that's well accepted within the Twitch community and most would consider it benign enough to be fair to let broadcasters do this if this is not the entirety of their stream.

I've spoken personally to broadcasters large and small who have had run ins with Twitch admin/staff, I've spoken to several members of the Twitch community that would have knowledge of how rule-breaking is handled by Twitch. I'm not going to name the people I've spoken to, I'm sorry, I know it hurts my credibility, but this argument is going to imply that there is room for abuse within the system as it is now. I'd rather not have any potential abuse aimed at those who have freely spoken with me.

I'm not here to accuse Twitch staff or admins, my objective is to provide an argument that displays the potential dangers an unclear and inconsistently enforced ruleset can have on the streaming ecosystem. For many streaming is a job, and having power over one's main source of income is a power that should be wielded delicately.

First, I'd like to talk about how the rulesets for broadcasters are convoluted, overly complex, and extremely vague. I have heard that the rulesets are so vague that two different admins can come to two completely different conclusions for the same breach of the ToS. I have heard that rules have been so vague at points that certain admins/staff would dodge dealing with certain issues entirely as they didn't know how to properly handle it. There's a ""non-gaming content"" rule, yet a music section, a gaming talk show section, and a bunch of sponsored streams that have only the barest of connections to ""gaming content"". Adding onto this people like Lethalfrag were given permission to do a cooking show at one point under the pretense that since he's a gaming personality that it's considered relevant to gaming content.

Next there's the part where women streaming in only a bra or a bikini were getting shut down, but men could have their shirts off and do streams specifically titled ""No-shirt streams"". This wasn't amended until an outcry from the community. Showing gratuitous cleavage is fine, but showing bare feet on stream is worthy of a suspension culminating in the dank meme ""show feet"" seen in many chats to get an unwitting broadcaster shutdown.

If you take a look at the [Rules of Conduct](http://www.twitch.tv/p/rules-of-conduct) on Twitch's site it might not seem so bad on the surface. But then you read and see things like this:

&amp;gt;occurrences [of nudity] in game are ok so long as you do not make them a primary focus of your stream and only spend as much time as needed in the area to progress the game's story.

They allow games with nudity (To a point, there is a banned games list, but it's surprisingly light), but ""only spend as much time as needed in the area""? It sounds utterly ridiculous, and completely subjective.

I'm not going to go in the specifics and extenuating circumstances of all the rules, but feel free to peruse it as there's a few blatant ones. I'm going to move onto inconsistency, and the potential dangers it entails.

Inconsistency can exist due to several reasons. Grey areas and biases towards broadcasters either negatively or positively. Grey areas would be things like extenuating circumstances too specific for any ruleset to reliably cover, poor admin training, and an unclear warning system for broadcasters. Grey areas are problematic but education, transparency, and dialogue between the offender and admin/staffer could easily resolve anything that comes up. The other reason for inconsistency is biases, and this is where things get a little nasty.

If hypothetically one broadcaster is streaming youtube videos to their stream, a large streamer at that, they set an example to other streamers. It's reaching a large audience, it's noticeable, and so you see bunches of people like this you would assume this content is fine for your own stream. But the actuality is ambiguous, as you could be taken down for this type of content, but you don't expect to be - much like going 5 mph above the speed limit on a highway.

When things become ambiguous enough that someone in power can hold a bias towards you, and then look up a rule and make a vague connection to dole out a punishment then a serious problem has arose. This shouldn't be possible, this is not normal of a stable system. It's akin to how some third-world countries have tons of inane, irrelevant, and archaic laws that no one follows but are still technically legally viable. Corrupt cops then use this to extort those unaware of these laws and/or who are tourists without warning.

When a potential for abuse enters the equation, and we're dealing with professional streamers who make their living off broadcasting it becomes difficult to speak out. Shutting up and taking your punishment, even if you might feel it's unfair, becomes the only recourse. If a bias could've gotten you suspended then what's to say your career won't be further impacted by speaking out against it? The mere potential for abuse is enough to cause this kind of reaction in a broadcaster. Even if it happens to be a justified suspension the very fact the system has holes in it that would allow for abuse destroys any trust in having an open dialogue about the suspension.

So this post isn't just me bitching, I'll offer potential solutions to get the ball rolling.

1. Clearer rules. You're a very large company, Twitch, it shouldn't be too hard to get a bit more specific with the language of your ruleset.

2. Enact a better warning system (Or one that works at all). There are specific reports of the warning system either not functioning as intended, or not functioning at all. Saying ""It should've warned you"" is a failing on Twitch's side. There should be no doubt before suspending or banning a partner that the person involved has had ample warning.

3. Encourage your admins/staff to have an open dialogue with the rule breaker to establish if the intent is malicious or not. The difference between someone who knows they're breaking the rules and someone who doesn't should be factored in. We're human beings, we make mistakes, I'm sure broadcasters would be open to talking.

4. Have resources for your admins to take advantage of to educate themselves on grey areas. A senior member with experience would be preferable if they have a good track record for fairness and consistency.

5. Offer a way for broadcasters to appeal bans with no consequences for trying. Being scared of trying to appeal a ban should be a worrying sign.

NoTears, brave rustlers. RIP on into the aether.

Edit: For transparency sake this has been resubmitted due to rules 2 and 4 being broken originally. A moderator of this subreddit has said they would allow me to resubmit if it doesn't break their rules. I have tried to sterilize this post of rulebreaking without hurting the supporting evidence, points, and spirit of the argument I make.

Edit2: It seems this post has gotten some traction. Due to me having to rewrite and resubmit rather than my first post working out off the bat I'm pretty tired at this point.

2zga0r,Breaking down language barriers,"I thought maybe someone here might enjoy this story: I was bored the other day and so I was browsing through the random streams page on Twitch and clicked one at random, which turned out to be a Russian guy playing League with no viewers. I don't speak Russian or even play League but he seemed like a nice guy so I tried asking ""en?"" in his chat. He replied in broken English that he barely spoke English.

Unwilling to give up, I opened Google translate and translated ""can you understand me if I use a translator?"" into Russian to which he said ""yes"" aloud in English. So I started asking him questions and stuff by translating my messages to Russian first and saying them in chat. He was so nice he opened Google translate himself and started translating his Russian to English and trying his best to say it out loud to me (sometimes shaking his head when he could tell the meaning of the message had gotten lost in the translation).

I sat in his stream for almost three hours communicating with him and it was so heart-warming to be able to converse with someone like that without speaking their language. I picked up a little Russian from him and now whenever I say hello in his stream he opens Google translate on his second monitor immediately.

Sometimes I've asked in my translated English if he knows what his shirt says (he has designs on them like ""Parental Advisory Warning"" or ""The City that Never Sleeps"") and I'll tell him what they say since he can't read them.

I just thought maybe someone would enjoy what I thought was a neat story about Twitch bringing people that are so far away from each other in so many ways together.

2z8aye,So... Its clicked...,"So, i've been streaming for about a year or so, off and on, more on than off, but you know how you get when youre playing to the same 5 people for a month, you get a bit disheartened.

I had managed to get up over 900 followers in the 10 months, and started to pull 10-15 viewers on a regular basis, doesnt sound like much, but felt like an achievement. I was playing games like DayZ, Project Zomboid, and other more popular games.

I've always played games that i thought i ""should"" be streaming, the more popular games on twitch that i like. Not the games i LOVE playing and have played for years.

I decided to play a game i play CONSTANTLY off stream, Football Manager. The only reason i didnt stream it in the past is i never thought it'd be a great stream game.

And in the last 3 streams (4 days, i take Saturdays off), i've gained 250+ new followers, consistently playing to 40+ viewers, and am LOVING streaming at the moment.

I've put a couple of posts up on FM forums and the reddit of which i am a part of, but no way near as much advertising as i have done for my streams of other games!

And it clicked... you HAVE to play a game you love, i have seen it said numerous times, but its never really resonated with me, until now.

If you love the game, its not a chore, and if you love the game, your passion for it will transmit to your viewers. And the more engaging you are through your passion, the better the stream.

Its a very niche market on a very niche part of the internet, but after only 3 streams, i'm usually in the top 3 broadcasters for the game, and it drops off around 1am, its a game with a massive european fanbase so i cant stream through the night as much as i used to. But i finally feel like im going somewhere with this.

I know 40-50 people isnt much, and its a small game on twitch, but you gotta dare to dream.

Keep playing the game you love and could play all day, stream or not, and if you're passionate and entertaining about the game you love, other people who love the game will want to come back.

I made a video about this awesome software.(I asked the developer for permission to make this because I was so impressed and he said I could)

I hope it helps anyone struggling in the community with audio issues!

I came across Auto Duck in real time and was blown away by how much it improved my stream audio quality!

Viewers can hear my voice better than ever, they can hear people I'm playing with in Teamspeak/Skype perfectly now!

No more juggling audio levels!

It dynamically lowers game/music.. well any volume you want lowered it will oblige when you speak or anyone in TS speaks :)

2yyjk8,Use a Batch File to Get Your Stream Ready in Seconds!,"When I first started streaming, I thought it was just opening the game, opening OBS, and I was ready to go. As the weeks went on, I started adding more and more steps: Chatty here, TwitchAlerts there, and suddenly I was spending minutes before every stream hunting down executables and opening browser tabs. If this is you, there's a great solution: batch files!

This specific method only works for Windows, but I assume other platforms have similar solutions (please share them in the comments!).

First, create a new text file. I do this in Notepad, but any plain text editor should do. I called my file ""Stream Start.txt"".

On the first line, write ""@echo off"" without the quotation marks. This keeps the file from printing the commands to the command prompt.

On subsequent lines, type the following for every application you want to launch, replacing the brackets as appropriate:

    Start ""&lt;window title&gt;"" ""&lt;file path&gt;""

For instance, my line for OBS looks like this:

    Start ""OBS"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\OBS\OBS.exe""

The easiest way to find an application's file path is to create a shortcut to that application (click and drag the file somewhere, and release while holding down Alt). Right-click the new shortcut and choose ""Properties"". The line after ""Target"" is the file path.

Need your browser to launch with your dashboard and TwitchAlerts (or any other url) ready to go? Just add the url(s) after the file path:

    Start ""Chrome"" ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" ""http://www.twitch.tv/dashboard"" ""http://www.twitchalerts.com""

Continue adding whatever applications you need on separate lines, then save the file. Change the extension from .txt to .bat and you're ready to go. When it's time to launch your stream, double-click your batch file and everything loads for you automatically.

I know this tip isn't terribly revolutionary, but I stumbled around in darkness until learning this trick, and thought it might be useful for at least some of you.

2yggd5,A stream shut down his Twitch channel and Twitter without warning. Should I be concerned?,"*A streamer shut down his channel. Anyways, a couple weeks ago, I started watching a small streamer. He had just started streaming, and was upbeat and interacted with his chat a lot. However, over the next week, he began to change. After a massive troll raid, he decided to mod a couple people.  And during that time, he was depressed and down due to some personal issues.  He was also a lot less interactive with chat, and would not look at it as often. I asked if he needed to talk, and he said everything will be fine. 

During one of his streams last week, someone who always comes in to be a troll saying nasty stuff, was causing trouble. But he wouldn't let me time them out because the troll wasn't doing anything wrong. He then took away my mod sword, and when I asked him why, he said because he will  use Nightbot in the future. Today I went to his Twitter and Twitch, and they are both gone. This makes me very sad. He did give off a depressing vibe during his last few streams, but I wish I could have helped more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2yggd5/a_stream_shut_down_his_twitch_channel_and_twitter/,1425919655.0,206,0.88,36,Twitch,pillowman205

as it turns out, reddit wont let me sticky threads older than 24 hours, so making a new thread to sticky for visibility.

Quite a few threads of people having issues with twitch this past day or so. Instead of info being spread across several threads and threads clogging things up, it would be better to keep it to one thread where everyone can post about their issues and solutions.

----

**Troubleshooting and Diagnostic steps**

If you have not done this already, try the following guides

1.) [CHANGING YOUR DNS](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1444294-how-to-switch-your-dns)

2.)  [FLUSHING DNS CACHE](https://www.whatsmydns.net/flush-dns.html)

3.) Twitch is aware of the issue. Read [this](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1730938-dns-issue-help) and file a report with twitch.

if changing the DNS does not solve the issue, try using other public dns servers [from this list](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/a/free-public-dns-servers.htm). be sure to flush your dns cache after changing.

SOME users have reported that by disabling their firewall, it has allowed them to access twitch. If you have windows firewall enabled, or a 3rd party antivirus with firewall built in, try disabling it temporarily. 

If you see a grey screen try [this](http://twitchtips.com/grey-screen/)

**Reporting the issue in this thread**

things that would help:

 - screenshots of the issue
 - How long it has been going on
 - steps you have taken (if any) to resolve the issue
 - name of your ISP
 - Can you access twitch on any other devices or computers on your network?

For anyone that's resolved any issues with the site not loading, feel free to post it, but try to keep from posting duplicate solutions.

This is much more accurate than using a speedtest since it uses a single RTMP connection just like streaming, which takes into account the route and latency to Twitch. Speedtest sites use multiple connections with very little latency so the result is unrealistic for finding the optimal stream bitrate.

2vwkke,How I found love (or love found me) on Twitch. Happy Valentine's day!,"Hi all!

So many posts here are about the same things: What are the best settings, Am I growing fast enough, Is Twitch down right now? So, since it’s Valentine’s day, I decided to share a different story on Reddit. It’s the story of how I found love (or rather, love found me, on Twitch). So get some hot chocolate, make yourself comfortable, and enjoy the (true!) story. (Or just skip to the TL;DR part.)


**Once upon a time on Twitch …**

Nearly a year ago, in early March 2014, I started streaming on Twitch. I had been watching various streamers for about 6 months, and decided I would like to give it a try too. I had a blast!
At the same time, my (now) boyfriend started streaming as well. One day, he was looking for streamers to watch in the little spare time he had when he was not streaming. He came across my channel and decided to follow. I was a bit concerned about his username (ForTheVoyeur, the troll alarm in my head was already going off), but he turned out to be a cool guy. One day he sent his viewers over to raid me. I hadn’t realized he streamed as well, so I decided to check out his stream one day. Cool guy, very interactive, and a nice community, so I followed.


**… a boy and a girl got to talking on TeamSpeak …**

Within a few months of me starting my streaming adventure, I joined a very small stream team consisting of a few streamers who were all just starting out. We were all very interactive and since we were all starting out, it was nice to support each other by chatting, raiding, and doing team streams. At some point, ForTheVoyeur became aware of the stream team, and asked to join. Everyone checked him out, we all said yes, and so we ended up on the same stream team.

Because ForTheVoyeur was good with Photoshop, he offered to make the rest of the team overlays. One night we were all in TeamSpeak together, talking about the overlays, and about the stream team in general. One by one, people went to bed, until it was just me and him talking. We were no longer talking about the overlays or the team, but about our family, the places we lived, and holidays we’d like to take one day. It was super easy to talk to him, and we really clicked. Since that day on TeamSpeak in May, we have talked nearly every day.


**… decided to meet up irl …**


Of course, after talking to someone for so long, there comes a point where you have to meet them. We talked about meeting up, and I decided I’d like to visit him in July. I haven’t mentioned this up to now, but he lives in a different country. It’s not that far away – I live in the Netherlands, he lives in Scotland – but it’s still kind of a big thing to book flights to meet someone who you’ve only talked to online.

In July, I met ForTheVoyeur for the first time. It was a little bit awkward at first. But only a little bit, and only for a little while. We had talked so much already, and we’d gotten to know each other pretty well, and in real life we clicked as well as we did online. It was sad to say goodbye again after spending 5 awesome days together.

I went back to Scotland to visit him in September, he came to the Netherlands in November, and we spent Christmas and New Year’s together in Scotland. I’m going to visit him again in March (already counting down the days), and he’s coming over for a LAN in April. 


**… and lived happily ever after.**

I can write a lot about how much it sucks to be in a long-distance relationship, but I won’t. I’m always counting down the weeks/days till I can get to the airport again. We have been talking about moving in together for a while, and we decided it would make most sense for me to move over to Scotland. That’ll be happening in May. I’m super excited for that! No more sad goodbyes and counting down days.

I could never have thought that all this would happen when I started streaming 11 months ago. On top of enjoying myself streaming on Twitch and growing a lovely community, I fell in love, got into a long distance relationship, and decided to move to another country to be with my boyfriend. A 21st century love story!

Feel free to comment or ask questions!

Happy Valentine’s day!
- Lau1187


**TL;DR**: I met my boyfriend through Twitch, and I’m moving to another country in May to be with him!

2vsbxk,A collection of useful tools/sites,"# This is basically going to be an ongoing list as more people from the community add to it

## Donation Services
*****
* [StreamTip](https://streamtip.com/)
A well tested site used by numerous streamers. It also has plenty of features built in.
* [TwitchAlerts](http://www.twitchalerts.com/)
A multi-purpose site which can also accept donations. One notable thing is that it can also accept Stripe payments once you link your account.
* [Donation-Tracker](http://www.donation-tracker.com/)
Not very well known, but used by a few streamers. Has similar features to the rest of the services.
* [Support-The-Stream](http://www.supportthestream.com/)
Another streaming site with a clean layout. It takes none of the donation from its service (Paypal will still take their cut).
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
A site where you can support individuals and create custom tiers of monthly payments. Similar to a subscription feature. Mentioned by /u/Elementalstorm

##Programs to Stream with (or record)
*****
* [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
Arguably the most common streaming software on Twitch. It has many features built in as well as the option to expand with plugins.
* [X-Split](https://www.xsplit.com)

* [Mishira](http://www.mishira.com/)

* [Dxtory](http://exkode.com/dxtory-features-en.html)
(Dxtory's Directshow output into OBS/Xsplit is a far better solution than using either programs fullscreen game capture alone. It is less resource intensive by far. It also allows you to full screen capture games and output into FFsplit (which otherwise doesn't have full screen game support). The other advantage is that this method allows you to use the full capabilities of your SLI or CFX system where as the straight OBS/Xsplit gamecapture will be a huge hit in performance.

2vh3cc,It's time for Twitch.TV to implement Live Captioning.,"Hello everybody,

Little information about me: I was born deaf and I have been using hearing aids since I was about 2 year old. With hearing aids, I am currently hard of hearing and have limited hearing. To this day, I still cannot understand what people are saying online, even though I can hear them talking. For me, voices are basically like white noise coming from TV. I've been playing Counter-Strike franchise competitively since 1.0 (year 2000, I believe) and I am now playing CSGO competitively (I play in ESEA). With that being said, I also watch a lot of professional CSGO streams with approximate 50-80k viewers in them and it's gotten to the point where I'm completely frustrated not being able to understand what the casters are saying.


Anyways...my point is...

It would be really, REALLY nice of Twitch.TV to finally open up to a larger audience (hearing impaired, deaf, and non-English speaking people) by implementing live subtitles/closed captioning on live streams similar to the one being used in live TV news in this day and age.

Obviously, it would mean Twitch.TV have to hire a lot of ""captioners"" (aka stenographers or court reporters) and paying them over time for availability. I can see a lot of potential coming out of this, honestly. Imagine Twitch.TV selling hourly rate options to people who want to see closed captioning on a specific live stream or multiple live streams. Obviously, the captioning would only appear to those who purchased for it and implemented like YouTube's CC on/off option.

I mean, come on it's 2015. I would love to see this happen eventually. It would mean A LOT to me because I want to know what the casters are saying.

If Twitch.TV do implement this idea, I'm just hoping they don't go with automatic captions instead because it's completely inaccurate.

There is the guide I created to help beginners get a grasp on Photoshop, OBS and streaming in general.

It streamlines everything I have learnt in my first 3 weeks.

I am by no means a ""big"" streamer. But my streams are complimented for there quality, design as well as my set up.

I hope this gets to the people that need it.

I put in a lot of work into it and even made a youtube video to explain Photoshop &amp; overlays. It's linked in the guide document.

If it helps you consider following me on twitch, youtube, twitter so I can continue helping and doing what I love.

I want to do streams on health and fitness, computer building, creating nice streaming set ups, along side gaming.

I'll answer any and all questions.

My twitch is linked as flair I believe so you can find me by clicking that.

Cheers,

[edit 1]

If you are currently streaming and your settings are working for you, I am not saying you should change them at all. 

This is for people that are thinking about it and want to know how to set it all up without any hassle. 

Of course lowering the bitrate and fps will allow for a larger amount of viewers and I completely agree and understand the logic. 

The settings I have recommended are what works for me and what my viewers like, that's why I've recommended them. 

[edit 2]

I will be changing the aero settings in the guide and explaining for every one to enable it, I have it disabled due to an error when capturing a friends webcam via skype when broadcasting. Sorry for the confusion

I frequent the website Kotaku, today they had an amazing article on how to protect yourself online. They give you websites that are frequently used by people to dox people (""dox"" is a term that's used when someone gathers all your personal information and then releases it).

You can see how this information can easily lead to swatting. So I wanted to share. The websites they list allow you to type in your name and see what information it brings up. The article also provides links to have your information from those sites removed. I personally did this for Spokeo, and 10digits and found that I am no longer on those sites.

This isn't uncommon, except the phrase they were bombing was a hash tag followed by a very inappropriate sexual reference to my friend.  We started instantly banning all of them.  The streamer himself then entered the chat and claimed that his viewers decided to do that on their own.  The only problem with this story (besides throwing his viewers under the bus) is that he has past broadcasts enabled, so we were able to literally go back and watch him send out the call for his viewers to harass another streamer.  He was banned, reported and within about two minutes his profile and his 2000+ followers turned in to...

2tdpw2,Reflections On 2 Years Streaming From A Small/Medium Streamer,"As my two year streaming anniversary is coming up I’ve been looking back at my time spent in the streaming world. It’s amusing to see how many misconceptions I had prior to streaming and the lessons I’ve taken as I’ve gone on my journey. The following is a small collection of my thoughts and observations I’ve had along my way. I would like to note that this is not a guide to streaming, what works or doesn’t work for me might not have the same results for anyone else.  

Before I started streaming I had a dream to stream for a living. I made a business plan, thinking I’d make partner in a year and be able to go full time in two. I started streaming two times a day, for an average combined total of around ten hours per day. The beginning was slow, but I was seeing a fairly constant rise in viewership, helped by a few raids from known well-established streamers early on in my “career”. Things were looking good. This was the honeymoon period. Everything was new and exciting. The sky was the limit. This lasted for about four months.  

After the initial honeymoon period came a time of stagnation for my channel. I’d put in the work, stream every day, and yet I didn’t seem to progress at all. The amount of time spent streaming was taking a toll on my physically and emotionally. Streaming close to ten hours a day while having a day job is a huge task, one that I took lightly in the beginning, but was slowly and surely catching up with me. My life was out of balance. Streaming became something that I wasn’t doing for the enjoyment but something I had to do. So not only was I making myself stream, I wasn’t even making much if any progress towards my goal. This was a rough period and I knew I wouldn’t be able to continue this way. I decided to cut my time streaming to one shift a day six days a week.  This was a necessary and beneficial change. I had more energy, enjoyed my time streaming, and in general was more actively engaged when I was streaming.  

The one year mark arrived. My target of hitting partnership passed and I was still nowhere near getting partnered. However by this time I had realized that my initial goal may have been a tad naive. Since I still enjoyed streaming and my life was in balance I continued. I started making progress again and my channel grew a bit. At this time, Twitch started lowering their partnership requirements. I applied once, got a boilerplate rejection notice. Waited a couple months and applied again. Same boilerplate rejection notice. This time I sent an email asking for constructive criticism. What they would like to see in order for them to partner me. I received a reply with some areas that could show improvement. Taking those suggestions in mind, I worked on those aspects of my channel. After another couple of months I applied again, once again I was denied.  

This is where it’s very easy to become jaded and perhaps jealous. I had those thoughts. I see peers with perhaps less viewership than me getting accepted while I keep getting that rejection email in my inbox. I’m working my butt off and see streamers just sitting and using their physical assets to rake in the money and views. I start thinking that Twitch is out to get me, it’s an exclusive club and I don’t have a member’s card. It’s not true. The world isn’t out to get me, the world is looking out for itself. Twitch will do what’s in the best interest of Twitch, which is mainly making money. It’s not really a bad thing, it’s the nature of business. What’s necessary is educating Twitch on the merits of partnering me. Complaining that other peers are partnered while I’m not isn’t productive, it’s actually detrimental. I’ll get stuck in a spiral and eventually think it’s impossible and quit.  

Having sorted myself out, I replied to my last rejection email outlining the progress I’ve made concerning the issues of their previous rejection as well as stating the merits of having me a partner. Once again I asked for constructive criticism on what other areas they felt needed improvement. Incredibly enough instead of a reply I received an approval email. Success! A year and a half it took, but I’m partner, baby!  

Many people might think that once you’re partnered you’ve made it. The reality is once you’ve made partner you’re just beginning. For me there was no rush of money. The initial influx was basically enough to buy dinner at a restaurant. However it’s a beginning, and any amount of money was better than the zero I was making before. I had made a little bit off of donations before, but I didn’t have a donation ticker or huge notifier, and it amounted to less than $100 total over a year and a half. I once again realized that I had no idea what I was getting into when I first started streaming. But it was ok. While I initially had started streaming as a possible way of making extra income, it wasn’t the only reason. I enjoyed streaming, I enjoyed having conversations with people, and hey it was still possible to make a decent income sometime in the future.  

So here I am, almost two years from my first broadcast. There have been peaks and valleys, I make nowhere close to the amount of money I thought I’d be making (I have fewer subs than my age) but it’s been a wonderful ride. I’m definitely looking forward to the next two years and seeing where the road takes me. I’d like to close with some observations I’ve made during my time streaming. They might not be right for you, but it’s something to think about.  

* Have a plan going in, but be ready to make changes  
    * Life rarely goes according to plan. Don’t be afraid to make changes as time goes on. Remember life is fluid.  
  

* Focus on you  
    * It’s easy to get caught up in this streamer’s doing this, why is this streamer so successful when I’m not? That girl just sits there, why does she have so many viewers and donations? Honestly, they don’t concern you. They aren’t taking viewers or money from you. Do you honestly think that a viewer who donates money to one of those channels would’ve donated to you instead? It’s two completely different markets. Forget about it.  
  

* Be comfortable with what you do and put on your channel  
    * Do you feel comfortable monetizing your channel to the fullest with donation notifiers, donation tickers, sub goals, donation messages, affiliate links in your title? Great, go for it. Comfortable acting like a maniac? Awesome, do it. There’s nothing inherently wrong with it. I personally don’t do either, but that’s a personal thing. As long as you’re comfortable (and it doesn’t break TOC) it’s fine. Be prepared for backlash, though, as some people may find it distasteful. Weigh the pros and cons and come to your own decision. 
  

* It’s a lot harder than you think it is  
    * It’s never easy, but usually it’s a ton of fun.

2t96mb,Was Swatted -- Word of Warnings,"Was just swatted on my stream, it's a small stream and never had to deal with it before. The person followed with my name, and then with my address, and then with ""Hey Swat's coming"" or something like that. I brushed it off but after Domino's showed up at my house I called 911 and the dispatcher seemed audibly shaken once I said I thought I was being swatted.  

She just kept telling me ""It is very good that you called"".  

Having 8 or 9 cops in uniform or tactical gear walk through your house is a humbling experience, I am just now afraid of the safety of myself, my wife, and my dog. Any one of us could have been shot.  

I'm rattled, to say the least. Just wanted to remind you all if you ever get the feeling that you are going to be swatted, CALL 911 RIGHT AWAY!!! If I had waited another 5 minutes I would not be talking to you right now, and my dog might be dead.

Twitch admins, if you could help me with information on several accounts that were created, I know the police would really love that information. Throwaway obviously but I will check it occasionally.  

Stay safe, twitchers.  

---

**EDIT:** Thanks for the support all. To answer some repeating questions:  

1. Pretty sure they got my address from a domain name registration. Most hosts provide Domain Privacy services, so contact yours so your information is not out there, or register your domains to a PO box.  
2. Get a PO Box. I will never again use my personal address for anything online. It's costing me $50 for the year but that's worth it.  
3. Calling ahead probably saved us from damage, and probably saved my dog's life (SOP for most swat teams is to shoot dogs, as they can be hostile). If you have ANY inclination you might be targeted **CALL 911 RIGHT AWAY!!!**  
4. I will continue streaming, but only after all my affairs are in order. Yes I am worried about that singular troll coming back and my information out there but I am working with police to try and prevent this from happening again. Not going to let this stop me, but it does give me pause.  

**EDIT The Second:**  

1. Called the police, they are treating this as seriously it seems. There will be action on their part hopefully.  
2. Now that it's happened, my home will hopefully always be a call-first or knock-first home, according to the several officers I have talked to since.  
3. I have obliterated all connections of my personal and streaming life, bought a PO box, privatized all my domains, and will be refraining from posting anything identifiable for a while. Going through and making all personally connected social media private while going through web-related profiles and removing anything that can lead to me. I got lazy I guess having been online so long, I won't make that mistake again.

2t5ulf,The 1080p 60fps hype train and why it's just one big crazy train.,"I don’t know why it’s becoming the new best thing to do - but it’s really not the best thing to do. Pick either 1080p or 60fps, not both. Streaming in 1080p 60fps is in most cases unneeded (I saw a 1080p 60fps Runescape stream the other day…..) but INSANELY demanding on not only your computer, but also the viewer.

Reasons to not stream in 1080p60fps:


**Viewer requirements:**

Most everyone understands that when you stream, your broadcaster encodes the frames then sends them to Twitch servers for them to be streamed. But, also at the same time when someone is watching the stream, they have to decode those frames, if 1080p 60fps requires such an insanely powerful computer, just imagine what it takes to decode those frames. Live streaming is a lot different than just watching a movie on your computer at 1080p 60fps. That can buffer, up to many minutes in advance, live stream, you decode that frame the moment you get it, which is 60 full 1920x1080 frames, any average grade computer will have a hard time watching this. I have a laptop with a quad core and decent video card. It’s by no means a gaming laptop or high end laptop, but it’s also not a piece of crap, I’m able to play any game on average settings, if you stream in 1080p 60fps, you force those settings to be “Ultra” practically. When I’m watching one of those 1080p60fps streams, my CPU usage goes to 50% literally all from Chrome, and all from Shockwave (aka, the stream)

**It’s not needed most of the time:**

Do you really need 60 full 1080p frames for your game? Most likely not. It’s just unneeded most of the time I see it. Unless people are full screening the stream (which, most people don’t so they can use chat) the video is downscaled anyway, so no one unless they’re fullscreening it will be able to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p.

**Extreme broadcasting requirements:**

Probably if you’re streaming in 1080p 60fps, you have the computer to handle it. But, since it’s 1080p 60fps, you need INSANELY high bandwidth. It’s a somewhat known fact that we extremely discourage anyone broadcasting above 3500kbps, and if you’re streaming 1080p60fps, you about need to use all 3500 of those kbps.

**Mobile viewers:**

If someone’s watching on their phone, odds are their phone can’t decode full 1080p60fps without lagging, and even if they have the insane quad core phones from Japan that aren’t sold in the US, data usage. You’ll need the 3500kbps for video, and also audio bitrate you’ll probably be having extremely excessive too, like at 320kbps, but I’ll just say 160kbps, so 3620kbps. 3620kbps is roughly .5MB/s, so in 1 minute it’ll use 30MB, after 10 minutes it’s 300MB, and after 30 minutes it’s 900MB, if someone has only 1GB plan, your 1080p60fps stream just about ate their entire plan in 30 minutes. Even if you have unlimited data, when is 4G ever consistently the same speed? It’s wireless over a cellular data network, not wired. (inb4lol i use wifi arguments)

**Okay, I have transcoders though because I’m partnered:**

Not the solution. Transcoders do not scale with your settings as of yet. In fact, high is actually ~1200kbps at 720p. So even high quality is pretty bad. It’s taking your 3500kbps stream and scrunching it into 1200kbps 720p, aka, you’re now streaming 1080p60fps at 1200kbps.




**Okay, I won’t stream in 1080p60fps anymore. What settings should I use?**

First, what game are you playing? Really depends on the game you’re playing. If it’s a game with really high definition graphics like WoW or Dark Souls or other games like that, you might want to go 1080p30fps - you’ve successfully just cut the frame encoding and decoding requirements in half. You might even be able to lower your bandwidth now too. If it’s a game like Hearthstone, Runescape, or other games without high resolution graphics, you could go 720p60fps. Some of the best quality streams I’ve seen have been 720p60fps, and I highly recommend that option because of the argument the player is downscaled when it’s full screened, no one would be able to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p.



Basically, that. I made this post because I’ve seen so many people in the new year start changing their stream settings and building new PC builds to stream in 1080p 60fps, and it’s actually not a good idea, at all. Whenever I look at a new stream and see a 1080p 60fps stream I immediately back out of it because it’s just that severely taxing on me.

TL;DR: Don’t stream in 1080p 60fps. Pick one, not both.

Edit: Already got reddit gold for this. Thanks for whoever did, but, give it to someone else that uses reddit more than me. I barely use reddit, it would be a lot better in someone elses hands.

Edit2: Another example of how a stream can look when your computer can't handle decoding it, but the streamer can encode it just fine, here's a 4K 60FPS stream that's dropping 0 frames: http://www.twitch.tv/commanderroottest

2rjtym,An honest (and optimistic) discussion about channel growth.,"If you have spent any time here on /r/Twitch then you've seen many, many posts asking the question, ""is my channel growth good?"" then the OP proceeds to detail how long they have been streaming and what their current follow and concurrent viewers counts are.

The common thread in all these threads is the general response is that there is no general response to these kinds of question. I firmly believe that everyone's stream will grow at vastly different rates for vastly different reasons. Time slots, games chosen, networking, luck are just a few of the factors that will come into play when trying to parse out the growth of any single individual channel.

So what's the point of this post, you ask? This isn't a reinforcement of the ideas above, but more so my thoughts on a kind of ""goal"" all streamers can aim for when it comes to any form of ""expected"" growth. 

It all breaks down to converting *one true fan a week*.

For anyone familiar with the 1,000 True Fan Theory **([Found here](http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/)**) this might ring a bell. At its core the 1,000 True Fan theory states that an artistic endeavor can be supported if there are at the very least 1,000 people who are life-long fans. 

Obviously the validity of the 1,000 True Fan Theory can be disputed, and the author agrees, but I believe there is some basis for it and the pursuit of those ""1,000 Tue Fans"" led me to a realization about stream growth that put all my efforts into perspective.

You'll get to a point  when you realize how ""worthless"" the follower count truly is. Don't get me wrong, having a high follower count most certainly has its perks, but overall it does very little to serve as a gauge of how you are doing as a streamer. Our stream has almost 15k followers, but at best we'll get viewer counts ranging from 120-250 (game depending).

That means we are getting a little over ***1%*** of our follower count in terms of concurrent viewers. What I would give for  a consistent ***2%*** or dare I even dream, ***3%***. From what I've seen of streamers of similar size - this is a common ratio. It's because a *follow* is the easiest thing a Twitch viewer can ""give"" to a streamer. There is no consequence to a viewer throwing a follow to a stream they will never go to again, even more so if the account was made for a giveaway; if you are a streamer that advertises frequent giveaways expect an even greater threshold between follows and concurrent viewers.

The overall point of above is to emphasize that your focus should always be on the viewers you have in your stream *right now* and not the top end viewer count you could theoretically get if every single person who ever followed you were to just come back (it's never going to happen).

This is why as a streamer I focus on converting viewers into True Fans and from what I've seen if you can convert one True Fan a week then you have a shot at making it as a streamer.

That said, keep in mind this isn't a get famous quick strategy. There are 52 weeks in a year and if you manage in one year of streaming to convert a true fan a week then you have 52 viewers who will stick with you. In terms of ""making it"" as a streamer you are still way off in terms of financial stability. As others have mentioned on the subreddit - streaming isn't a sprint it's a marathon. You have to be in it for the long haul - because you love it.

52 True Fans in one year is, I feel, a very conservative estimate. And keep in mind your first year will be difficult since the lower amount of exposure you have the harder it is to convert people. You might go a few weeks where you don't convert anyone, and then you might hit a week where you convert tens of people. As is with TwitchTV, growth is exponential and things come easier the more people are present in your stream. Keep them around and start to disregard your follower count entirely.

Let's take our stream for example, OverBored Gaming. Come February 25th we'll have been streaming for 2 years. I imagine our follower count might be around 15,500 then and our common concurrent viewer counts will still be around 120-250. We've had the opportunity to convert 104 true fans in the past 2 years of streaming, and by going subs and concurrent viewers I feel we're more or less on track with my estimates. 

Don't get me wrong - it's hard work to impress another human being enough to want to spend their time with you everyday, especially people as discriminating in tastes as internet users. But it's possible - it really is. 

I just wanted to provide some semblance of metrics for you to follow, something to help you feel like you aren't totally in the dark when it comes to trying to measure if your growth is ""good.""

What I'm trying to say is your growth doesn't suck quite as much as you think it does :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2rjtym/an_honest_and_optimistic_discussion_about_channel/,1420576719.0,52,0.89,34,Twitch,Brawli55
2rb7x9,"Just hit 50,000 followers, here are some things that have worked for me","Hey guys, I just hit 50,000 followers, thought I'd make a post on whats worked on my channel.  Here's some background:  I've been streaming since May 2014, so its been about 8 months.  I average between 600-1100 viewers, depending on what I'm doing, and have around 450 subscribers.  I have a full time job and so I only stream a few hours a day, and I have no intentions of quitting my job to be a full time streamer.  I stream Clash of Clans.  This is stuff that has worked for me, but obviously results vary, since there is no real blueprint or one path.  I don't think I followed most of the advice I see in this subreddit, which doesn't mean its bad advice- just I took a different path.  I have no facecam, I stream at low quality 1K bit rate, my internet constantly crashes and lags, my overlay is cluttered, and I never got a schedule until after i was partnered.  Yet despite that, I've been pretty happy with the growth of my stream.  I'll try to talk about things that don't get brought up in every general help thread.

One thing that takes time to get used to is **working with the twitch delay**.  That roughly 20 seconds of delay makes having conversations challenging.  To establish a conversation flow, I try to ask my question up front, then I may speak about the topic for 20 seconds while monitoring chat for the response.  This made it sound alot more natural and less staccato.  My goal was to make the chat less a Q&amp;A, and more a conversation.  I try to address viewers by name as much as possible, and also try to read their question out loud or respond to it in a manner that the stream knows what question you are answering.  I also tried to memorize things about my viewers.  Even remembering simple stuff, like where they are from, gets people to come back.  I also make sure to ask questions to the chat- sometimes I see streamers just sit there and wait for people to ask them stuff, but I try to ask things back.  Need ideas on questions?  Check out the latest gaming news, and even questions on /r/games or /r/askreddit.

**I am a fan of giveaways.**  Most of the time when the topic comes up in this subreddit, streamers say they don't do giveaways because they don't like people just coming to the stream just for them, or if they do giveaways its only for the loyal viewers.  I have a very different view- giveaways are basically a form of advertisement.  They draw in more people, and while many might be there just for the giveaway, by having your stream towards the top of the game directory, the viewer count snowballs.  Giveaways are a tool to get you out of the bottom where so many streamers are stuck.  And by investing a few hundred into giveaways, its paid for itself many times over (now most my giveaways are sponsored so I don't have to pay for them).  I use a loyalty bot to handle raffles, which gets people wanting to return.  Even when I don't do giveaways, I see people return over and over again.  I honestly feel like some (not all) people in this subreddit advise against giveaways because the less streamers that do giveaways, the less competition they have, since with all things being equal, a random viewer browsing the directory will more likely click a stream with a giveaway, then without.  

**I think ""being yourself"" can be misinterpreted**.  I stream to entertain.  I am putting on a show for the viewers.  Think of it like going on a first date- you can be yourself, but you're also putting that extra into it to make the good first impression.  When I play games by myself, I'm pretty lowkey and chill.  But when I stream, I talk fast, get more excited/emotional, etc.  I am usually dead tired because I stream right when I get home from work, but I do not let it reflect in my voice.  Yes, I'm still myself...but being yourself doesn't mean you have to act the same way as when you play games solo.  Your tone of voice is very important- I find alot of streams I check out, they sound like they just smoked a blunt and are about to pass out.  I'm not saying you have to go MLG announcer all the time, but if you sound excited, its contagious to your viewers, and my goal as a streamer is to get the viewer emotionally invested in the game I'm playing.  This is especially true if you have no facecam (such as myself).  

**Watch  your viewer count**.  So often people advise to not even look at it, but I disagree.  I don't mean stare at it and stress about it and act miserable if its not that high.  But I do check it throughout the stream, to help gauge how I'm doing.  I make mental notes on what brings in more viewers, and what doesn't.  I also note what my stream title is, and also the time of day.  I'm always trying out different ideas on my stream, some are successful and some arent'.  Viewer count is just one tool at your disposal, its up to you to use that info.  Follower count is kind of useless (ironic considering the title) because followers doesn't really translate to concurrent viewers.

Anyways, that's whats worked for me.

Here's a VOD where he explains what happens (and announces his Pateron account): http://www.twitch.tv/lethalfrag/v/3620041

Basically - it appears that if you go and in any capacity state that your Amazon Affiliate link helps you, or supports the stream, that is a breach of the TOS.  We had our own Canadian Amazon Affiliate account terminated for the  exact reason Frag's was - because saying the link supported the stream ""provided incentive"" for use of the link - which is against the TOS. This was in reference to how we presented the link on our website.

At this point - if you want to promote your Amazon Affiliate Link, the best you can do is state that it exists and where it is (thought I'm not 100% sure about that so don't take my word as gospel about that).

Also don't forge to include the required legalize beneath the link that includes the phrasing, ""... affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising ...""

2ppe5l,Stream my electronic music for free with your game streams! Update on an older post,"Hello again, /r/twitch!

I posted here a few months ago at the request of /r/leagueoflegends, where I posted a link to [my Soundcloud account](http://www.soundcloud.com/avaren) offering anyone who wanted to stream my music with their game streams to do so for free.

I'm back again because I got my music onto the Free Music Archive (a website with a collection of Creative Commons-licensed media), and wanted to share again!

[Here is a link](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Avaren/Avaren/) to the album containing 10 royalty free songs that you can use with your streams. The music is licensed under a Creative Commons license that allows you to use the music *however* you'd like, so long as I'm credited. This means that even if you don't want to use it for streaming, but want to use it for a project (compilation video, side project, whatever!) feel free!

Thanks for being so supportive in the past, and I hope you enjoy this pack of free music! If you *do* decide to use any of my music for your projects, I'd love to see them!

2n7xrn,Twitch allows celebrities to pull PR stunts via streams - doesn't care about ToS violations.,"(Disclosure: I don't listen to them, but I thought it was interesting enough being a twitch viewer that they chose the platform, so I tuned in.)

So *SOME ARTIST YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF* announced a stream that started half an hour ago with the sole intention of promoting their music video. Apparently I can't name them here despite this thread having to do with Twitch itself.

On top of it all, it was a prerecorded ""countdown"" that ran for an hour to zero that did nothing but play their new song once finished, and then display a message telling people to go to their site. This message has been and is currently still up on the stream. There was nothing ""live"" about their stream, and nothing to do with ""gaming"".

Naturally, thousands were fooled into tuning in, and shortly after the report brigade began with everyone reporting it for ""Non-gaming content"" because this stream was a clear self endorsement - and it was obviously not gaming related in any shape or form.

What happens after HUNDREDS (if not thousands) of people report the stream for the next twenty minutes? **nothing**. Nothing happens.

In fact, **There are half a dozen Twitch admins in the stream itself, deleting messages left and right and banning people.**

If this is the precedent Twitch would like to set - that it's OK for famous people to fool others with their platform for shameless self promotion - then I'm going to move on to an alternate streaming platform for my *actual* gaming related stream needs.

: Mods are banning non english speakers in the chat for not being able to donate: And I quote "" No donations from people we cant understand""  I hope you understand sorry for the people out there. Which says "" if you are not an english speaker"" get out because you cant donate.

Her mods requested people donate to reveal her breast size, after multiple and i mean multiple hefty donations they revealed it to be 34kk which is equilivent to 1500cc of saline

Edit : just to be clear I am not a mod of this channel, In fact I was purged then banned for saying report after the ADULT MODS  WHICH are prob from her CAM SITE secretly  link dropped to her  ( inappropriate twitter ) by mistake.  THE MODS DID A MASS  BAN due to it being the top LEAGUE STREAM and people were threatening to report the channel due to the porn link drop from her mods. 

EDIT: She acknowledged  the mods dropped the wrong link and said no guys what did i tell you, she then told everyone to google search her Name and TWITTER. WTF? She Even has a twitter at the bottem of her panels which is the legit one. the gaming twitch only one. If you dig further it is disturbing.

: I am sorry if the start of this message is looking to coming off as an attack. I do not mean anything offensive to the streamer.  I AM not attacking woman at all. But this is a different story. The streamer IS playing the game but the thing is WE CANT SEE THE GAME. LITERALLY SHE IS 80% covering the game. AND her mods are fishing for the donations.

: She has a wonderful personality.

: Mods have reduced the camera to have it so its on the side.

TO everyone who is asking for the channel, Im sure you can find it on twitch. As for posting the link, That is against the tos for reddit. I WILL NEVER BREAK THE REDDIT CODE. That is immature and wrong. No witch hunting OR any violent acts.

2lcraq,PSA: Moderate Your Moderators,"I just left a stream without following despite the quality being great and the streamer being entertaining. Why? The moderators of his chat were extremely hostile and acting like 12 year olds. The worst part was that he didn't even seem to realize what was happening - he just assumed that his moderators were doing their job.

Streamers (including myself), please watch your moderators. Just because someone is your best friend in real life **does not** mean that they will make a good mod. I actually intentionally don't allow some of my best friends to be mods because I know that they would hurt the atmosphere of my chat.

If a mod is acting hostile to your viewers, call them out. They undoubtedly will make your viewers leave if they are unpleasant. A moderator does not deserve to be able to break the rules any more than a viewer.

Make sure your mods understand the rules of your channel. I've had my own mods ban people for things that were not bannable offenses as well as completely miss things that really deserved at least a timeout. Make sure they know the consequences for each offense - does trolling deserve a ten minute timeout or a permaban? Also, and **most importantly**, make sure that your mods **do not** ban for things that aren't against the rules. Being banned for disagreeing with the mod because the mod is too insecure to deal with disagreement or even (*gasp*) being wrong about something will make some viewers leave permanently.

Your mods should be your ideal viewers. They should know the rules and enforce them without being too harsh and should never be the reason someone leaves your channel.

Lastly, please, do not be afraid to deny someone moderator status or even *remove moderator status* from someone. If a mod misbehaves repeatedly, they should not be a mod. Just because someone has been a regular viewer since day one does not make them a good moderator. I've had to tell my most regular, enthusiastic viewers that they were not allowed to be moderators because I didn't think they would make a good mod. It might be tough to hear, but it's better to disappoint a viewer/mod or even permanently lose a viewer than appoint/keep a mod who will scare away tons of potential viewers.

This all really ties into one thing: pay attention to chat. People are in chat because they want to hang out with you, and if you ignore it, people are less likely to stay regardless of your mods. Also, paying attention in chat should help you notice if a mod ever misbehaves.

This is something really important that I felt had to be addressed since so many people seem to completely ignore it. I've been into multiple streams that I really liked aside from issues with their mods that unfortunately made it difficult for me to watch and participate in the channel. I do my best to run my streams and moderation team by these rules and I think it has helped a lot.

Also, for anyone wondering, I sent the aforementioned streamer a private message about what had happened, so we will hope we see some positive change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2lcraq/psa_moderate_your_moderators/,1415180644.0,58,0.91,13,Twitch,TeganGibby

2krclw,So when does the non-gaming crackdown start?,"[Image Removed] Because I'd love to see the crackdown start on streams portraying two drunk people attempting to make cupcakes / trying not to injure themselves with knives.

**Edit 1**: I removed the image because I'd much rather have the discussion than try to forward an image that anyone could most likely find. Here's the full story I want to talk about.

Late last night in the League of Legends category there was a streamer (not naming specifically because I'm not sure if name-dropping might be not allowed) that was not playing video games. This streamer, with about ~10k viewers, was very intoxicated and he and his girlfriend were baking cupcakes in his kitchen. There was zero gaming content on the screen. They were so drunk that when his girlfriend was using a knife, there were enough people worried that she might accidentally hurt herself. She also (which the image originally showed) showed herself in a brief moment in a not-so-PG way which would probably also not be seen favorably by TOS. I want to see Twitch put actions to their words.

Barring all the ""you're just jealous you dont have 10k viewers"" comments I'm going to get, I would just like to see Twitch enforce the shiny new TOS they've just put in place. It's less than pleasant for them to pick and choose where they enforce the TOS - everyone should be held to the same code of conduct and no one should get preferential treatment. 

**Edit 2:** I dont wan't them banned from Twitch. I'm not some asshole that wants people drawn and quartered at the slightest wrong. I just think if you're streaming non-gaming content, your channel should not appear in that game's category/section/list. Maybe we need an ""Other"" or ""Fan""/""Subscriber"" section for non-gaming streams that they can tag into when they're doing those kinds of streams as opposed to just saying in WoW or LoL when they're baking/knitting/whatever it is they're doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2krclw/so_when_does_the_nongaming_crackdown_start/,1414650342.0,69,0.86,143,Twitch,PensiveLionTurtle
2kkt4z,"In regards to ""showing cleavage for views"", from a professional streamer","For a quick snip, if you're unaware of who I am, I'm Destiny, one of the very first streamers on Twitch.TV (back then it was Justin.TV) and I've been streaming for a living for the past 4 years.

-----------------------------------

A lot of people get very upset at women who stream to show off cleavage (""that xxx girl streamer is a **whore**!!), or men who stream using silly voices (""fuck xxx and his stupid voices!"") or other gimmicks (""all xxxx does is give shit away all day and cry on stream omg!"").

The business of streaming is absolutely fucking brutal. It is the ultimate expression of ""free market"" combined with a healthy bit of cronyism going on as well. There is no minimum wage, there are no guaranteed hours, and no one is going to help you figure out your now absurdly complicated taxes. No one is going to help you with your marketing, no one will tell you how to communicate effectively with business partners, and no one will hand you sponsorships.

Want a website? Figure it out yourself. Want a custom subscription or donation system? Better know how to code, or else find someone to pay to set it up for you. Need artwork? I hope you can draw, or I hope you have a strong fanbase who doesn't mind producing free content.

Do you think there's some streamer that's absurdly popular, only because he's part of an ""old boys club"" or because he just happens to a friend of a popular Youtube star or current Twitch streamer? **Guess what, you're probably right.**

The point I'm trying to get across is that **streaming** (nothing in life, really...) **is NOT a meritocracy**. You are not rewarded by some third party for hard work, for keeping a schedule, for staying ""moral"", for adhering to some ""tenets of being a good streamer"" or for any other kind of behavior. At the end of the day, it all comes down to how many warm bodies you can convince to watch your stream. That's the ultimate determinate of your paycheck.

One of the most important steps to success that you can take is to realize that - in this wild west of streaming where the market is over-saturated as fuck and people who are putting dozens of hours a week in to stream while still barely managing to survive - everything is fair game, and whether or not you want to judge someone for the way they market themselves, it has no impact on your own performance.

If I were a woman who looked good, **I would 100% consider taking advantage of my appearance for more viewers**.

Let's look at a couple, basic facts that we can safely assume -

- The OVERWHELMING majority of viewers are male.
- Many of them are young

If you have two different streamers, Samantha and Jessica, and both of them were the exact same in regards to schedule, quality of play, quality of stream, communication with audience and entertainment quality, and one of them decided to show a little bit of extra cleavage or appear more physically attractive due to extra work on hair/make-up/etc..., they would absolutely get more viewers.

Again, to stress, **streaming is not a meritocracy**.

To address a few side things that may come up -

- ""But you're cultivating a different kind of viewerbase if you market yourself based on your boobs!""

**Yes and no**. Just because you appear attractive or market your physical features, it doesn't make you a bimbo or an airhead. You can use looks (or any other ""gimmick"") to get people in the door; you keep them there by being entertaining. A girl who markets her physical features, but is otherwise vapid/boring, **will not** retain viewers. She'll get a large surge in temporary popularity and then she will probably fizzle out.

- ""Showing cleavage just to get viewers is unfair! Girls can have an advantage over guys in that way!""

**Life is not fair.** You, as a guy, will never be able to successfully market your sex appeal (at least in the foreseeable future) on Twitch to get viewers. Women, however, also receive a lot of hate for said marketing, which isn't really fair as well. At the end of the day, an ""it's not fair!* argument holds no weight when you're talking about an industry that is inherently unfair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2kkt4z/in_regards_to_showing_cleavage_for_views_from_a/,1414511305.0,425,0.87,350,Twitch,NeoDestiny

2f77aw,How to become a Twitch Admin!,"Update: Since I wrote this post, a change has been made separating Global Moderators and Admins into two groups. They still work very closely together, but there are some differences! Please read [this blog post for details](http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/12/chat-update-new-global-moderator-role-and-badge/). **To become a Twitch Admin, one must first be a Global Moderator, and this post will describe the process of becoming one.**

Who doesn't want to be a Global Moderator? Moderator powers in every single channel, impossible to be timed out.. It sounds like a dream! For a lot of people, it is. It was, for me! So, the question is: How *do* you become a Twitch Global Moderator, and earn that shiny badge?

Before I get started, let me just state that no real process has ever been decided yet. Some of the current Global Moderator and Admin team got there because they were moderators on JTV, some built special projects in the early days of Twitch that made them essential to the team, while others were brought on after being recommended by other Global Moderators or Staff. There have been a variety of different ways to join the team, and I don't think all possible ways to join the team have yet been discovered. That means that everything in this post should be taken with a grain of salt. This is not an Instruction manual you can follow to the dot and suddenly expect a badge. These are tips and guidelines that I have personally found out myself, seen others do, or that I simply consider as good. Use them to the best of your ability!

***
**Global Moderators have a lot of power.**

As I stated earlier, Global Moderators have a *lot* of power. They are also privy to some insider information that could be used maliciously in the wrong hands. This means that Twitch are going to be very careful about who they add to the team. In most if not all cases of the current Global Moderators they have been vouched for personally by one or more of the other Global Moderators, Admins, or even Twitch Staff members. As many of you may have seen, an open application form was posted some time ago, but the truth is that not a single Global Moderator was added to the team through it, simply because a form like that is not enough to determine whether or not a person is trustworthy. In the future, Twitch are considering doing the applications through the [Twitch Jobs](http://www.twitch.tv/jobs) page, where an interview could establish such qualities in a person.

But outside of that, how would you normally earn the trust of Twitch? By getting your name out there. Make yourself known among the helpful Twitch resources. Answer questions on /r/Twitch. Volunteer by responding to support tweets tweeted at @TwitchSupport. Help out whatever community you can, in whatever way you can. Get yourself *noticed*.

Just like there are things you *should* do, though, there are things you *shouldn't* do. Do not 'collect' Global Moderators, Admins, or Staff on Skype/Twitter/Facebook. Never harass Global Moderators about the latest report you sent in, or the latest thread on /r/Twitch you responded in. Do not ask if there's a position open every single day. Never pretend to be a Global Moderator before you've been added in an attempt to show off. Don't go around warning broadcasters for breaking the rules, just report them and move on.

It's simple, really. Don't beg for endorsements; Earn them.

***
**Global Moderators are volunteers.**

That means that being a Global Moderator is not something you get paid for. Admins are those who are hired to do specific duties such as handling user reports among other things, but this is a position that only opens up for existing Global Moderators. Publicly, there is little difference between paid Admins and volunteer Global Moderators. (Personal note: Don't ask Admins how much they are paid. It comes off as kind of tacky!)*

***
**So what do Global Moderators actually do?**

Global Moderators are meant to be role models for the community. They are people who use the site personally, and as such are able to notice on-going issues or crisis early, which they can then report to the according venues. Global Moderators are also sometimes used as a focus group or as beta testers for new features, or simply look out for bugs while they use the site.

Outside of that, Global Moderators often bring some sort of unique skill to the team. Some are excellent at Community Management, while others are Programmers who can create tools or scripts. Some have deep knowledge of the video system, or some other technical side of Twitch. The basis is that there is no *exact* list of duties Global Moderators are expected to do, but rather, they are expected to do their best to make the site a better place in whatever way they can.

Please note that while Global Moderators do have moderator powers in all channels, they will *not* exercise those powers unless given express permission (and actually want to do it), or in special cases of emergency. They are not going to come into a channel and disrupt the already existing moderation chain!

***
**The requirements.**

Let's get down to business. What exactly do you need to become a Global Moderator?

1. **The correct mindset:** Being a Global Moderator is something you should do because you want to help make Twitch a better place. It is *not* something you should want to do because of the power, because it's a rare position, or because you want that shiny badge. If that is your mindset.. It's painfully obvious, and it means you're likely never going to become a Global Moderator.
2. **Common sense:** This one should be obvious.. but sadly, it is not. Being a Global Moderator means you're going to have to be able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes, being able to see things from more than a single angle, and to not be easily led along by scams or misinformation. Global Moderators have to stand in the middle of many various conflicts, and should be able to tell right from wrong, even when both sides are yelling at you to join them.
3. **Public relations skills:** Global Moderators do not officially speak for Twitch as a company, but the fact is that what Global Moderators do say will end up being seen as reflecting Twitch's stance on things. This means that Global Moderators need to be able to know what to say, when. As well as knowing when to shut up. If you want to be a Global Moderator, you should not be easily dragged into an argument. You need to be able to step aside, keep your head cool, and act professionally. Of course, the degree to which you need to be able to do this varies depending how much you interact with the public. Programmers rarely need to talk to the public, after all. Nonetheless, it is a quality all Global Moderators need to have to some degree.
4. **Bonus: Unique skills or languages!** These are not able to get you on the team by themselves, nor are they absolutely required, but they are great bonuses! If you have some unique skill that would help out the team, or know a language others don't, you'll be extra valuable.

2dz7ru,"Bitrates, Resolutions, and Quality.","Hello Streamers!

I'm Oremm, and I have been researching video encoding/compression and how it all relates to streaming on Twitch specifically.  You may have seen my previous [guide on stream development](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74GdLGbhU9k&amp;list=UUGEotsmB91ySJwGZeV8YFjA), or perhaps you have seen me here on the Twitch subreddit advocating quality over resolution.  In this guide, I hope to pass along some of what I have learned in a way that will be useful to streamers who are looking to produce high-quality visual presentation and maximize their potential exposure on Twitch.

Before I begin, I want to state two things:

* (1) This resource will not tell you what settings you need to use for your specs.  Everyone should put in their own work to determine what settings work best for them.  This guide *will* help you understand what you are doing when you make adjustments, so that your experimentation is more streamlined and yields better results.

* (2) This guide will be rather detailed and technical at points, and will be a long read.  No tl;dr, no shortcuts.

**I. Twitch.tv ToS: Ingest cap**

Twitch published a set of [broadcasting guidelines](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1253460) with their recommendations for bitrates at various resolutions.  You will notice that these recommendations stop at 3,500kbps.  That is because Twitch wants all broadcasts to be 3,500 or lower.  Going far over this cap is considered a violation of the Terms of Service, and grounds for a suspention or ban.  Even top-name broadcasters like DansGaming have been informed that they must abide by these limits.  As for the recommendations themselves, you may have noticed (if you tried them out) that they are not adequate for producing a quality image in high-motion games, particularly anything using a first-person perspective.  

**II. Network Traffic Management**

No doubt you have experienced buffering yourself, or heard complaints from others who are experiencing it.  Why does this happen, even when people are on a high-speed internet connection?  The answer is Network Traffic Management (NTM), which almost every Internet Service Provider (ISP) uses to some degree.

**A. What IS it?**

NTM takes many forms, but the common element is that information packets are limited in how/when they can pass through.  These practices are called ""throttling"" by many, but if you want to get into the technical details of NTM, I recommend starting on the [wikipedia article for packet shaping.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_shaping)

**B. How severe/widespread?**

OK, so ISPs will slow down traffic.  How much?  What ISPs do it?  Lucky for us, Netflix is also struggling with being limited on many connections, and they collect data on it every month.  View charts for [USA](http://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/usa) [UK](http://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/uk) [EU](http://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/norway).  You will see that in general, the US gets the worst of NTM - probably due to the large amount of traffic the US produces.

**C. What can/should I do?**

The only sure-fire way to ""beat"" NTM is by low-balling, or aiming below the cutoff.  To that end, consider what the audience might be dealing with in terms of their ISP.  In the US, most areas have only 1 or 2 ISP choices, usually because local laws enforce a monopoly to avoid having their streets overrun with cables from competing companies.  So if you are causing people to buffer due to streaming over their ISP's cutoff - you could be excluding entire CITIES from being able to view your stream.  It's worth noting that while most ISPs do little to no NTM on upload traffic, some do.  If you have problems with your internet being cut off after a certain length of time streaming, or notice that frames start to drop, you might be experiencing NTM on your end.  In either case, the best answer to NTM is lowering the bitrate at which you stream.

**III. Resolutions**

**A. Definition**

In terms of watching a video on your computer, ""resolution"" refers to display resolution, or image size.  *Resolution only affects the size of the picture, not the clarity of the picture itself.*  Now, that is not to say that a smaller image and a larger one are equivalent, they are not.  Higher resolution images afford you greater viewing distance, among other benefits.  But it is wrong to think that ""quality"" only exists in high-resolution images.

**1. Display Resolution vs. Pixel Density**

Display Resolution is the sizing at which you view something.  How clear/sharp the image is to you depends on the pixel density of the monitor you are using.  Take 2 monitors.  Both are 1080p in Display Resolution.  One is 23'', one is 24''.  The 23'' monitor has a higher pixel density - each pixel it displays is slightly smaller.  If you look at the same exact picture on both - the 23'' screen will appear ""sharper"" due to the pixels being closer together.  Pixel density is calculated: (sqrt[pixelwidth^2 + pixelheight^2 ])/diagonal-in-inches.

**B. Image Fidelity**

Image Fidelity is a concept used when reproducing a compressed image.  Since livestreaming requires encoding and compression of a source image, there are going to be varying levels of faithfulness to the source, or fidelity.  Poor compression, or failure to dedicate sufficient bitrate to the encoding, will lead to low image fidelity.   A good standard for image fidelity is a minimum of 0.1 bits-per-pixel.  There is a formula for determining the bitrate needed to achieve this standard depending on the image size (resolution) and framerate of your stream.

**1. A simple 0.1 BPP formula for the x264 codec**

To find the bitrate at which you produce an image with 0.1bpp of fidelity, use this formula:

* (pixel width * pixel height * frames-per-second * desired fidelity) / 1,000

**THIS IS ONLY FOR THE x264 CODEC**

My testing has found that this formula is something of a ""break point"" in the cost/benefit ratio for image fidelity. Additional bitrate (above 0.1bpp) appears to yield diminishing returns.  EDIT: Further consideration suggests that the formula is simplified, representing a line where the actual values lie on a curve.

Conversely, if you want to find out the fidelity of a particular bitrate (perhaps if you are on limited upload), you calculate this way:

* (bitrate * 1000) / (width * height * fps) = BPP

**IV. Bitrates and Encoding Presets**

**A. Baseline (using 0.1bpp)**

I have recorded several video clips as companion pieces to this guide, which has been mostly theory until this point.  Unless otherwise noted, these videos are all encoded at bitrates calculated by using the 0.1bpp formula.

**B. Examples**

**1. High-motion (Action, FPS)**


This type of game is the most demaning - fast motion, first-person perspective.  It is a good example for why 0.1bpp is needed.

**VERY IMPORTANT!  DO NOT WATCH FROM WITHIN DROPBOX!  DOWNLOAD THE FILES TO YOUR PC!**

All examples were recorded at 1920x1080, downscaled using Lanczos filter in OBS.

* a. [540p (960x540), 30fps, 1600kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6uytfr3cabsfu10/1PS%20540p%20at%2030fps%201600kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - This is the lowest step I recorded.  We will compare other settings to this.

* b. [540p, 30fps, 1600kbps, Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gdxtbh0folgxu2y/1PS%20540p%20at%2030fps%201600kbps%20Fast.mp4?dl=0) - Comparing this to the previous, it appears that there was not much gained with a slower preset.

* c. [540p, 60fps, 3200kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mvvsmpnqozn3305/1PS%20540p%20at%2060fps%203200kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - Going up to 60 frames-per-second *with the requisite bitrate increase* makes a huge difference.  This video is much clearer than the previous steps, but requires a very high bitrate, near the 3500 cap.

* d. [720p (1280x720), 30fps, 2000kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/looqy2sbohhfus6/1PS%20720p%20at%2030fps%202000kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - The ""Golden Point"" compromise between quality and accessiblity.  (Not using 0.1bpp) While it's true that this image is higher in resolution than any of the 540p options, the image fidelity simply does not compare.

* e. [720p, 30fps, 2800kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5d8b915i6kb56nv/1PS%20720p%20at%2030fps%202800kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - 720 resolution with the requisite bpp value.  As with the 540/60 option, the bitrate is becoming an issue.  This is
comprable in quality to the 540/30 video, only larger.

* f. [720p, 30fps, 3500kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0awvegg4wi80nbw/1PS%20720p%20at%2030fps%203500kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - Evidence for [diminishing returns](http://imgur.com/EIiY9Ul) when exceeding 0.1bpp.

* g. [720p, 60fps, 3500kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zcb7rmccpnkh28/1PS%20720p%20at%2060fps%203500kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - This is the limit of Twitch's ingest.  While this video does represent a step up from the 30fps example,  there is still a little bit of loss in the image.

* h. [720p, 60fps, 5600kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t82o0xq6ijbug6t/1PS%20720P%20at%2060fps%205600kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - Here we go.  When using the correct bpp value you can *clearly* see the jump up in picture fidelity over the previous example.

* i. [1080p, 30fps, 3500kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yp9u102laer3ifp/1PS%201080p%20at%2030%20fps%203500kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - Weighing in at only 0.03bpp, this video shows the limitation of Twitch's ingest cap.  1080p simply will not work for motion-heavy games.

* j. [1080p, 60fps, 3500kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp2wc86y8t1sbqq/1PS%201080p%20at%2060fps%203500kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - 0.015bpp.  Unacceptable.

* k. [1080p, 30fps, 6000kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ukk79rq8rhupli5/1PS%201080p%20at%2030fps%206000kbps%20VFast.mp4?dl=0) - Using the correct bpp calculation, We can obtain the same *quality* of image seen all the way down at 1600kbps (540/30), only bigger.

* l. [1080p, 60fps, 13000kbps, Very Fast](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8hd4wjaekgrkpgz/1PS%201080p%20at%2060fps%2013000kbps%20VFast%20Frames%20Dropped.mp4?dl=0) - My poor CPU couldn't quite encode all the frames at this insane bitrate.  What got encoded looks great, but reaching this mark (0.1bpp) for TRUE 1080p is completely out of the question without a second, dedicated streaming PC.

**2. Low-motion (Hearthstone/Magic/etc.)**

Games where large portions of the screen are static require much less by way of bitrate.  You can calculate the acceptable bitrates by determining how much of the screen remains static.  Let's take Hearthstone as our example.  Almost 2/3 of the screen does not change (the sides and some of the center board make no changes at all), so using only 0.06bpp will give you the same results as 0.1 for high-motion games.  The new formula for finding the bitrate:

* (pixel width * pixel height * frames-per-second * 0.06) / 1000

So a 720p/30fps Hearthstone stream would be:

* (1280 * 720 * 30 * 0.06) / 1000 = 1659kbps

Similar calculations can be applied to games where only a small portion of the screen is involved in movement, such as in classic games where the character moves around the screen but the background remains still.

**V. Conclusion**

This guide is not a singular answer for everyone.  These principles and guidelines are meant to serve only as a starting point for your own experimentation.  Everyone will be demanding slightly different things of their rigs, and have different goals.  Take some time to fine-tune your settings to your own liking.  Hopefully this resource helps you figure out which aspects you would like to adjust.  Your comments and feedback are greatly appreciated - I will try to keep this guide up-to-date, especially when new technology becomes available.

**Struggling with Channel Growth on Twitch.tv**
Hello my name is Dan from Dansgaming on Twitch.tv and I’m a small broadcaster. You may immediately say but you’re not small at all, you get thousands of viewers a day. If we ignore the viewer count, what makes me different from a channel with only 100, 40, or 10 viewers a day? The answer is not much. At best the only thing I have that small channels don’t are two very important things: Experience and Time.

Time is my biggest advantage, I’ve been broadcasting for 5 years. I started from nothing and 5 years later I’ve built up my stream. Take those 5 years away and I’m you, I’m a small broadcaster trying to entertain people. In fact lets take away the adjective, I’m just a broadcaster.

I’m going to share with you some lessons I’ve learned over the past five years that may hopefully help you become a better broadcaster.

**DIFFERENT CHANNELS GROW AT DIFFERENT RATES**

- Many broadcasters give up after not seeing a large amount of growth on their channel after a couple years of streaming not realising that this is the norm. Growing fast is not common, it’s very rare in fact. There are tens of thousands of streams on twitch and in the past few years only a handful have been those overnight successes.

- Some channels grow slowly, some a bit faster than others, some seem to be overnight successes. Your channel could be anywhere on the spectrum, but since you’re reading this I’ll assume you’re a slow growing channel. You might be surprised but my channel is a slow growing stream

- Growing slowly can suck, you want to be that stream on the top of the channel page, but your growth is so slow sometimes that it feels like you’re stuck in a loop of no growth for months on end. I too have been through this, imagine if I had given up at year 2 with less a hundred viewers a day?

**JEALOUSY TOWARDS MORE SUCCESSFUL STREAMS**

- This is one of the hardest things to deal with. There will always be someone that does more in less time, someone who has more viewers than you, someone that just seems to get all the attention, love and support of twitch staff, etc.

- This is not a reflection on you &lt;- Hard, hard lesson. I still struggle with this even. It’s something you will always have to battle.

- When someone gets more viewers in less broadcasting time. It can make you feel inadequate, jealous, angry that twitch is helping to promote this person, helping someone who is already successful.

- Due to the right timing, game choice, another broadcaster going offline at the right moment, grabbing the attention of a staff member by chance, etc. these people may have gotten a boost that you just haven’t gotten yet but very well may if you are patient and don’t stop streaming.

**GROWING A FANBASE TAKES A LONG TIME**

- If you are starting from scratch it can take you years to build up to even a few hundred viewers on average each day.

- People don’t know who you are, let them get to know you. Your focus should be on building regulars. Regulars are what push your channel to the top of the page. 

- Talk to them, engage them get to know them. Make them want to come back. 

- **Your focus should not be on viewer counts composed mostly of random passerbys, but on the number of regular viewers you get.** Those people that come to your stream each day. Those are the secret to success on twitch. 

- **FOCUS ON THE VIEWERS YOU HAVE NOT THE VIEWERS YOU DON’T.** Focusing on what you don’t have makes the stream less enjoyable for yourself and those who actually are wanting to be entertained by you.

**YOU ARE NOT THEM, BE YOURSELF**

- The most successful streamers aren’t imitating other successful streamers, they are being themselves. 

- You have your own personality, use it to your advantage. It’s the one thing you have that other people don’t. When two broadcasters are broadcasting the same game, at the same time, with the same stream quality the only thing differentiating them is their personalities.

- There is room on twitch for everytime of personality, soft spoken, quiet types to the loud and proud types of people. Be yourself there is a fanbase for everyone out there.

These are some lessons I’ve learned as a broadcaster that started from nothing and never had any help from anyone to promote or grow my stream. My stream’s success is the result of quite simply streaming for YEARS even during the times I thought I’d never get any more viewers. I have always streamed the games I enjoyed playing even if those games would get me less views because they are “boring to watch”

Do not give up, what you’re experiencing is normal and will always be a part of your channel even when you have thousands of viewers a day.

I hope you enjoyed this quick write up and If you enjoyed it or It helped you let me know.

2d6023,How to put your actual heart rate/pluse on screen,"Hey guys - once in a while I'll do a broadcast where my heart rate/pulse is live on the screen. Could be a horror game, intense PvP Dark Souls match, lie detector test for local guests, etc - it doesn't take too much to get my heart rate up. While it is kinda faddy, I think its coo and some viewers seem to dig it. Here's an old embarrassing vid as an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5JvacS3cb0

**See the updated method at the end of this post, its way better**

I get asked a lot on how I do it, so figured I'd share here:

* All you need is a USB Pulse Oximeter that will give a live read on your current heart rate on your monitor, so you can capture it using Xsplit or OBS. I use this one http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Finger-Pulse-Oximeter-Sofware/dp/B00B8L8ZXE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407695635&amp;sr=8-1&amp; - $42 bucks - no referral link here. 

* Install the included software, you'll only need the red SP02 shortcut - that software displays your pulse info live. 

* Next connect the oximter via USB to your computer. I use windows 7, so I can verify it works there. 

* Then clip that puppy on a toe or finger and power it on. I clip it onto one of my toes (least obtrusive for me, but will work on fingers of course, but also your ear lobes. Try elsewhere at your leisure, haha).

* I then load up SPO2 on my computer and screen cap the heart icon and heart rate. I have Xsplit remove the black using the chroma key tool. I'll screen cap the rate and the beating heart individually so I can position them the way I want. 

Now the biggest downsides to this for me is that when I move my feet too much, the meter loses connection and it disappears from the screen till it grabs it again. Might be less of an issue for you, if unlike me, you're less prone to stomp your feet like a 3 year old when you lose or freak out. 

I have explored other stuff, but nothing better than the above so far. There are Polar straps that I use at the gym so that the running machine or whatever grabs my heart rate. That thing would be perfect since it'd never lose connection - but I have not found any device or software that will give me a live feed on my PC screen. 

Anyway - I bet you guys will come up with some other creative uses for this, or just make it plain sexier. Would love to hear feedback if you've got it! 

**UPDATE**: FerretBomb suggested a device below that works with a Polar heart rate monitor, so I snagged it and gave it a shot. Works like a charm, thanks Ferret! So why go this route? The big benefit of this is it's a wireless connection between a strap you wear around your chest and the receiver - so it's a lot less prone to being disconnected. 

Here are the deets:

* Get the device here, its like 60 bucks: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8661
* Get the polar strap here, its like 40 bucks: http://www.amazon.com/Polar-T31-Coded-Transmitter-Belt/dp/B000ARDPPU/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408060881&amp;sr=8-7&amp;
* Get the drivers here: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm
* Get the app here: http://danjuliodesigns.com/sparkfun/hrmi.html

Another nice thing about it is that the app offers the ability to show RAW data or an AVERAGE. RAW will jump around a bit, but it seems to be more ""up to the moment"" - and Average will... yeah, show an average.. a more smooth progression as you get more nervous. RAW might be better for jump scares, and AVG better for extended periods of stress. But this could just be me trying to sound smart, give it a shot on your own! Good luck!

2cv4oi,I work in the industry and may have a little insight on this new Twitch copyright system.,"I’ve seen a lot of talk about YouTube ruining Twitch since they announced their new copyright muting system for VODs. I work at a tech company that deals with lots of user generated content and I think I have some insight on the matter. Anything I say in here is purely my own analysis and opinion. I have no inside information from Twitch on the matter and I am not a lawyer.


First, let us start with a little background on the music industry. They do not fuck around with copyright. Many companies that have tried to skate by on grey areas of copyright law have been sued by the music industry for millions or even billions (or laughably even trillions) and subsequently bled to death during the lengthy and expensive legal proceedings. If your business has anything to do with music asking for forgiveness is NOT easier than asking for permission.


As much as we’d like to argue that the use of music to supplement a video stream that consists mainly of gameplay is fair use, the music industry will never see it this way. They will do everything they can to squeeze every penny out of their content and there is no avoiding that fact. They’re very familiar with this strategy and almost always get what they want.


Twitch was sitting on a time bomb. It was only a matter of time until the music industry sued them for billions of dollars and I’m surprised they got by for so long without it happening. There is no question that they had received many threatening letters and have been scrambling to appease the industry for some time. This is an extremely difficult situation for Twitch considering how unpredictable the courts can be on these issues. The only reason they weren’t sued is probably because they promised a system such as this; possibly with a release deadline. If it had ever come to Twitch being sued they may have very likely lost or gone out of business due to the high cost of years of lawyering that would follow.


Many people are blaming YouTube for ruining Twitch, and it may be true that YouTube was the main motivator behind the implementation of this system. It may have even been the primary motivation for Twitch agreeing to be bought out by YouTube. They could either spend millions building out an entire fingerprinting and takedown system on their own, or be bought by YouTube and use the extremely powerful tools YouTube already has. Whether they were ever bought by YouTube is irrelevant. A system to appease the music industry was necessary to Twitch’s survival. The alternative of fighting a long legal battle was just too risky to wager their entire business on.


Obviously a better solution than muting large sections of VODs would be to pay for the music that was played. I won’t go into detail about why this is an extremely difficult thing to do in Twitch’s case, but it is very possible that this is currently in the works and will come in the future. 


Many people have also been looking for an alternate service for everyone to move to. This is definitely not a solution to the problem. Any startup streaming service would be much more quickly bullied out of existence with a lawsuit than Twitch could ever be.


**TL;DR**

This is not Twitch’s or YouTube’s fault. It is the music industry. Be mad and yell at them instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2cv4oi/i_work_in_the_industry_and_may_have_a_little/,1407395419.0,123,0.84,137,Twitch,shoobyshoobertson

26s9y7,I'm developing software to stop lag/buffering,"**TL;DR**

I made a program that should fix the lagging when you watch unpopular twitch channels.

**Description**


Hello!

Basically as the title says I'm developing a program that will stop the lagging and buffering that happens usually every 4-5 seconds when watching low viewer count streams and I need some testers and people to report any issues or any problems and perhaps suggestions too.

You should consider this program as early alpha stage and there will definitely be some issues, but I'm planning on fixing everything obviously.

You can **download it from http://tards.net/** and I'll update the change log when I release new versions.

Program comes with MPC-HC player.

Also, if any Twitch staff is interested then message me and I can explain how this is achieved and how to perhaps improve your services.

25wutf,Please Do Not Sellout to Google,"While it may only be a rumor, in my experience there is a grain of truth in rumors.


Google promoted a notoriously bad copyright enforcement protocol implemented last year with almost every game impacted.  Games ranging from Mario to Spelunky were flagged for copyright infringement despite having nothing beyond a couple sounds that sound similar.  The response has been less than enthusiastic about the problem as Google left the developers to fight on the media producer's defense, and some developers didn't even lift a finger to fight for the media producers.


What happens if Google were to take control?  Do they implement a draconian copyright feature of paying for the right to stream?  They could just as easily squelch every streamer for copyright infringement as they did for YouTube.


As part of my streaming group, we have a list of approved, banned and greylisted developers to stream content from based on their public statements/support or lack thereof.  We do this as a courtesy to some developers and as protest to others, and internally we make it very clear as to why we would never stream some games.  


Right now Twitch has been home to some great social experiments like the MLG and Twitch Plays Pokémon.  Unfortunately while we could see some improvements such as Google Hangout integration we would probably see some of these experiments find other distribution methods due to copyright concerns and ownership permissions.

257ctx,For new streamers: Talk!,"I really want to support newer streamers. So I choose a game I want to watch and scroll down to the streamers who have 0-10 viewers. 99% of the time the guys and girls are so boring to watch because they don't say anything.

I understand that you don't have a lot of people in chat, I understand that you think it looks silly when you talk like you would entertain 1000 people. But that's exacly what you need to do.

Talk! People want to know what you think about the game, why you make the decisions you make, they want to hear you comment on your gameplay. Music in the background is nice to fill the talking gaps but don't let the music do the work for you. YOU are the streamer I'm watching and if you want me to stay you'll need to entertain me and show me your personality. 

I stumbled across your stream because of the game you are playing - I stay for the personality I'm watching.

Some other things I noticed:

- Don't add a donation button with ~10 followers. It looks like you are only streaming for the sake of money

- Face cams aren't necessary (see Lirik for example) IF you talk a lot

- Don't fill 70% of the screen with overlays (you don't need a chat overlay with 5 viewers, it just eats up space)

- Do a test stream and then watch the stream afterwards to check your settings (audio &amp; video!)

- Giveaways don't help you in the long run

- Keep an eye on your stream every time you change the game. Sometimes games fuck up your stream and the viewers only see a black screen - if you have a few people in chat they'll tell you. But if you don't, you'll destroy every first impression of new viewers.

I hope it helps someone!

chrgqc,I made a OBS plugin for Closed Captioning using Google Speech Recognition,"I made a free OBS plugin that gives streams closed captioning via Google Speech Recognition API just as a standalone OBS plugin with no other tools needed and fully optional to viewers. 

It uses Twitch's built in caption support and works on livestreams and in VODs on PC and iOS, no Twitch extension needed. 

**Features**

  * Captions only when the microphone source is unmuted and active to ensure safety
  * Works live and in VODs, no Twitch extension required
  * Completely optional for viewers
  * Supports OBS delay
  * Requires no extra tools or website open
  * Supports many common languages with western character sets

**Notes**

* The caption delay is usually less than half a second and should not be noticeable to viewers.
* The plugin only captions the selected audio source when it's not muted and when it's used on the current active scene to ensure safety and avoid any captioning when the mic is muted for stream.
* Video players with caption support like VLC can also show captions on downloaded VODs if enabled.
* The speech recognition works reasonably well when normally talking to chat but it's still far from perfect and the caption quality can go down quite a bit when talking quickly or using ingame terms but generally it's still better than nothing and usually good enough to be useful.

**Known Issues/Downsides**

Requires OBS 23.2.1 (released June 15th 2019) or newer!

Does not work with SLOBS (Streamlabs OBS).

The Captions should be off by default for most viewers but Twitch does sometimes have them enabled for some viewers for unknown reasons so occasionally some will be confused on how to turn them off and might need it explained.

* On PC viewers can turn captions on and off using the CC button on the bottom right of the player.
* On iOS it's a system wide setting: `Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Subtitles &amp; Captioning -&gt; Closed Captions + SHD`

**Usage**

I's currently used by a couple partnered streamers already, here's an [example VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/456013239?t=06m03s) to see for yourself.

Like today, I had a regular come into my stream who I haven't seen for about a week. After asking where he had been he had told me that they were officially a new father of a little baby boy. We talked during the stream mostly about how excited he was about being a dad. Its not a face to face reaction but you could tell he was just really amazed about being a dad and talking about how beautiful his son was and how weird it was to have a child.

Obviously being so wrapped up in trying to talk with everyone else during stream because I cant talk with everyone at once; Later when i was finished  I sent him a little whisper basically just saying ""Hey I just wanted to say congratulations on you becoming a father. I'm sure you'll be a great dad just be there for him. Anyway in all seriousness congratulations. Hope to talk to you again soon."" Something along those lines.

I guess basically what I'm saying is Twitch really isn't about the numbers but the community of people you bring around to you.

cg4hen,Today I felt like a 'real' streamer,"Hello you lovely people!

So I recently started streaming again! I just finished week 1.

Today something amazing happened, a really nice milestone for me!

Someone who watched me yesterday and followed me came back today and was active in chat! I cant even really describe how amazing that feeling was when I saw a familar name in the chat :)

Im currently getting 3-8 viewers at any time and getting around 2-3ish follows per stream, Im pretty happy with the progress!

I even had someone new stay for nearly two hours! And another new one told he would come back on a different stream.

~~P.S. does anyone know how to stop the auto focus of the logitech c920 webcam?!~~

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Hello again! WOW! I did not expect such a good recption! This post blew up haha.

First of, thanks so much for the gold kind stranger!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I did not intend to link my twitch channel, since I didnt want to advertise it, or it taking away from my post. Also I didnt want to link my twitch with my reddit-account. But after some thought, it doesnt really matter.

&amp;#x200B;

So heres is the link in case anyone wants to check it out:

Edit 2: Im not allowed to link it. Im sorry.

cewlkw,Do most OBS users add additional gain to their audio sources? My streams are so quiet!,"Hi folks,

I've always had issues getting my audio levels right. I've always felt my stream's audio is quiet even after switching from certain mixers and software, etc.

I stream with a two computer setup and use OBS on my stream PC. I have a Babyface Pro mixer with an SM7B mic. I do use a Cloudlifter for the mic to give it some extra needed gain.

My audio sounds great through the mixer itself - levels are nice a loud. On my gaming PC, into which the mixer is directly plugged via USB, my mic audio levels sound fine, too. I can test my mic through Discord and it sounds nice and full at a good level.

When I move over to my streaming PC, though, the audio levels get lower. Specifically, OBS seems to make things quiet. I get the audio from the mixer to the streaming PC using ADAT digital cables, and so the quality of that connection is high. I can record my mic on the streaming PC, using Windows' voice recorder, and it sounds about the same as on my gaming PC. But, when I stream, using OBS, to Twitch, my stream is quiet. My mic is quiet, my game PC audio is quiet - the whole thing just feels a bit quiet when compared to other streams that I watch.

The audio levels on everything are basically at 100%. The Windows sound devices are all at 100%. The mixer has all the channels at 0 - which as I understand it is basically the same as 100%.

Do most folks add gain to their audio sources in OBS? Does streaming to Twitch just naturally make things quieter?

I can't tell how to get my stream to be louder. I can't seem to tell if these other streams I watch are just super loud, or if they're ""normal"" and I'm quiet. It's hard to get a frame of reference, I suppose. If I up the gain any more on my mixer then I'm just going to start blowing out the mixer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cewlkw/do_most_obs_users_add_additional_gain_to_their/,1563476091.0,267,0.98,72,Twitch,LegendaryMood
celnsc,"The new chat is, yet again, a change for the worse.","At this point I don't even know who's in charge of Twitch's UI design, but every single change is made nonsensically.

We had a decent chat, nothing crazy but hey, wasn't bad either.

Now we have a chat where:

* The viewer list got moved to a place where there's absolutely nothing else, why? wasn't OK to have it next to the settings? who designs a UI where each option is on a different corner?

* Things like slow mode are harder to see, honestly, I'm watching dansgaming right now and the 5 sec slow mode is on. I can barely see what the icon is, I know it's a turtle with a 5 just because I've seen it so many times already. The new one overlaps with the white bars and is almost impossible to see properly.

* The thinner input box looks weird when the slow mode bar is decreasing too, and makes it harder to click on it if you are doing something else.

* There's even a resize arrow that doesn't work, in fact, it doesn't do anything.

* EDIT: And this is fucking huge, if you keep one key pressed, like ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....."" it doesn't update the input box, in fact, if you press it long enough, it fucking freezes the whole stream. This is... I don't even know what to say. EDIT 2: It seems to do this at random for me, sometimes I reload and it does it, sometimes I reload again and it doesn't freeze while doing it. EDIT 3: After some testing, it seems to do this when my computer is under stress (gaming rig, so it's not exactly a case of the PC potatoing), but it NEVER happened before, so I assume the new chat is worse optimized, or more resource intensive, or who knows.

And what do we get in return? nothing, the chat is exactly the same but worse, well, there's a NSFW option most users will never use anyway, I hope at least this chat is more... stable? I don't know, something.

Honestly, it's getting tiring having to fix every single official update with 3rd party apps, default twitch right now looks like clown make up.

ccqwhf,5 Plugins To Upgrade Your Twitch Stream!,"#[FULL VIDEO GUIDE!](https://youtu.be/IWdk6hdwVPw)

#INTRODUCTION

If you've been streaming for a while and are looking for creative ways to make your Twitch stream look unique, there are a tonne of different tools available and skills you can learn. One of the easier ways to upgrade your stream is by using OBS plugins. OBS plugins are simple addons that you can install over OBS to add new features like new filters, effects or even just simple QOL improvements. We'll be going through 5 of my personal favorite plugins and what they do.  

If you've never installed an OBS plugin before, it's as simple as browsing for a plugin on the [OBS project website](https://obsproject.com/forum/list/obs-studio-plugins.35/), downloading it and unzipping it in your OBS installation folder (typically C:\Program Files\obs-studio).

**These plugins are only compatible with OBS Studio and will not working with StreamLabs OBS (with the exception of the fourth plugin we'll be looking at, that works in SLOBS)**. With that being said, I've curated a list of 5 plugins that I think are useful for just about anyone.

#MOTION EFFECT

[Motion Effect](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/motion-effect.668/) is a plugin for animating scenes and sources. You might be familiar with OBS' default scene transition like the fade transition or the luma wipe transition. Motion effect adds a new transition that allows sources such as your game capture or webcam to actually grow or move across the screen between scenes. It also allows you to set a hotkey to animate a single source. If you've ever wanted to have your webcam slide on and off the screen, or have your webcam grow to fill the screen, Motion Effect allows you to do this.  

I've made a full written guide for using Motion Effect [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/byz2ha/guide_animate_your_stream_with_motion_effects/) if you are interested.

#REPLAY SOURCE

[Replay Source](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/replay-source.686/) allows you to set a hotkey that will instantly replay the last 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds (or whatever duration you want) of your stream. You can replay just a single source like your webcam or your game or you can replay your entire stream layout. You can set a replay to loop or end after a single playback.

#STREAM EFFECTS

[Stream Effects](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/stream-effects.578/) adds a set of filters and effects that you can apply to any source. You can add features like 3D transform (for manipulating any source in 3D space), drop shadows, outlines and (my favorite) a blur filter. It also adds a new type of source called *Source Mirror*, which allows you to make a copy of any other source. The reason you would want to use this is if you wanted to apply filters to one instance of a source (e.g. your camera) without affecting every other instance of that source. For example, you can apply a color key filter on your camera for one scenes but not on another scene. Stream Effects is by far my most used plugin.

#REAPER PLUGINS

[Reaper Plugins](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/) is a suite of free *VST plugins*. If you don't know what those are, they are plugins that are used to manipulate audio and are typically used to improve the quality of your microphone. It includes plugins for EQ, compression, noise gates and noise reduction. If you've ever wanted to increase the bass/treble in your voice, compress your audio so you have more consistent microphone levels (for you screamers out there), get rid of background noise etc. Reaper Plugins are the best free VST plugins I've found that include all these tools.

Note that this isn't like the rest of the plugins on this list. Make sure to install Reaper Plugins to the default folder location as OBS searches your C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins folder for VST plugins.

#OBS TRANSITION MATRIX

[OBS Transition Matrix](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-transition-matrix.751/) allows you to set a different scene transition for every combination transitions. This might not make sense right away, so let's go through a quick example.  

Let's say you have three scenes (Scene A, B and C). What if you want to set a stinger transition from A -&gt; B, but then use a fade transition from B -&gt; C. A standard OBS install requires you to manually change the scene transition in the drop down every time you want to use a different scene transition. OBS Transition Matrix allows you to manually set these so you never have to click the drop down box again.

This plugins saves you a lot of clicks so you can focus on entertaining your viewers. Super simple plugin, but a real life saver for those of you that love to use different scene transitions.

**That's it, those are all my favorite plugins. Go out and try these plugins and more importantly, experiment with these new tools and try to create something unique that you haven't seen on any other stream before. Good luck!**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ccqwhf/5_plugins_to_upgrade_your_twitch_stream/,1563033524.0,120,0.96,20,Twitch,nutella4eva

Remember if you have a goal and you reach it, especially on a platform as saturated as twitch, be proud of yourself, it’s not easy to stay motivated.

Also, people who have friends on twitch, or YouTube, or any sort of hobby/job they enjoy and share their achievements with you, NEVER mock them, it can knock  a persons confidence more than you know.

cc0m2g,Doxxing and Safety,"Over the last couple years I've gotten bored, needed something to do at work, and decided to figure out if I could locate a streamer's address.  Nothing malicious, just a fun challenge.

What I learned is that many people are very lax in making sure they hide their personal information.  I inform them that their address is public if it is, where it is, and steps to remove it.  If I find it another way I advise ways to make sure that information stays private.

The scary part is, most the time it is the streamer his/her self putting the information out there.  There are so many ways to locate someone that it can be difficult to not sound like an absolute creepy stalker letting then know about it.  Some have heeded the advice, removed the information, and been careful since, some just dont really care.

With that being said, a few tips.

Google yourself, use as much detailed info you can.  Try plugging your name and address into a search and seeing if it is listed anywhere.  Most sites offer easy ways to opt out.

Watch where you take photos, videos, and live stream.  If you live stream, wait till you're already away from the house.  I'd suggest no live streams within 5 miles of your house.  Never show addresses, street signs, etc near your house.  Businesses also are easy to find to guess where someone is in a general area.  Dont stream while driving or riding in a car to go somewhere, with enough know how and grade school math it can be used against you.

If you're a fairly large streamer, consider going to your local police dept and explain what you do.  Doxxing can lead to swatting, stalkers, etc.  They have to respond regardless, but at least if they get a bogus call they probably won't be on edge.

It'd be fun to go into the details with someone, maybe learn to sleuth better, but I'm afraid I might be giving tips to someone dangerous so dont bother asking.  Not giving any tips out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/cc0m2g/doxxing_and_safety/,1562875794.0,92,0.93,30,Twitch,Shrepto1

*Getting the world to see our gameplay requires us to capture it, pack it and send it to our platform of choice. Idealy we'd like to send a high quality stream of data, but bandwidth and processing power becomes an issue at the receivers end (i.e: Twitch, Mixer, Youtube). A ""visually lossless"" video can easily have a 30-50mbit bitrate, but not everyone has that amount of bandwidth, let alone processing ability to watch, encode and live upstream it.

**General Notes**

* x264 is still superior in image quality, though NVENC\* is lighter to use and is making progress to match x264.
   * \*Note: This only goes for RTX TURING NVENC, Older gen cards will be slower.
   * \*\*Note: I tested with a 1080Ti, a Pascal NVENC card.
* At stock profiles: going l**ower than x264 FASTER** generally yields diminishing returns (see results)
* 1080p 60 for **fast paced games** will not have enough bitrate and **will** have image quality loss.
   * **Note:** Medium to Slow paced games **can be fine,** i.e: PC Builder and Swag and Sourcery look great *according to VMAF.*
   * **Note:** 720p footage encoded **at the same bitrate** as 1080p footage **will look cleaner**, because of the amount of Bits per Pixel available to encode. [See my previous guide on Bits per Pixels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/c2tf0q/guide_not_another_generic_10_tips_to_improve_your/)
   * **Note:** Somehow upscaled 720p to 1080p at the same bitrate - **according to VMAF -** can have better *perceived* image quality? I'm trying to understand why this is the case.
* NVENC is up to 10% ""worse"" in image quality, according to VMAF. It needs more bitrate for the same quality of footage. However, if you do not have enough CPU power left, this is your best choice.
* **1600x900p** isn't an integer dividable resolution, see [EposVox on scaling](https://youtu.be/m4zZhG9pgYQ?t=1476) (and i agree with him).
   * Also see [this page for real integer scaling calculator](https://bneijt.nl/pr/resolution-scale-calculator/).
      * N.B: preferably scale by whole or half integers (1, 1.5, 0.5 etc) for ideal sharpness.

**General Conclusion:**

* Ultra Fast is generally **unusable**, very blocky, NVENC Max Performance is a better choice if available.
* x264 FASTER has the **highest overall score**, followed by Medium, Slow and Very Fast.
   * Performance impact from FASTER to MEDIUM is **up to 50% slower encoding**; quality difference is **&lt; 1-5%.**
   * MEDIUM to SLOW: **up to 35% slower encoding**; quality difference is **&lt; 1-2%.**
* If you have the computing power, MEDIUM could benefit you depending on the game type, else FASTER or FAST is the way to go on x264.
* I *assume* that TURING will be 5-10% faster/better in quality overall vs Pascal, but this can't be mathed into the results, as VMAF compares frame by frame. I would **love to test this,** but i don't have a RTX card.

Compiling the data took roughly two whole weeks. VMAF can only compare the footage so fast at 0.4x realtime speed. This means it takes almost **8½ hours for one game** just to get the VMAF data, with a total of 72 clips in 720p, 1080p, x264 profiles and NVENC profiles in all bitrates.  If you'd like to thank me for the time and research, i'm sure you'll find a way.

=========================================================================

**What is Encoding?**

&gt;Video encoding, also known as video transcoding is basically a process of converting a given video input into a digital format that is compatible with most types of Web players and mobile devices.

Encoding gives us the ability to ""shrink and optimize"" our data so it's watchable and consumable for people to watch via their PC, Phone, Tablet, Tv, etc. Transcoding is a feature that Twitch provides for you, where it takes your uploaded stream and converts it into lower bandwidth version for viewers to watch, in case they need/want to.

Withing the realm of streaming we address a few encoder options. Genrerally in order of image quality these are:

* x264 (CPU)
* NVENC (Nvidia GPU)
* QuickSync (Intel Integraded HD GPU)
* and AMD VCE (AMD GPU).

x264 has [several default profiles](http://dev.beandog.org/x264_preset_reference.html) which you can select in, for example, OBS. These profiles have preset flags on how to handle the footage for encoding. Each profile has specific tunes and tweaks. They are named, in order or fast to slow performance:

* ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo.
* NVENC has a few profiles as well. Just like x264 they have different tuning and features, such as:
   * **HIGH QUALITY**
      * B Frames, CABAC, 8x8 Transform, All Intra Modes, All Inter Modes, VBR RC, GopLength 30
   * **HIGH PERFORMANCE**
      * No B Frames, CAVLC, P16x16, Intra16x16 and Intra4x4 Modes, VBR, GopLength 30
   * **LOW LATENCY HQ**
      * No B Frames, CABAC, All Intra, All Inter Modes, Single frame VBV 2 PASS, Infinite GOP
   * **LOW LATENCY HP**
      * No B Frames, CABAC, All Intra and Inter Modes, Single frame VBV 2 PASS, Infinite GOP, Smaller Search Range compared to LOW LATENCY HQ

Every PC will be able to do x264 encoding, however this can be very taxing depending on the selected settings and computing power available from you CPU(s). If you have the capable hardware, NVENC, QuickSync and AMD VCE are Hardware Encoders are optional choices and are rated in order of ease/quality. However, for testing i did not include QuickSync nor AMD.

=========================================================================

**Hardware v Software encoding**

x264 CPU software encoding is accessible for most users. It only relies on raw computing power of your CPU. Hardware encoding relies on specific hardware, the most addressed being NVENC, followed by QuickSync and AMD VCE. The latter giving (very) low quality/performance returns and sadly not optimised for (live) streaming in the current state that it is.

The general consensus is that **x264 is still superior in image quality** versus hardware encoders, though at the expense of (a little bit) more resources. The new Nvidia Turing NVENC (RTX cards) have ***improved*** image quality, where it comes close to x264 FAST or FASTER, however in high paced scenes and especially static scenes x264 will still take the crown in regards to image quality.

&gt;In the faster moving Forza Horizon 4 benchmark, Turing’s NVENC does outperform x264 veryfast in some areas, NVENC again probably has slightly worse blocking but veryfast really struggles with moving fine detail. With this level of motion, NVENC is approximately equal to x264’s “faster” preset. There is no doubt, however, that x264’s “fast” preset is significantly better than NVENC in fast motion, and completely smokes it when there is slow or no motion.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.techspot.com/article/1740-game-streaming-best-quality-settings/](https://www.techspot.com/article/1740-game-streaming-best-quality-settings/)

Older generation cards like Pascal, will be comparible to x264 FASTER in best case scenario's and when there's enough bitrate available to encode.

=========================================================================

**How do we compare image quality?**

We can compare the image quality by doing a visual comparison, where we trust out eyes and say what *we personally feel* looks better, and we can compare with statistical data. Using both we can get best of both worlds. If we trust our eyes what ***feels and looks best*** and lay that next to what **statistically** looks better, we can pick the best combination. We can do that by comparing with [SSIM, Structural Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) and [VMAF, Video\_Multimethod\_Assessment\_Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Multimethod_Assessment_Fusion).

**SSIM:**

&gt;""SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric; in other words, the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.""

SSIM is scored on a 0 to 1 basis, [with values below 0.5 being bad (very annoying) and 0.95 and up to be good with ""perceptible but not annoying"" quality impairment](https://streaminglearningcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MappSSIM.png).

**VMAF:**

&gt;""Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) is an objective full-reference video quality metric developed by Netflix \[...\] It predicts subjective video quality based on a reference and distorted video sequence. The metric can be used to evaluate the quality of different video codecs, encoders, encoding settings, or transmission variants.""

..

&gt;""In his article entitled [VMAF Reproducibility: Validating a Perceptual Practical Video Quality Metric](https://www.realnetworks.com/sites/default/files/vmaf_reproducibility_ieee.pdf), RealNetworks CTO Reza Rassool concluded “if a video service operator were to encode video to achieve a VMAF score of about 93 then they would be confident of optimally serving the vast majority of their audience with content that is either indistinguishable from original or with noticeable but not annoying distortion.""

The benefit of VMAF is that it has a 'trained algorithm'. The results of that are based on human perception and feedback on 1080p streaming content. This is then layed out on a scale between 0 and 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being excellent viewing quality. A score of \~93 would be ""optimal"" for streaming in regards to quality v bandwidth. The package used at the time of comparison is vmaf\_v0.6.1.

SSIM (and MS-SSIM) has been around for over a decade and recognised for it's work in the field of image/quality comparison. VMAF is relatively new on the scene, being developed by Netflix for analysis of streamable content. For the comparison i have mapped out all footage to both of these values, but will stick to VMAF as a more ""true to face value"" comparible result.

My *personal* VMAF scale would be:

|VMAF Score|Perception|
|:-|:-|
|= &gt; 96|Indistinguishable from source|
|85-95|Good quality, the closer to 93 the better for streaming|
|76-85|Decent quality, slight blocking, not really disturbing|
|66-75|Barely decent quality, blocking is very evident, ***barely watchable***|
|&lt; 66|Forget about it|

&amp;#x200B;

**Apex (Fast gameplay):**

* **x264 wins handsdown.**
* For some reason, 720p upscaled back to 1080p scores **lower, unsure if this is a glitch**.
   * \*for the sake of comparison, double the points for 720p for now; i am retesting this but want to get a preliminary version out first.

**PC Builder, Swag And Sourcery (Slow/Static gameplay):**

* Throughout the whole test range, up to 3000kbps, **scores for 1080p and 720p are roughly equal** between x264 and NVENC. Below 3000kbit NVENC starts to lose quality vs x264.
* Even SSIM is 0.99 on average for both encoders at both resolutions. However, one could suggest that blocking below 4000kbps would become a matter of **personal taste or bandwidth issue, to consider if that's fine or not**.
* When comparing both 6000kbps footage for detail loss, look at 01m:18s when the case rotates.
   * x264 FASTER preserves details nice and more clean, even with a lower total bitrate (5039kbps)
   * NVENC 6000kbit already ""loses"" these at 6000.
      * **PC Builder Simulator:** Look at the PCI brackets and bottom of the motherboard tray / PSU cover.  [See comparison image](https://snag.gy/Gi4CWc.jpg)
      * **Swag and Sourcery:** Quality in overal is 95% the same, only rapid scene changes (menu, fading, back to main screen, etc) show a big difference. Look at fine details. [See comparison image](https://snag.gy/1hfoie.jpg)

Why are the ads so ridiculously loud?!

They're easily 6x louder than the stream, and if you're watching a small streamer who might not have the best mic, you need to have the volume turned somewhat up to hear them. Suddenly an ad interrupts without warning...

**BOOOOM**... it's **DANGEROUSLY LOUD!** Like the decibel level is absolutely harmful to your ears!

I'm not even joking. Every time an ad comes up, I'm instantly reaching for the volume, and it's also to the point where I no longer let Twitch play in the background  anymore.

This is what I get for my Twitch Prime sub? My ears blasted at obscenely high decibel levels?

c4hwrq,The Gaming Drought,"Is it me or does it feel like there’s nothing good to play? I was streaming today and for the first time I wasn’t enjoying myself. I switched through several games from Smash Bros Ultimate, to Sea Of Thieves, and even to Plants be Zombies. I’ve played games like Black Ops 4 and even Fortnite, but no matter what I play I can’t seem to enjoy the game. 

What can I do? I love streaming. It’s something I’m deeply passionate about, yet here I am feeling like there’s a lack of quality titles for me to enjoy. While my viewers enjoy my content and I want to continue to grow I feel like I am unable to deliver quality entertainment if there’s nothing I enjoy playing.

c462q0,Free Virtual Green Screen," 

Did you know that’s possible? And it’s super easy. Here’s how you can achieve the effect of a virtual green screen, for free.

1. Download and install [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/).
2. When  setting Snap Camera up, it’ll ask for your actual webcam. Use your  actual webcam as the source for this app. Ensure your camera is facing  you as directly as possible or it’s going to think facial features are  background.
3. Grab my [Green Screen snap filter](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=6c8a9bc85a6a4d10a3e919ed7fef0bce&amp;metadata=01). It replaces what it sees as the whole background with a flat green surface.
4. In OBS (or your chosen broadcasting software) replace your webcam feed with a new one you’ll see in the list called Snap Camera.
5. Set  a new Chroma Key filter on your Snap Camera (right click the source  &gt; filters &gt; the plus sign in the bottom right corner of the  filters window &gt; Chroma Key)
6. I  set the similarity to 300, smoothness to 200, and key color spill  reduction to 200. I was able to pull this off using just light from my  monitors.
7. Clean up your background as much as possible so the Snap Camera app can see you the best.
8. Done!

Do  note: This requires a TON of CPU power and lags your camera input to  OBS quite a bit. You will have to have a super powered CPU (I recommend  testing this for yourself) and offset your mic input to match your  webcam lag.

c2abst,Unpopular Opinion: Amazon is holding Twitch back from its true potential.,"Title.

More refined examples: A lot of streaming platforms in Asia will just shove a streamer right in front of the viewer's eyes as a form of the streamer getting rapidly discovered. On Twitch, if you're just starting out and you don't have an audience from another platform (instagram, YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter), then you won't have viewers on your first twitch stream. Twitch has nothing to remedy this in 2019? **really?**

If [Emmett Shear doesn't want it to happen, it just doesn't happen](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Twitch-RVW17215978.htm), according to this glass door review.

He said basically that Twitch has already paid back that 1 billion USD that Amazon used to buy Twitch in the form of Twitch Prime subs.

I had the pleasure of managing our charity events that we ran raising money for St. Jude. Over the past 2 years in the events we have ran, we have raised over $38,000!!! When I started, I did not imagine coming close to this number.

This would not have been possible without the amazing sponsors who donated prizes. [Charity Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/bjitn4/were_supporting_st_jude_live_2019_forthekids/)

Our community has come together to help others every day with big and small issues relating to streaming, personal issues, or most importantly, raising money for those who need it most. I do hope that our community keeps this up. It is what makes you special.

I want to say an additional thank you to the other /r/Twitch mods. Without you, there would be no /r/Twitch. You all give up so much of your own time and energy for no pay, but to show for it, is this awesome community that we all have built. Without you, I would not be where I am today. Thank you.

Seriously Hosting/Raiding is meant to be a happy way to link and share viewers/communities but getting served with 3 30secs ads means you missed the whole point of the raid by the time 90secs ads are finished. The same goes for just dropping in to see what X streamer is upto just to get the minimum of 30secs sometimes more just to find out they are going offline grrr.

I dont mind ads i really dont but they have to be served properly! Showing me the same ad for cyberpunk 2077 23 times today doesn't make me want to buy it more infact it's starting to do the reverse and I'm getting sick of seeing it :/

bzocsm,Twitch gave me joy,"Just wanted to share this story, because I've been lurking on this subreddit reading other people's awesome stories about streaming. 

I've been streaming for about a couple months (semi-regularly) now and tonight was a milestone kind of night for me. 

I started seeing a therapist months ago because I was diagnosed with depression (due to the past and current circumstances of my life). I started streaming regularly due to two things: my therapist telling me that I should focus balance my life with things that I enjoy and because a streamer (friend) suggested it. Video games was my first love and that made it seem like a good idea. 

So I started streaming, but due to my anxiety I always freeze up and didn't want to talk out of fear of being judged by anyone watching. Or feeling like no one wanted to listen. I got put on medication and it helped with me not being so doom and gloom, and only focusing on the negatives. 

I started streaming purely for the fun of it. Played games with friends for fun and that's it. I started just enjoying my time and not stressing out on everything that I say. I eat swhile I game because I like to do food challenges. I sing while I game because I like to sing. I curse when I game because I get frustrated when losing. I started being myself. And that's what it's all about.

Today was my last day in therapy. Tonight was also the first time I got 20 viewers and made it to the top viewer for WWZ somehow. It truly was a joyous night for me.

TL;DR Recovering from depression, Twitch streaming helped, and now 2 away from Affiliate! (^_^)b

byz2ha,[Guide] Animate Your Stream With Motion Effects!,"[FULL VIDEO GUIDE!](https://youtu.be/LJw_dw46DxA)

Last week I made a beginner's guide for creating animated stinger transitions. If you didn't see it, here is the [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/bwkel5/guide_create_your_own_animated_stinger/). This week's guide is a little different and in my opinion way cooler.  

**INTRODUCTION**

If you've ever tried to make your own overlays and layouts for your streams, you might know that while OBS has a tonne of options for making great layouts, it doesn't have a lot of built in options for animating your stream. Sources like your camera or your game capture don't move when you change scenes, they're always static. This guide will show you can make OBS animate your sources so that when you change scenes or hit a hotkey, it can grow or move to another position on your canvas with a smooth animation. This is all done thanks to a (relatively) new OBS filter called *Motion Effect*. (See the video guide for examples).  

**WHAT YOU'LL NEED**  

* OBS Studio (of course) ► [Download](https://obsproject.com/download)  
* Motion Effect ► [Download](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/motion-effect.668/)  

**INSTALLATION**  

1. Download the plugin [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/motion-effect.668/)  
2. Go to where your OBS Studio install is located (usually in C:/Program Files/OBS Studio or similar)  
3. Unzip the downloaded file directly into the root of your OBS Studio install  

**HOW IT WORKS**  

There are two methods to animated your sources in OBS and both can be used together.  

1. Via scene transitions  
2. Via an effect filter

*Method 1: Via Scenes Transitions*  

With this method, every source will be animated each time you switch scenes.  

1. In the Scene Transitions section window (If you don't see it, check View &gt; Docks &gt; Scene Transition), click the + sign and select *Motion* [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8Gce0BG.png)
2. That's it, really

The plugin will work immediately. Once you switch scenes, you'll start to see your sources move. The sources will be animated as follows. Let's say you you are transitioning from Scenes A -&gt; Scene B.

* If a source exists on Scene A AND Scene B, the source will be transformed (i.e. the source will move from where it is on Scene A to where it is on Scene B  
* If a source exists on Scene A but NOT Scene B, the source will zoom out and disappear  
* If a source does NOT exist on Scene A but it does on Scene B, the source will appear and zoom in  

If you want your scenes to animate correctly, you also need to make sure:  

* The *Bounding Box Type* of each source is set to *No Bounds*  
* The *Positional Alignment* of each source is the same on Scene A and B  
* There is only one instance of each source on Scene A and B  
* The order of the sources is the same on Scene A and B (otherwise you'll get some weird clipping)  

*Method 2: Via Effect Filters*  

This method works by adding a *Motion* effect filter to a *scene* (NOT a source, this won't work) and then specifying which source to animate. This method is used if you want more granular control over how each individual source moves, whereas in the first method, all the sources move with a predetermined behavior.  

1. Right click on a *scene* and go to *Filters*  
2. Click the + sign and add a *Motion* filter  
3. Select the source you want to animate (e.g. your webcam)  
4. Select how you want the animation to be triggered (either via a hot key or each time the selected scene becomes active)  
5. Select the variation type e.g. if you want your source to grow, select *size* and if you want it to move, select *position* (or *size and position* if you want to do both)  
6. Set your starting size/position and your ending size/position  
7. Set the duration of the animation and acceleration (negative if you want the animation to start fast and slow down, positive if you want it to speed up)  
8. Click OK and you're done (if you selected one of the hotkey trigger behaviors, go to Settings &gt; Hotkeys and search for the *Forward* and *Back* filters to set the hotkey you want to use to trigger the animation)  

That's pretty much it, just repeat this for every source you want to animate.

byjru6,My newly bought PC isn't capable to stream to the extent I expected it to be - looking for advice on how to improve performance,"Hello Reddit,

about 2 months ago I finally replaced my previous PC that was almost dying and I got some advice on the configuration since I wanted to stream with the PC as well. Previously I was running a Xeon E3-1230 v3 @3.30 GHz and a GTX 770 with 2 GB VRAM. My CPU was pretty bad at that time so I encoded using NVENC at 1080p@60fps in virtually all games. World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny 2 had their minor artifacts but it was smooth and really surprisingly good. Even more CPU-intense games such as The Division 1 were causing to much load on the computer and I dropped to 1080p@30fps for it in particular. Going forward I expected to build a PC that would be able to achieve at least the same with regards to ouput and quality. Thus I got the following parts:

*  AMD - Ryzen 7 2700X 3.7 GHz 
*  MSI - B450 GAMING PRO CARBON 
*  G.Skill - Aegis 32 GB DDR4-3000 
*  Sapphire - Radeon RX VEGA 56 8 GB PULSE 
*  SeaSonic - FOCUS Plus Gold 550 W 

""Unfortunately"" I upgraded my 1080p BenQ XL2720Z 27-Inch monitor to a 1440p Dell S2719DGF 27-Inch. I haven't considered a different build and completely forgot that a different monitor will have its downsides as well and requires a different setup.

I spent two days figuring out proper settings and was really disappointed that the AMD Encoder in Streamlabs seems to be inferior in all aspects compared to my previous NVENC results which was frustrating to say the least. After reading more suggestions in forums and Reddit I tried x264 since my CPU should be able to handle that without much trouble, at least that's the impression nearly everyone was implying. Turns out this isn't true and all CPU-intense games are causing serious encoding issues that make streaming with high settings nearly impossible.

The actual symptoms are that my games are \*NEVER\* dropping frames or stuttering or impacted in any other way. \*NEVER\*! However, the stream is having dropped frames depending on how much CPU is used by the game I am playing. A good example is when moving in Destiny 2 to a social hub and suddenly 20 people spawn my stream is pretty much dead. Same in 24man raids in FF, that are literally unstreamable.

At first I tweaked my settings on a game-to-game basis and started with a 1080p canvas being rescaled (in the Video settings not the Output tab) to 720p at 60fps. The quality was the same as on my previous PC on a 1080p@60fps setting which was baffling to me. The veryfast preset sometimes bottlenecked nonetheless and I had to go down to superfast which was the exact opposite of what others have been writing since they mentioned they were able to run fast or even medium. I can just assume they are doing so in games that aren't as CPU-intensive as the MMOs I play.

Right now, especially after experimenting in Destiny 2 for the past two days, I ended up with the following:

Windowed mode at 1080p on a 1080p canvas ingame with VSync set to 72 Hz (only fractions of 144 Hz are available) and a framerate cap of 60fps rescaled to 720p@60fps at fast preset with a bitrate of 6000 and the following options \`subme=9 no-fast-pskip=1 b-adapt=2 bframes=1 8x8dct=1 partitions=all me=umh merange=20\` works with occasional hickups.

I really dislike playing in windowed mode and that's where my problems with the new monitor are coming into play. When I play the game at 1440p and use a 1440p canvas with all other options being the same, my stream is dying. Playing in 1440p fullscreen with a 1080p resolution ingame (either by selecting it or setting down the resolution scale) will behave as previously but look ugly on my end on the 1440p resolution.

The 1440p resolution had only a decent performance when I tune the settings down to 720p@48fps and reduce the VSync and framerate cap ingame to 48fps as well. A configuration of streaming at 900p@30fps worked out okay-ish but the difference between 30fps and 60fps and definitely noticeable.

World of Warcraft is currently, especially in the new zones, completely unstreamable and I completely gave up on that game. Final Fantasy is having serious issue with Freesync and really difficult to tune as well.

So in essence, I am really disappointed that I cannot stream with the same settings and quality as previously and that my 6 year old rig was handling it MUCH better than the new one. I am seeking some advice what some viable options would be going forward.

1. Is there anything on a software-level I might attempt to adjust?
2. Are there any reasonable hardware tweaks or upgrades you might suggest looking into?
3. Is it really necessary to think about a dedicated second PC only for encoding/streaming? (Which would be really disheartening after spending so much money already...)

(I'd really like to play on a native 1440p@60fps resolution and stream in at least 900p@60fps.)

by867w,Just because I can take abuse doesn't mean my viewers have to see it.,"We've all been told, ""sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me."" Which I highly encourage everyone to subscribe to.

&amp;#x200B;

When you're streaming though, you don't have to be a human pinata for whoever comes by. You need to show you can roll with people who may come off as insensitive but you also need to make sure your viewers are never uncomfortable with what is being tossed your way. They are invested in you, they like seeing you with a witty comeback or quick quip but they don't want to see you just taking punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to ban my first person this week. I'm open with my mental illness and autism and Aspergers and I have found that some people like to find streamers who are different, go into their chat and insult them more and more until they catch on. I had one of these people come in this week. They were politely shown the door.

&amp;#x200B;

If this makes sense, you need to think of the breaking point of your viewers instead of your own personal breaking point. I've been different all my life so I'm used to being called names, no big deal. My viewers may not be used to seeing it, or they may have to deal with it in their own personal lives and they don't want to see it when they're looking to be entertained. My concern (and I believe yours should be as well) is of the viewers when it comes to comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not to say that your personal comfort isn't important. If those things bother you then yes, do what's best for you even if it doesn't bother your viewers. I will say though, try to put some thought into Twitch being very hard for you to know the viewer's intentions with only chat for communication. Some people may be sarcastic, others may be very dry with their delivery, some may not know manners in social situations. Being too hasty could end up removing good people in your channel who came off on the worst possible foot on day one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/by867w/just_because_i_can_take_abuse_doesnt_mean_my/,1560001891.0,543,0.93,96,Twitch,PanicGamer_and_Simon

&amp;#x200B;

Every viewer is a person who has a life of their own and is taking time out of their day to be entertained by a streamer's channel. When you think of them as a number that you grind out or a goal to get a certain amount you dehumanize them and devalue them.

&amp;#x200B;

Viewers are everything. They're the ones that... 

&amp;#x200B;

* Show up before your stream starts and watches your staring soon screen until you begin
* Pop in when they're busy but want to say hi
* Watch your VODs when they miss your stream
* Move your chat along
* Help you with games when you're stuck
* Welcome new viewers into your chat
* Send you messages on Twitch or in your Discord thanking you for great streams
* Share your streams on social media to their friends and family
* Stays on your channel when you have technical difficulties during a stream
* Offer to become Mod or help you in other ways with your channel
* Take a genuine interest in your life and your wellbeing 
* Literally, become your community

bwdpwp,Make your own Elgato Stream Deck,"Lately I've been searching for programmable keyboards to use when streaming on Twitch. Of course, the Elgato Stream Deck is hands down the best option, but a bit pricey. So I came up with an affordable alternative.

# Here's what you need:

* a MIDI device/keyboard
* some free software

# Instructions

In order to accomplish this, we're going to use  a program called [BOME Midi Translator Classic](https://www.bome.com/products/mtclassic), which allows us to **translate a MIDI keypress into a regular keypress** (or a combination of them).

Detailed instructions along with screenshots of the process can be found [here](https://medium.com/@InternetJohnny/make-your-own-elgato-stream-deck-2f211224b498).

This let's us map the press of a pad to, for instance, the volume up key-combo (it's `fn` \+ `F4` on my keyboard)

We will also use a program called [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

**AHK let’s you remap** ***any key combo*** **to something else.** Here's an example of a really useful script I have:

    #j::
        Send, myemail@gmail.com
    Return

**Translated:**

Line 1 - It creates a new shortcut for `Win` \+ `j`

Line 2 - When the shortcut is activated, it sends the text after the `Send,`  statement

Line 3 - ends the script

It is hard to state how much time this has saved me in the long run. You can do this and much more with it.

Let me know if you have any questions :)

**EDIT**: I'd also love to know if there are cheaper alternatives to the Stream Deck that offer the same functionality (since I didn't find anything). If you know any, please tell me.

**EDIT2**: I broke a rule when I posted only the link to the Medium post, but the mods were nice 🙏and explained what I did wrong.

bvkbqh,Full Overlay / Minimalist / Not at all?,"Hello!

I get that this question pops up every now and again but things change and people have more experiences, so I wanted to ask:

From a streamer perspective (not necessarily your personal viewing preference) which of these - if any - have you found more traction with on your channel?

- Full Overlay
- Minimal (eg border)
- None

I'm finding myself in a bit of a jam. The majority of my current viewers tell me they prefer no overlay but I'm positive more viewers are finding me / choosing my stream as a result of at least a minimal one.

Everything I've understood about marketing is bright things get people's attention and I haven't lost any followers as a result, but I value their opinion and would love to hear yours!

bujscy,PSA for single-PC streamers: it IS possible to separate browser source alerts from your other audio,"Decided to create this post because it's something I struggled with quite a bit and everything I can find on this sub suggests that it's either impossible or requires a paid software extension to make it work.

Currently, I'm using OBS.Live with StreamElements overlays as a browser source for my alerts. As most are aware, OBS automatically plays browser-sourced audio through the default audio device (in most cases, your headset/speakers). This can be very inconvenient sometimes, especially if you are playing a game that requires a lot of focus or relies heavily on hearing sounds around you in the game.

However, since the introduction of Windows 10 version 1803 (April 2018 update), the sound panel has been upgraded to allow per-app sound input/output control. I won't bother lengthening this post with those instructions so [here is a detailed tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/352787/how-to-set-per-app-sound-outputs-in-windows-10/) on how to access this feature.

#Audio Setup:

In order to accomplish this, you still need an additional audio mixer such as Voicemeeter (VM) Banana/Potato. The primary VM input (""Voicemeeter Input"") should be assigned as your default playback device in Windows and your headset should be assigned as a hardware output (let's say A1). 

Then, follow the instructions linked above to find the OBS output and change it to one of the VM Aux inputs (""Voicemeeter Aux Input""). Now, you need to choose an output - let's use B1 (""Voicemeeter Output""). In OBS, set the Desktop Audio Source as ""Voicemeeter Input"" and one of the Mic/Aux devices as ""Voicemeeter Output"". 

Finally, you just need to configure the channel assignments. In VM, assign Voicemeeter VAIO to A1 only and assign Voicemeeter Aux to B1 only.

You're done! Your desktop audio will now flow through VM, to your headset (A1) and alert audio will feed directly back to OBS (B1) without ever reaching your ears. Additionally, you can assign Aux to A1 and just lower the volume if you still want your alerts but quieter, then adjust B1 higher so the volume is the same on stream.

The only downside to this is that any music sources flowing directly through OBS will also take the same path as your alert audio. However, you can use the same method above to split any other program outputs as well and control those volumes separately (VM Potato has lots of extra inputs/outputs to make this work).

btvb40,Viewers wanting personal information,"Hi. I casually stream and I don't use a webcam (mic only), use my real name or give out any personal info like what town I live in, where I work, what I do or much family info. I like to play games and chit chat with viewers mostly about games or films or general stuff. However I'm a private person to an extent and while I enjoy playing games I don't really want to give my personal info out or build myself into a brand   


However I'm finding I have certain viewers asking me about more personal things. People asking me what area I live in, what I do for work, what hours I work, my living situation (who I live with, do I own/rent), how old I am and now had a couple comment on how I don't post photos of myself, use a cam or give out a bunch of my personal info about my day to day life. To me streaming is a bit of an escape from my day at work and personal life but people coming in and asking me for personal info or wanting to become a part of personal life is a bit weird. Generally when I talk to  other streamers I don't ask them about home/work/family unless it's something they're actively discussing it and seem comfortable about it.  


I know some might say ""don't stream unless you want to be a public figure"" but I would like to be able to stream games and have casual chats with people in a way that I'm comfortable and not having to give up all my personal details.

btl0sc,"I spent 7 hours appreciating my viewers, and I recommend it.","I've been streaming on twitch consistently for a year and 10 days now. For hitting 500 followers, I planned to have this ""Appreciation Stream."" This kept getting put off until it came to my 1 year on Twitch, so I did the Appreciation Stream alongside the 1 year celebration. Essentially I wanted to go through my 500 followers, and for those that just followed and I never saw them say anything in chat or they said very little and I hardly see them around, I went through and said all their names and just thanked them for giving me the time of day at some point, or just being lurkers if that's what they were into.  


For my regulars, VIPs, Mods, and a separate team I started a podcast with, I got a lot more wholesome and picked out specific memories with them and even some of them talked about how they've impacted my life in a positive direction. For each individual I talked about, I took down a time stamp of when I brought them up and I sent them the VOD on discord with that time stamp, just in case they were busy and couldn't make it so it's more convenient for them to find. As far as a visual for all of this, I just had my camera, background, and the chat. I also asked chat to participate in appreciating whoever it was that I mentioned, and a lot of people had a lot of nice things to say there too, so it was great for that to reflect on screen for them to view in the VOD.  


I **HIGHLY** recommend this if you have an occasion coming up that's twitch-related, or maybe for a follower goal. Like I said, it's been a year and 10 days, and in this extra 10 days, I've noticed such a stronger connection and more communication between my viewers and I. Plus, the feedback I got from the messages I sent out was incredible. Just amazing and wholesome back and forths between friends, fellow streamers I look up to, and huge supporters.   


Sometimes seems like there's a shortage of positivity on Twitch. Some streamers might strive for a positive feel to their stream, but with frustrating competitive games and taunting chats, I get it. Not every day can be perfect. But I really hope you might take this idea into consideration and spark something within your community.

bspnff,Looking for advice from medium-sized streamers with experience negotiating brand deals.,"This is a bit of a long shot but I figured it's worth a try. 

I'm pretty lost when it comes to brand negotiations. I've been streaming for a long time but I've been growing more over the past few months and I get approached by brands a lot more often. The issue is they will usually ask me what my rate is depending on what the partnership requires of me but I have no idea what to tell them. I have no clue what other streamers typically ask for and I don't really want to offer too much nor too little.

bpjlw4,Am I the only one that thinks when a person gets banned from a channel they shouldnt be able to view the streamer either.,"
I am a moderator for a twitch streamer who has constantly been getting stream sniped while playing Realm Royale. 

At first the guy came in nice and we all welcomed him,but after a certain amount of time he started to stream snipe and kill her off of spawn. 

We found out that this guy is a big sniper around the realm community and has been banned in multiple streamers chats for the exact same resson.

Today he was officially banned from the chat,but now he is still stream sniping her and the games are becoming less fun for her.

She even hides her screen so he wont see where she lands but he finds her and kills her anyway. At this point I feel like when a person is banned its for a major reason and that they shouldnt get the satisfaction of seeing the streamer anymore. 

I know being banned may turn some people away from the chat but if theyre a stream sniper they will just continue to do it at the enjoyment of pissing off the streamer.

I just wanted to know how everyone else felt on this situation either from other streamers or just viewers who have seen people like this in chat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/bpjlw4/am_i_the_only_one_that_thinks_when_a_person_gets/,1558048439.0,695,0.87,158,Twitch,ChaoticTemptress

boanub,Embarrassing clip of me in YT video,"Some guy who collects clips from many twitch channels, both big and small, has included a clip of me in one of his compilations, twice. One of them I dont really mind, but the other one.. that one I'd like gone or forgotten.  
  
Im pretty sure I have just about 3 options, but I'm not sure which one would be best, or if any of them could make stuff worse (e.g. be remembered as the jerk who got the clip removed. I doubt it would happen, but it could happen).  
  
I said the clip is embarrassing for me, so I'd rather not share it. But imagine it as one of those moments where you shred a massive fart mid-class.  
I managed to come up with 3 options to handle that ""fart"", listed in the order I think they would work out best. However I would like some help.  
  
1. Embrace it, take pride in it and laugh it off. What I think is embarrassing, others may look back on laughing of it and thinking it was a good time.  
  
  
2. Try and hide it, ask everyone to forget about it.
Non-figuratively, contact the guy who uploaded it and ask nicely for it to be removed, and afterwards hide/delete the clip from my twitch channel.  
  
  
3. Ask the teacher to make everyone forget it.
Basically same as 2. except instead of contacting the uploader, I report the video for copyright infringement.  
  
  
  
I'm a small streamer.  
I do stuff that is stupid from time to time, but this is the only thing I regret. Not stupid as in breaking ToS, but just plain stupid or messed up.

Thanks for any help in advance.

Edit: Formatting. This is pretty much my first post ever.  
  
  
Edit: I'm probably gonna try and embrace it and move on. I've come to the conclusion that it is probably not as big of a deal as I think it is.

Earlier tonight I went on twitchswitch to find a complete random streamer to raid, I raided someone around 5-8 viewers streaming Fortnite and the first thing they said to my 40+ viewer raid was “oh my god my chat is going to be full of R** again”. I was very confused and the whole time he was being very negative to all my viewers; and called them annoying when they asked questions such as “How long have you been playing?”. After a while he turned off his webcam and just played the game not reading chat and not talking much except for the occasional death and or kill. Everyone in my community was being very respectable towards him and it had me completely baffled. I immediately unhosted him and apologized to everyone.

bnn1j9,What I learned from streaming alone often (0 viewer),"  

I am a small streamer averaging 1-2 viewers... But the truth is, I really don’t mind. For me, it’s just me playing my own game and enjoy my own time. Sometimes some kind soul stopping by then be on their own way. Sometimes it’s just me playing with my camera on.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been seeing a lot of threads talking about how to increase numbers, how to get more views. I honestly think it’s misleading and harmful for the community. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best moment for me is not donation(barely any, someone gave me a 1 about a week ago) or how many subscribers. It's actually a small talk, usually things that are trivial.  It literally excites me every time when the chat starts flowing and I love the fact someone is spending the time which they will NEVER get back watching a total stranger playing a game. That's my mindset at least

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know how many of you out there feel the same. If there are ways or platform that allow me to turn passion into a future without losing in touch with my viewers great. If not, I am totally ok as where I am now. But I wouldn’t sacrifice the genuine connection for anything else.

bnj6hd,Attempted My First 24 Hour Stream Yesterday,"Writing this not really as a guide. It was just my story and experience on this wild ride that I think might be interesting and entertaining to read if you're also an aspiring streamer like myself. Anyways...

I failed.

Made it to 16 hours and my brain and body were crumbling. I'm not that upset about it as my viewers seemed to understand and honestly, those that were really interested in the 24 hour stream had already been there for 12+ hours at that point regardless.

Anyways, HERE'S MY TALE: I started streaming semi-seriously about a month and a half ago. I gotta say it's going way better than I ever imagined it would. I can usually average 7-12 viewers on whatever I'm playing, and if I'm playing my main game I can occasionally get bigger numbers like 19 when the stars align. I started the whole 24 hour stream fiasco as being NOT  a 24 hour stream. I hadn't broken my max viewer count in several weeks and my greatest fear is stagnation, so I decided to put on a big event of this stream.

I gave it a huge long name that was mostly a joke (it was no less than 12 words long) which my homies liked, I  advertised it on discord, all the usual. I made sure to set up ""stretch goals"" to keep things interested and maybe build some more hype around it.

Those stretch goals were set up for 200, 215, 230, and 250 followers reached (I started the stream at 184 followers). I also had goals for hitting 15, 20, 25, and 35 concurrent viewers. Some examples: The 200 follower goal was I would do 200 push-ups on stream, spoilers, I couldn't, but the 50 that I managed seemed to get the people pogging. The 20 viewers one was that I would dance hardcore to the wii shop music for 10 minutes which was... an experience. So the stream started off pretty normal. Went maybe 2 hours and hit my usual stride of give or take 7 viewers. Nothing crazy was going on and honestly I was a little bummed that I hadn't sen much success, having not even met 1 stretch goal. I was feeling pretty defeated, but decided I'd give it one more big push just to see what would happen (Word of advice with streaming from what I've seen: always, ALWAYS do that ""one more time"" thing. I've built most my community on moments like the one I'm about to describe). Well, I did that push. My usual shtick is that I'll go into my main game, VRChat, and ""stream perform"" via guitar or piano and my voice. I'll gather a small crowd and then plug my ish at the end of a song, then play another. It's very chill. Sometimes not a soul listens, sometimes I'll gather an in-game crowd of 12 + the stream viewers. On this particular ""last push"", I gathered ~people. Well, every single one of them followed, which led to hitting the 200 follower stretch goal. That caused the viewer count to jump to 15, hitting the 2nd stretch goal.  Then someone gifted 5 subs which hyped the chat more, causing us to hit another stretch goal. So basically I hit 3 of my craziest stretch goals in the period of 60 seconds after 3+ hours of more or less a ""failed"" stream.

So that went on, I did all the stretch goals, got very hot and sweaty Kappa, and we strove on. It was around this point (We were sitting on a consistent 10 now) that I decided frick it, we're gonna go for the big 24 hour. Note, this was the big stretch goal that we DID NOT hit, but I was feeling so it we decided to try it.

There were a lot, a whole lot, of super fun and hype moments in the stream. The other big one that comes to mind is when I got raided by 2 streamers (unrelated) within a 5 second period (I'm not exxagerating) each with 10 viewers. That shot us up to 28 viewers (my all-time high btw. So we break our viewership record 3 times in 1 stream omega). I could honestly just keep going on and on about how awesome it was, and how much the community developed and all. There were seriously a few guys that stayed in the stream for over 12 hours. Which is insane and honestly kind of stupid since I'm really not that entertaining but have a good voice.

I won't write any more about it since I've already written this book, but some closing remarks: 
1. If you're going to also do a 24 hour stream, I'd say don't lie to yourself about your community. Do you genuinely have people that are going to watch for more than an hour? 
2. There's going to be very ""low energy"" moments that will kick your butt, but if you stick with it there's a chance you could get double-raided and triple your viewer count. Probably not, but that leads into point 3
3. Keep going. At least for me, streaming has been entirely about ""moments"". You've gotta put in the work with consistency and knowing yourself and what makes you marketable, but it's the big MOMENTS that change everything. The moments where someone donates you $300 for no reason, or you get double raided, or you hit 3 stretch goals at once. These are just examples for myself, but you could have your own.

Anyways. I was just feeling very good about how the stream went and wanted to share some of my excitement and what is hopefully a constructive way. Hope this was at LEAST an interesting read. I'd take my advice with a grain of a salt as I'm still just a small boy (215 followers as of last night!)

bn07ak,Don't let someone think you are responsible for their emotion state or happiness!,"I'm sure I'm not the only streamer who has had to deal with this situation.

Early on I got a very invested viewer let's call him Joe. 

Joe was sweet he would tune in when he could, which was hard cause of the time zone difference but he made an effort to keep up with the streams as best he could. Eventually he and I started to play rocket league. He's much better and I looked up to him in a way and he made me a better player for sure.

However the more we spoke Joe seemed to reveal more about his life and struggles he had. Eventually he started to send me very dark things to which as soon as they started I told him to see a therapist. To which according to him he did. He was good about the boundary I set because I didn't want to say the wrong thing and set him off.

However, Joe decided one day that boundary didn't exist. And as of recently it became very distressing to read the messages he would send me and I felt obligated to help him.

About 2 days ago I ended up waking up to a message on discord from him threatening suicide and saying he was going to end it. Believe me that's the short of it because the actual message he sent me was a paragraph. Just as I was about to reply *poof* message was deleted and replaced with ""Hey Samma, how's it going?"". So I called him on it. 

I told him if this keeps up we can't be friends anymore and through this time I had learned that he was sending these same messages to other streamers all girls. He seemed to only target female streamers. 

In the end I had to block him but before that he threatened suicide. Wasn't online for almost 2 days then sent me 3 messages exact quotes.

""I tried to commit suicide last night""
""The police stopped me""
""You judged me and pushed me to far""

I have now blocked him I feel great pain from it but at the same time I can't help him. And at this point I feel like it was all just for attention.

Sorry for the long winded post just really had to get it off my chest. I cared a lot for this friend but he pushed me to far and did not respect my boundaries even though I respected all of his.

Some of you had PMed me asking what my channel is it's the same as my username on here. :)

&amp;#x200B;

When I read posts about new streamers trying to balance other parts of life with streaming,  wondering how you manage it all.

&amp;#x200B;

I say don't try.

&amp;#x200B;

I have all the time in the world to devote to streaming, I have done over 400 videos on my YT and coming up to 150 streams on Twitch in just over a month, I live my life as it is on stream and YT now, it is therapy and keeps me alive, its my fight against depression, suicidal thoughts, PTSD, grief, ADHD, somewhere on the autistic spectrum higher function oh and bowel cancer.

I am not going to be the next big thing, if one person watches a cooking video I make or someone laughs at my stream then I am okay.

It keeps me going better than therapy or medication ever could and it is enough.

&amp;#x200B;

But I can give you one simple truth, one undeniable and only undeniable truth of the universe, one day will be the last day you see your loved one, your best friend, your family, it is never when you plan for it, it is never when expected, it could be years or tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I would do anything to go back  7 months and spend one more moment with my Wife, to see her smile once more or her laugh, in 21 years of battling her illness we met so many people in Cancer wards, Renal Wards and Coronary Care unit, people who were as young as 13, rich people, poor people, vegetarians, yoga instructors, vloggers.

&amp;#x200B;

Take your girlfriend out for a meal, call your son and ask how he is, spend a night watching old movies with the family, do a BBQ, go for a walk, enjoy life and let those you love know every damn day how much they mean to you because.

&amp;#x200B;

One day will be your last with them and while you think now that all this matters, that all of this is more important, that its okay to put off the holiday for another year, it will all feel so hollow.

I am fortunate, I only have the irrational regret that I couldn't cure her illness, I know that I did everything else I could and the last time we had together was full of small talk and love you's.

Please go hug your wife, go spent time with those in your life that matter, Twitch will still be here.

Update: Wow once again an example of how amazing the Reddit community can be when something real comes along, we all have our own likes dislikes, we all have favourite games and films, but to see the reaction when something real happens the way community comes together is humbling.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the original post some of you recognise me from, this was the post and response that convinced me to stick around   [https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b4d861/thank\_you\_again\_massive\_and\_ubisoft\_you\_may/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b4d861/thank_you_again_massive_and_ubisoft_you_may/)

I just noticed I now have 161 streams on Twitch!

I have a life again.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all

&amp;#x200B;

Update 2:

I wanted to share an all too common story from my time in hospital in the cancer ward looking after Paola, we met a lovely guy, seems he knew us through his family who lived next to my mum, he was broken, you could tell just by talking to him, that smile that those of us have when its just a phantom of past memories.

He was a millionaire, worked for 6 years in Double Glazing, had his own company,  worked every day and night, his wife and child barely saw him, he always used the mantra ""once I make a million"" followed by go on holiday, take a break, spend time together, do less work.

&amp;#x200B;

His wife was diagnosed with a fast acting form of breast cancer and was dead in 3 months, money meant nothing to him, in fact less than nothing, life felt broken and grey,  all he could think about was all those wasted weekends and nights all that time away from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I have experiences most people don't, and that is a damn good thing, I hate the thought of someone else going through this pain of a young couple still in college with the world and possibilities at there feet, to be ripped away  by a terminal illness, to face 21 years of pain, to have my mum slowly fade away to early onset dementia, to see my wife slowly fade away and not being able to do anything about it, to spend 21 years in hospitals and then facing all my mental illness and bowel cancer myself alone now (if it wasn't for you people).

If I can get one person to ring a friend or make contact with family to let a loved one know how much they care, to spend a night together watching films and eating take out then its a victory.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Advice:

Take it or leave it is just personal stuff,

You don't need to spend money for someone to know you appreciate them.

A talk across your dining table can be special.

A board game can be fun

A walk around town together

A conversion on the phone

A hug

A shared episode of Forged in Fire :P

&amp;#x200B;

Extravagant stuff isn't needed to show you care, why wait for a birthday or valentines day or Christmas, why do those days matter more that the other 300+ days of the year and does a diamond  bought with money really express care and love more more than a card you made yourself ?

blsta7,"Smaller streamers, how do you keep on top of all the other things like VODs, Social Media, Networking and more?","I've been streaming on Twitch for over a year and a half and I feel like I've learned a ton in that time about livestreaming and everything else around it.

As someone who also has a full-time(ish) job of about 30/40 hours a week, sometimes I scratch my head as to how some other awesome streamers manage to keep on top of everything so well!

My own routine is to stream for maybe 20/30 hours a week in the evenings and weekend, spend time when I can posting on Twitter/Instagram, editing photos or clips for social media, highlighting streams of playthroughs so viewers can keep up with it even if they missed the stream, creating thumbnails for those VODs, working on my esports commentary when I can, interacting with my community in Discord and having fun with them... the list just goes on and on

Sometimes I slip up and some things don't get done or get left on the backburner for longer than I'd like and it kills me.

bkwgfr,[PSA] Stop thinking of viewers as some sort of currency that you can 'Grind' !," 

I posted a version of this a few years back, but lately i'm seeing a lot of people here and on social media that are 'On the grind' or 'getting those numbers up'. I wanted to talk to you all about the way we view viewership on twitch and the false information that's spread around in the community (""Just grind it bro were all gonna make it"")

&amp;#x200B;

For context the original post was made 3 years ago when I was a small but growing streamer, iv'e now been a twitch partner for 2 1/2 years and have a growing youtube channel too, so I like to think I know about some of this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s be honest for a minute, every day we are seeing posts along the line of **""how do I get viewers?"", ""Need helping getting my new stream to grow"" ""Is my growth ok?""** etc.

People often refer to streaming as a grind. That you put in the hours streaming and you will grow. This is reasonable advice but is not totally accurate. By streaming lots of hours you make yourself visible to a 'potential' audience and give them more opportunities to 'find' you...It does not. however, guarantee that this will happen. People need to drop the attitude of “I stream daily and interact with chat, why am I not Lirik/Towlee?”. News flash, there are over 2 million streamers now on Twitch, A good number of them 'stream and lot and interact with chat'

To further expand, think for a minute of the definition of a viewer. A **'Viewer'** is a single human being, who has decided that with this specific portion of their free time, is going to point a browser at your page and watch you play video games (Or paint pots or whatever, shout out to the Creative streamers) . This is their choice, not yours, all you can do is give them the chance to find you and hope that they like your stream enough that they will want to watch you some more. You are not entitled to their time, simply because you have a stream and you are putting in the hours… you need to earn their time by providing content that they want to watch. This is true for every single viewer that you encounter.

So what are the reasons that a viewer will watch your stream? And by this I mean stick around and watch in the long term (after you have got them through the door that is) -

* You are very good at the game you are streaming and they want to pick up tips or watch high level play
* You are very entertaining/funny and it is enjoyable to watch your stream
* They love this particular game a lot but can't play it themselves right now so want to watch it played anyway (In this situation you may be the only streamer or one of only a handful for this game)
* You are streaming a new game or a game the viewer has not played but wants to check out.
* There is an active and engaging community/chat in the stream and lots of discussions going on to take part in.

So now take a minute and think about your own stream, which of these boxes do you tick? do you tick none of them? Perhaps this is why you don’t have viewers. If you are in the 1-10 viewer brackets you literally could have 10,000+ other streams of the same size at any given time competing for viewers, ask yourself right now why those viewers should watch your stream over the other thousands?

Also think about discovery, what are the ways that people can discover your stream outside of the stream itself, if the answer is 0 then you are not using all the tools at your disposal. 

**Twitch is not an RPG, Time = Growth is a common misconception that is spread too easily. ‘TIME = Opportunities for Exposure’ would be a far more accurate way to think about it. You cannot grind viewers. What you can do is produce content that is entertaining enough that people will make the choice to watch it, and then give them the chance to find it (read one of the many guides on promotion to get ideas to get them through the door)**

Anyway I just had to get this off my chest.

Peace

bjutd2,After following some advice I am seeing some traction!,"I had to repost this without links. In the previous post, I had given links to Fiverr and to the mic/camera. I understood the rule to be affiliate links are not allowed but apparently, it's any links. Sorry I didn't mean to break the rules.

 

So I started streaming a few months ago. Had a very slow start. After following some advice I am now getting 3 followers a day and even a sub! Thanks, fam for all your help! I was getting frustrated but learned what I was lacking in. Now, it feels so much better.

You guys are the best!

\*\*Edited\*\*After all the responses asking about what advice I took, I had to edit the post.

1. Try to speak as much as possible. Even if nobody is watching, get in the habit of speaking. Talk about what you are doing, where you are going or what your plans are in the game. Talk about recent events. Talk about anything. Just try to keep away from ""dead air""
2. Always read the chat. Let your viewers know you are taking the time to acknowledge them. I've done it even during the worst times in gameplay causing me to wreck. During that time I got 2 followers.
3. Stay away from the biggest titles being streamed. Unless you're the next DrDisrespect, why would anyone want to watch you over him or any of the other big streamers?
4. Create and stick to your schedule.

I know the quality of streams is another attention grabber. During the time of me starting up, I had spent the time learning about making my stream quality good. Learn about bitrate and quality. Understand what settings help you best. If you need I can help you with your settings. Just hit me up.

Below are some things that can help you improve your stream and production quality.

1. Graphics are a big thing! They help you increase your production quality. You can get some professional graphics done for really cheap at FIVERR
2. Hardware is also a big thing. I hope this helps others that are just starting out. Make sure you get a good MIC and a good camera. Logitech C920s WebCam \- 69.00 | Blue Yeti USB Condensor Microphone \- $114.00

That is pretty much it. I hope this helps you! If you have any questions, just let me know.

bix2ki,"Why I gave up on my Dream of becoming big on Twitch - The Pros and Cons of my Experience Streaming over 7,000 Hours. An accurate and In-Depth guide of what you should expect from starting your own Stream!","I'm going to lay out the pros and cons from streaming for 3 years from age 21 to 24. I've spent roughly 3,000 hours live on Twitch and probably 7,000 hours total invested into improving the stream, so I see myself as a credible source for the following information. 

&amp;#x200B;

My reasoning for writing this post is to provide an accurate and **pessimistic** guide of a what you can expect from starting your own Twitch stream - Since it's becoming increasingly popular; for those of you interesting in beginning your own Twitch journey. It's definitely better to go into this truly understanding what to expect so your expectations aren't totally crushed. *This post is not to deter you from streaming; It's simply to clear up the air of what you can expect.*

&amp;#x200B;

**I want to make something really clear**. I do **not** regret my choice to begin streaming, for those of you who were curious. I may also stream occasionally; but **I will no longer be taking it seriously**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Number One Wake Up Call:** I want to ground those of you who expect you'll start streaming and ""somehow blow up"" because it does not happen and will never happen unless you have some sort of extraordinary talent, niche, or skill.

&amp;#x200B;

**The first few months**

You're going to begin streaming without anybody watching you. People will not randomly ""come to you."" You will have to go out of your way to find the ""**anchors**"" of your stream. Whether it's your friends in real life, or random people you meet on League of Legends after games. It will teach you the people who are really there for you and who's totally fake. It's a lot of hard work in this phase and can be pretty demoralizing; but continue to make relationships and stay consistent to create your own small community. I remember the feeling of having people *actually* chat on my Twitch for the first time. It was exhilarating; I felt so blessed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Benefit of ""Being a New Streamer""**

If you're just starting your stream; you have a hidden secret passive called ""New Streamer."" It basically helps garner the interest of those around you because people love things that are fresh and new. Especially if it comes across unprofessional or desperate. You will receive words of encouragement from most people, but will also occasionally encounter the hater.

&amp;#x200B;

**Once you have a Small Community**

By small community I'm referring to around 20 people who occasionally show up to your streams to say hello, and perhaps 6 people who consistently show up at your stream. At this point achieving affiliate is totally possible. You'll probably have around 100-200 followers at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Quick Note about Twitch Affiliate**

Twitch Affiliate can feel pretty awesome to unlock. I remember how exhilarating it was to actually have the godlike ""Sub Button."" I felt such a high when I unlocked mine; I was one of the first to unlock it - but make no mistake; affiliate is not as big of a deal as you'd think. As a ""veteran"" Twitch Affiliate, I feel it would be extremely simple to achieve affiliate in less than a month if you know exactly what you were doing. Congratulations on it, but you have *not* ""made it."" You will probably not become the ""next @Shroud"" or ""next @PhantomL0rd"" and it will only demoralize you **if you fail** if you take the approach of going into streaming expecting to become huge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Your game and your Community**

It's in your best benefit to stream the same game consistently. I'm not saying you *have* to... but you're more likely to have return viewers if they're watching the game they first saw you playing. Your community will reassure you that ""you can play whatever you like"" and they say that because **they love you**. But the truth is you'll pull more viewers by playing one particular main game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tools to keep your community together**

**Discord:** Definitely create a discord. This will be your greatest tool for keeping everyone together while you aren't live. A lot of memories and laughter will be created here. Also a tool to notify your community that you're going live.

**Twitter**: I sucked at using my Twitter but I'm under the impression it can help you gain great exposure @LinkListenn to see the sort of stuff I would tweet out (When I actually did)

**Instagram**: Something I never utilized, but a small E-Sports coach I met at a concert told me it's necessary to attracted followers

**YouTube:** Another failure of mine; I never posted YouTube videos because I was afraid of failing. Don't be like me. Utilize YouTube to rebound viewers between Twitch and YouTube; Even if you're small.

**SnapChat:** More community bonding &lt;3. I used SnapChat for awhile and created a custom group for my stream. I became lazy and unmotivated which led to me not posting pictures in it unfortunately. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Streamer Tools that I enjoyed using and recommend you to use too**

**StreamElements** Chat commands and excellent loyalty system. Good Giveaway system.

**NightBot** for the generic moderation and use of timed messages and chat commands

**VivBot** for the cool rank up system

**OBS Studio** is the best streaming software there is. Period. Free and Easy to use.

&amp;#x200B;

**Get Ready to immerse yourself in One Game for awhile; This can be a good or bad thing.**

I love League of Legends and I hate League of Legends

&amp;#x200B;

**After you've been streaming for awhile (This is what you can expect after you've learned mostly everything you can about streaming)**

Once you've figured out your streaming software such as OBS, Mastered your alerts and browser sources such as StreamLabs, On-Screen Twitch Chat, StreamElements, and figured out what it takes to run a small community and consistently provide half way decent content; Congratulations! You've got it. You're going to be pulling in somewhere between 5 and 20 viewers on most nights. Mondays and Tuesdays being the slower nights, and Saturdays and Sundays being the nights with the most traffic. I did not stream mornings so I cannot offer advice for that. Your core viewers will probably be subscribed to you and **bless them for that**. Never expect to have your twitch chat constantly moving; Although sometimes it will. It's more likely that at the start of your stream everybody will chat and as you begin gameplay the chat will slowly die down until not much is happening at all. Occasionally another person from your community will join the stream and say hello which can temporarily reinvigorate chat. But chat will not be speeding by like you see on big twitch streamers. So don't expect that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable Mentions:**

Bless my Viewers, Bless my Subs, Bless Streamelements, Streamlabs, Vivbot, and Nightbot. Bless anyone who has followed my channel. Bless anyone who has cheered bits or donated. **I love you all.** I genuinely do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Twitch taught me I could be **loved for who I am.**

\- Made some really great friends. some of the closest I've ever had.

\- Perhaps helped a few people through the darker times of life

\- Allowed me to discover who I was (and who I wasn't)

\- Showed me how to be as true of a person as I could possibly be.

\- Showed me how to handle others seeing the absolute worse of me (and best of me)

\- Taught me how to handle the worst in people, but also experience the greatest in people.

\- Taught me how to dedicate my time and energy into one singular task

\- Taught me how to bring a small community together &lt;3

\- Showed me how to structure my life around a passion

\- It was pretty cool receiving a small paycheck at the end of the month. (Although I did not stream to make money)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lack of Viewers early on.

\- Learned how to deal with Haters; You surely will run into them.

\- Deterred me from perusing something more meaningful in life. Whatever that means.

\- Gave me false hope I could be something I was never meant to be.

\- Sank quite a bit of money into PC setup, giveaways, props for stream. -Around $1,500 on giveaways (I almost didn't want to list this under cons because I ran giveaways out of the joy and love in my heart of giving. Not to gain anything.

\- Nearly became an Alcoholic to ""hype"" myself up to entertain others and force a talkative mood.

\- Can be extremely demoralizing and depressing if you take the wrong approach to the situation.

biprxy,"I only watched 0 viewer streamers today, and heres what I learned","So I started streaming recently and big surprise I have 0 viewers for all of my streams. So I kinda decided to snoop around and see what others are doing differently and what I am lacking of. 

So I gave myself a couple of rules before doing said research so I wont just pop in and out of their streams. The rules are:
1. I'll say hi to them and wait around for 5 minutes for them to reply me. If they dont, I'll either say something like ""streamer didnt read my msg FeelsBadMan"" and wait around for a couple more minutes then leave or I'll just leave.
2. I have to keep the conversation going, I wanted to keep them talking so I could get look at their personality and hopefully get them to open up.
3. Facecam is optional since I dont own/use one.
4. Stick around for as long as I could.

So after setting the rules I took a deep dive. In the span of 10 - 12 hours of me just jumping into random streams, I stuck around with 4 streamers and heres why.

The first dude I stuck with was very talkative. He just doesnt shut up and in a good way. He was very quick to reply which was nice. He was streaming Persona 3 at the time which I told him I had never played or seen anything about the game before. He was very quick to focus down on that and basically explained the ins and outs of the game through out his stream which genuinely made me interested in the game itself which was something I couldnt do and I really enjoyed.

The second stream I hung around with I didnt stay for long since they were at the end or their stream but they kinda extended their stream for around 30 mins just so we can chat a little more which was very cool and the guys streaming were very energetic which is also a win.

The third streamer I watched was playing The Sims 4 and I gave her 5$ to murder a child, which was funny and as soon as the donation went through her energy levels very dialed up to 100 and started having more fun. And as new viewers pop in the stayed to see what all fuss was about which was cool.

The last dude I stuck around with was just a great person to talk to but he kinda ends conversations which is kinda annoying.

The common thing all four of these streamers had was the moment they saw their chat moving, its like a spark just went off for them and they get hyped. All of them thanked me for sticking around until they ended their stream, saying that it made it easier and much more entertaining for them as a streamer. Some even went as far as saying I made their day which was very wholesome.

And for those streams I did not stuck around are mainly because they do not reply or interact with chat at all so I just left.

TL:DR: Look at your chat even if you think no one is watching because you just might miss out one viewers. Be talkative and start conversations (even by yourself) so you dont bore viewers that just tuned in. Also please watch more smaller streamers, most of them a really entertaining to watch and it would really help them out alot.

Thats all folks. Also sorry I made you guys read through all of these. And yes, I followed every single one of them and I'll be watching their streams when I get a chance.

bilwya,"Useful tip for 99% of r/Twitch, do whatever you want if it makes you happy","Streaming should be whatever you want it to be for you. You want to sit down for a few hours and play video games, maybe talk to the odd viewer? Do it if it makes you happy. Want to play some Dota with no webcam, no mic, just you and the game? Do it if it makes you happy. Want to try and make a career out of streaming? Throw some overlays on, do some marketing, and talk to everyone who stops by? Do it if it makes you happy.

I feel like there are a lot of posts on this subreddit of different people telling you either how to get big or to stop trying. I'm telling you to do whatever you want as long as you're happy doing it. There's not really a point to this post I'm just tired of some of the negativity I see here. We stream because we enjoy some aspect of it. Sure, some days are worse than others, but if at the end of the day you had a good time and/or found some way to better yourself as a person, then I'd say it was a pretty good day.

Happy Streaming, friends.

bhj3rd,I've ended my streams with raids the past week and it's been awesome!,"I'm a very small streamer. 51 followers, not at affiliate. Only ever have 2 or 3 people viewing MAX.

But this past week I've been raiding another streamer if they are at 1-3 viewers at the end of my stream.

This has been SO much fun! Seeing another streamer at the same ""level"" as me, getting the raid notification or whatever just brings me a ton of joy. I'd encourage anyone who streams with even 1 or 2 viewers to end their streams like this. Find new people, interact with them for a bit, and watch their day get made!

Today I found a fellow APEX PC player who is not only a solid streamer, but was a ton of fun to interact with in chat and my 1 other viewer ended up following him so it was a win-win!

Maybe try it? You might be surprised how even when you finish your stream you're still bringing joy to others, and that's why we stream after all isn't it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/bhj3rd/ive_ended_my_streams_with_raids_the_past_week_and/,1556259914.0,88,0.9,37,Twitch,KingBretticus

bgpf83,Found a random 0 viewer streamer and made his night! (Nice little story),"I was bored so I felt like giving a new guy a view, decided to go to the Minecraft section just for the memes (never watched before) and scrolled all the way to the bottom. My only requirements were 0 viewers and a facecam. 

Joined and said hi, we was super talkative and interactive before I even made myself known. He had a total of 36 historical views and 4 follows. I gave him a follow and he was really happy... but it gets even better!

I sent the link of his stream to my discord video chat with 4 other friends in it. They all joined and chatted with him making jokes he didn’t understand. We doubled his followers and got him 5 viewers for a while and he did a great job.

He had a donation section in his overlay which was empty. One friend wanted his name to be there so he donated $5, and then my other friend decided to 1-up him and donate $10! He afterward said we “lifted him up immensely” and it made me happy!

bfdepp,[Twitch Mobile] I’m getting extremely loud Fortnite ads every 5 minutes on VoDs older than 1 day.,"I’m sick of having my eardrums blown out because Twitch doesn’t know how to balance their audio or because they’re trying to milk money from me. 

If anyone has a solution to this godawful problem, or if a Twitch rep sees this and sends it in as a bug report, I’d be much obliged. 

Seriously, I usually leave VODs on in the background and I have no clue as to when the ad is going to start, so I just have to listen to the extremely loud horn in the first five seconds that every ad seems to have now. 

My phone’s audio is usually at 65% and even higher for some streams because I’m hard of hearing, but it seems like Twitch ads are at 120% volume.

And that’s only the first half of the problem, considering I keep getting the same ad every 5 minutes. If anything can convince me not to play the shitty new mode in your battle royale, it’s an Inception style BWAAAH in the first few seconds of your ad, repeated ad infinitum until either my ears are bleeding or my phone has vibrated out of my hand. 

It’s like Twitch knows when a VOD is older than a day and goes “Ah, fuck it, no-one’s gonna watch this. Plaster it with ads”. This is especially annoying for me because I usually never get to watch a stream until a few days after it’s aired. 

Please fix this issue Twitch, Amazon or Jeff Bezos. Fuck it; God, if you’re listening, please smite the dev that cranked the ad volume to 300% down with holy anger. Do me a favour and bitchslap the guy who made the ads play every couple of minutes too.

bf1azr,Using Twitch as a hobby enhancement,"This post will hopefully give someone the direction they need. Especially someone who believes twitch will be an easy way to play games and get rich.

First I want to comment on how I use twitch. I, like most, was first attracted to twitch by watching big streamers (Dr.Disrespect/Lirik/etc.). I found that I really enjoyed having it on in the background as I worked. They were funny, entertaining, and looked like they were having a blast. So I, like many, thought “hey I can do that!”. So I created my own channel and began streaming. Sound familiar?

Lately I’ve grown to love the small streams. People like you and others out there just trying to put on a good show. It’s my habit at work now to find one of  you or a very small 0-3 view streamer and provide that person the best audience member experience I can give. Interact. Ask questions. Give them the type of experience i would long for as a streamer. This is an incredibly rewarding experience and I recommend it to all of you as a way to network and help someone else. 

Unlike many here, I don’t have high goals for my stream. Like the title of my post, I really just see twitch as another arm of my already existing gaming hobby. I know my limits. I’m married. I have a full time job. I’ve got a kid on the way. And as much as I love gaming, I’d be doing myself a disservice by setting my goals so high. So for now I stream when I can and whatever game I want to play. I recommend that 99% of new streamers here do the same

Seeing some of the recent posts of people failing has been eye opening and shocking to me. 

Twitch should first and foremost be a hobby for you. There are strategies documented 7 ways to Sunday on this subreddit on how to make your Channel more appealing/attractive. However at the end of the day, people are either going to find you fun to watch or not. It doesn’t matter if you stream 1 hour a day or 8 hours a day. 

This isn’t a discouragement or an argument against  a solid streaming schedule. However, it is a PSA that just because you’ve streamed consistently for 6 months or 6 years, that doesn’t mean you’re going to have a solid following or more viewers. 

I disagree with the consensus that Twitch is oversaturated with streamers. I do think, however, that Twitch is oversaturated with streamers who think they’re going to be an instant success. When I watch small streams, it’s incredibly easy to tell who is dying for the next follower and who is having fun and putting on a show. You’ve seen this as well and I would be willing to bet that the streamer having a good time is much more interesting to watch than the one who has “path to affiliate” as their game description.

If you simply stream as a hobby and show the audience that your engaged and having fun, I’m willing to bet that you naturally grow your channel more successfully than someone who wants to make this their full time job. Unless you already possess a successful YouTube channel, or blog, or maybe you’re a large public figure, DO NOT make it your short term goal to do stream for a living. 

Use the tools provided in the subreddit to help you and set the correct foundation for a successful channel. however I think the majority of people writing about how twitch streaming has ruined their life or crushed their dreams, simply set themselves  up for failure.

Maybe your hobby will eventually turn into your dream job, but it won’t happen overnight. Until then, don’t lose focus on your real job, school work, family, etc. 

If you’re just now thinking of creating a channel, Set reasonable, achievable goals for yourself. I guarantee the experience will be more rewarding than trying to be a Twitch affiliate raking in the subs and donos by next week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/bf1azr/using_twitch_as_a_hobby_enhancement/,1555692265.0,590,0.96,102,Twitch,Lord_JeffreyMTSD

bbuejc,[PSA] Feeling Burnt Out? It's okay to take a break.,"Like all streamers, I understand that grind to get as many followers, viewers, and subscribers as possible. But eventually, you come to a point where you are burnt out and lose the desire to stream. This is a sign.

&amp;#x200B;

That sign is you need a recharge. You need a break. And that's okay. Just like anything else, it's okay to take a step back and enjoy time to yourself. To recharge.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself, have recently become burnt out. I used to stream every single day. Until I start streaming every other day, and then eventually losing my desire to go live. Yes, some of it had to do with seeing a lack of growth, but that wasn't the deciding factor. It came to a point where I just wanted to play games and not broadcast.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm not the only one who likes to game and not stream. But I'm also not the only one to figured I might as well stream if I'm going to game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I had plenty of awesome moments on stream, I have a hell of a community in my chat. But at the end of the day, I was streaming for myself. And I was slowly starting to not enjoy it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I figured it was time to step back, take time to myself. Take back my love of just gaming. And maybe someday soon I have to urge to go live again. My followers and friends all support me in my decision. Others not so much. Which is hardly a big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not good for your mental health to force yourself to do something you don't enjoy.

I just think it's paradoxical to feature a chat when you can't talk to your viewers, your viewers can't talk to each other and their messages aren't really going to come across.

It’s interesting to realize that, for really big streamers, the chat goes from being a bunch of individuals expressing their thoughts to an entity of its own. In fact, the streamers refer to it as ""chat"". It's like a mass that has taken shape. It's not even like a fanbase, it's...

b9e1lo,How to automate transitions in OBS for creative overlay effects.,"Hey Everyone!

So our first guide went over how mask out an image and apply a custom scene in OBS 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ax60nb/how\_to\_create\_custom\_overlay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ax60nb/how_to_create_custom_overlay/)

The second guide shows how to find free green screen videos and make a green screen animation 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/aztlcg/how\_to\_create\_an\_animated\_green\_screen\_overlay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/aztlcg/how_to_create_an_animated_green_screen_overlay/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**This guide will focus on creating automatic Overlay Transitions to your stream.**

1. Download the advanced scene switcher from

[https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/advanced-scene-switcher.395/](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/advanced-scene-switcher.395/)

2. Copy the DLL file into your OBS Plugins folder.

3. Restart OBS

Now we will create your new scene sequence. For this part we will be using an example of creating a sequence where smoke appears and you disappear. Create a new scene. 

1. Place your main scene in the newly created scene

a. I do this instead of placing the camera source as that scene can be used for everything. If you make any modifications to your main camera (say make yourself smaller/bigger) it will automatically update in your overlays.

2. Add a media source and choose your desired animation (in this case smoke puff animation)

3. Right click your media source and select filters

4. Add a chroma Key

a. Can adjust chroma key to clean up image and get rid of green halos

5. Position your animation on your screen

a. May want to put animation on loop during this to make it easier to place (just make sure to turn it off later)

6. Duplicate your scene

7. Turn off your camera source in your duplicated scene

**Now we will create the automatic transition**

1. Gauge how long between the original scene and the duplicated scene want before it transitions (example 1-2 seconds)

2. Go to tools and select advanced scene switcher

3. Select the “Scene Sequence” tab

4. Select your desired sequence (example: smokepoof1 switch to smokepoof2)

5. Enter in the desired transition time (1-2 seconds for example)

6. Press the “+” icon in the bottom left

a. When you have multiple transitions you can use “save round trips” to back up all your sequences

7. **PRO TIP:** When you want to edit already created scenes, go to the “General” tab and select “stop” under the line “advanced scene switcher is:”

a. This will stop the scenes from switching around when you are trying to make edits. Just remember to turn them back on!

8. You are now ready to go, you have to create a return 'poof' when you come back too by doing everything in reverse from above.  Sometimes video won't play from one scene to the next if you use the same media source, to fix this just create another media source and select the same animation.

&amp;#x200B;

b93001,Twitch should have an “emote bank”,"So with the recent allowance of more affiliate emotes, the twitch staff I can imagine are overrun with emote submissions, and while I’m sure the worst of it is over (as less people will be able to submit additional emotes as each tier is unlocked since it requires more sub points) I do think it brought up the need for some kind of tool for affiliates and partners that are not in good standing (since they have to have their emotes manually reviewed too) that allows emotes to be uploaded once, and then seamlessly be able to upload and take down from a set of emotes that have already been manually reviewed. Myself and several other streamers downgraded their tier 2 and tier 3 emotes to tier 1 once the new slots became available, and I feel this just made unnecessary work for the staff who had to review emotes that have already been approved. With this kind of system, these streamers could just delete it from one tier and add it to the next. This would also be great for streamers who want their viewers to have a rotating set of emotes. I have seen some affiliates with 10+ emotes commissioned for them but only 3 slots, so they just delete and rotate the emote once a month, but that means viewers may not have access to these emotes for days while they are reviewed (even though they have been approved in the past)

I’m sure a feature like this would take time to program and add in, probably more than what the twitch staff have to spend to review these emotes, but I do think this would really cool to help smaller streamers experiment with their branding and allow users to get the full value of their subs.

b8ms2z,"Twitch should link some categories together, such as editions/expansions/remasters of the same game","There are a bunch of games in the GiantBomb database that Twitch draws upon which divide up potential viewers/walk-ins. Games with expansions or DLC or which have had HD remasters can make it difficult for streamers and viewers to choose the right category.

I think the best solution to this would be to link these categories together, so no matter which category you click on, you see all of the streams associated with all of the games in the linked categories. I could understand if it's too difficult for Twitch to police the linking themselves, so allowing users (Affiliates/Partners) to create or suggest links and report errant links could help.

b7x8mx,"I was told my stream is too « try hard », is it or is this person delusional ?","Hi,

I’ve been wanting to start streaming for a couple years now but never got around to it. So last week I did my « first » stream and I got around 20 viewers average for the duration (5 hours), some people who came by said I was try-Harding too much etc.

I’m French Canadian so I streamed both English and French, for the stream I did French because 99% of the people watching were French. I advertised on Facebook, Twitter etc and I got a logo, overlay etc professionally made. 

Some of the viewers were saying I was trying too much for a first stream and that my set up was unnecessary (dual PC stream, Mic with arm/pop filter/shock mount...) but it’s not like I bought those things for streaming, I’ve owned them for a long time now.

Should I even answer to people saying that or it’ll make it worst ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/b7x8mx/i_was_told_my_stream_is_too_try_hard_is_it_or_is/,1554092432.0,384,0.9,199,Twitch,MyzMyz1995

b7mt5x,Intermittent Audio/Video Looping When Watching Stream Back,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried searching for this issue a bit, and i can't seem to find any solution to the problem.

When i watch back videos of past streams on twitch (meaning i don't stream myself, i only watch back), every 10 or 20 seconds, the video/audio loops back 5 seconds, plays out those 5 seconds and then continues normally again, for approximately 20 seconds.

This repeats over the ENTIRE VIDEO.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the cause for this, and is there a fix?

This happens on every video, on every channel for me.

Inb4 ""restart your PC""... I mean, it should be pretty obvious that's the first thing i tried...

b74vh3,"PSA to partners: I wore my Twitch partner hoodie yesterday, and I think I was followed home because of it. Be careful out there!","I'n still going back and forth between trying to convince myself that it was nothing, and full-blown moments of panic and paranoia. Here's what happened:

For context I am a petite, middle-aged, female partner. I am not and will never be huge on Twitch because of my content (non-gaming and no, I'm too old to be a boob streamer). I have a few pieces of partner swag including a couple of TC hoodies. 

Yesterday I wore my TC 2018 hoodie which has ""PARTNER"" in big white letters on the back. I ran a couple of errands and started driving home. A couple of blocks after leaving the freeway (short freeway segment, only 3 exits from where I was to my home exit), I noticed a car following me pretty closely. My area is a weirdly rural suburb, with only a few main streets and we were on one of the side streets. The car kept following but after about half a mile they stopped at the stop sign behind me and a young man jumped out. I figured they'd dropped their guy off and would turn down a street. There were still at least two more young men in the car.

Instead they continued behind me for another mile and a half, into the clearly marked ""NO OUTLET"" street that leads to mine, then up my also clearly marked ""NO OUTLET"" street. I (in hindsight I should NOT have done this) turned into my driveway. I thought there was still a chance they were visiting someone on my cul-de-sac. Instead the car pulled around the cul-de-sac and stopped in front of my house. I grabbed my phone, punched in 911 and got ready to hit connect. I was not leaving my car (which is not anything anyone would want to carjack and got rear-ended last weekend anyway 😂). After what seemed like a fucking eternity but was probably less than a minute, my neighbor across the street came out of his house and the car took off. My neighbor thought they were strange too - nothing ever comes up our street that isn't a resident, cop patrol, or delivery. 

I could not for the life of me think of why anyone would follow me home though?  - and then I realized I was wearing a partner hoodie. I will NEVER EVER EVER wear one in public again, especially not if I'm alone. 

I don't know for sure that this wasn't all some big mistake. They just got lost. They're high. Who the fuck knows? But as I started to put the pieces together - taking off when the neighbor came out, the hoodie identifying me - it started to make a terrible kind of sense.

I cannot properly express how terrifying it is to be a tiny woman followed home and blocked in the driveway by strange men who now know where I live. Again, I don't know if there's a Twitch connection, but just in case, everyone please be careful out there. ❤️

Edit: Thanks for all the advice, guys. I know that in hindsight I shouldn't have gone home, but with the way the streets here are (you can be behind the same car for miles) I wasn't sure they were following until it was too late and I panicked. I already knew all of the things you're supposed to do, and they just went right out of my head.

I spoke to the senior lead officer for my neighborhood tonight and she agrees, it could have been the hoodie, could have been random, we just don't know. The thing that makes me keep leaning toward the hoodie is since I never left my car between the store and home and they were (assumedly) behind me the whole time, they couldn't have seen that I was a woman driving alone (big van, dark windows, they were in a low car). So it still could have been random but if they saw me there and just decided to target me, why follow me that far on the freeway and then a couple of miles on the street? 

I'm sure I'll stop going over it in my head at some point. Thank you all so much for the support and advice. We do have dogs, guns, and a security system but none of them did me any good when I wasn't actually in the house.

b6rgg5,"PSA: If you're watching a streamer and they're having sound issues, PLEASE TELL THE STREAMER - don't just click in, hear the audio, and then leave!","I want you to imagine, for a moment, that you and everyone else in the room can hear something that a single person is 100% unable to hear, and that person is a public speaker or a lecturer. 


**Let's make a ridiculous example:** Let's say that you constantly hear your teacher loudly farting while teaching you all math. Nobody says anything, everyone hears it, everyone smells it, but your teacher doesn't know because he / she does not have her hearing aids in. Probably a bad example but...

Something similar happened yesterday on my stream. I had the worst static noise being played on my stream, but it was completely inaudible to me. I am not deaf nor hard of hearing. It was just an audio issue with my mixer.

I just got done watching the VoD and I thought to myself, ""Jeez, this is why everyone left?!"" It was an hour before I at least attempted to fix the problem. It was a wiring issue. So now I'm going to spend my Friday evening shopping for the correct wire / converter.

**TL;DR - I was giving off terrible static noise, nobody told me till an hour after I started, I tried to fix the problem but couldn't.**

EDIT: there are people here saying that it's not the viewers obligation and that's true. I've even seen people say that they told some streamers about audio issues and they get blown off, insulted or ignored. **speaking purely from my experience**, *my audio issue last night* was a sound that my viewers could hear but I could not. I went back and watched the VOD and at some stretches my audio issue did exist and in others it did not.

b66vqr,"Show ""🔴Live Now"" automatically on your Twitter Name when you're live","Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk about a new application I just released called Twitter Name Live. Its name suggests the general premise, but I put together a brief video explaining a little more in depth below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Application:** [https://twittername.live](https://twittername.live)

**Explanation Video:**  [https://twitter.com/CodeSpent/status/1109634906181775361](https://twitter.com/CodeSpent/status/1109634906181775361)

&amp;#x200B;

**A little more about what happens behind the scenes:**

When you register, we subscribe to your Twitch events on the ""streams"" endpoint so we can see when your channel is online &amp; offline. When an event is received that you've gone live, ""🔴Live Now"" will be prepended to your Twitter display name indicating to all of your followers that your stream is currently live. During this time, we will also collect your current display name at the time so when your stream goes offline, your name is changed back to what it was before the stream.

&amp;#x200B;

**About authorization permissions:**

I do go over this a bit in the demo video, however, I leave out one important concern, Twitter permissions. Unfortunately due to limitations on Twitter's API, I must ask for more permissions than needed. I do not touch anything other than your display name, however, Twitter *only* offers [3 authorization groups](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/apps/guides/app-permissions.html) to which I went with the lowest accesses possible.

As well, there was an issue where I was asking for permission to see Twitch subscribers, and this was an error. The change has been made to remove this, however, some users are reporting it still being there so I'm actively looking into caching issues. I do not need permission to your subscribers, only when you're online/offline!

&amp;#x200B;

**What's the cost/catch?**

None at all. This is 100% free, no advertisements, and I just rely on donations for server hosting costs so if you're feeling generous &amp; like the service there is a Patreon link! Otherwise, feel free to enjoy at no cost, this was just a fun project I'd like to get in the hands of others to help solve the problem of spammy ""Going Live"" tweets.

&amp;#x200B;

**Great, now where do I register?!**

Register at [https://twittername.live](https://twittername.live) &amp; feel free to ask any questions in this thread! Thank you for checking this out, and as always be sure to recommend new tools to me at any time!

b65c0j,The EU Directive on Copyright and you,"First of all, I am not a lawyer, I am not your lawyer and this is not legal advice.  
I, however, am someone who took interest in copyright laws and among other things had the opportunity to debate on this topic with one of the authors of Czech copyright laws. I don't know every caveat of these laws, but I probably know a little bit more than average Joe.

&amp;nbsp;

With that out of the way, as you all probably know the European Parliament has passed the **Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market**.  
Here's the full text as it was submitted to the EU Parliament on 26th of March 209: [LINK](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2018-0245-AM-271-271_EN.pdf). Not only feel free to study it, but I'd urge you to read at least the controversial parts for yourself (although I will be quoting from them).
The actual provisions start at page 86.

###First of all, some definitions

**information society service** - defined by *f point (b) of Article 1(1) of [Directive (EU) 2015/153](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L1535)*
&gt; ‘service’ means any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services.

&gt; For the purposes of this definition:

&gt; (i) ‘at a distance’ means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present;

&gt; (ii) ‘by electronic means’ means that the service is sent initially and received at its destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and entirely transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means;

&gt; (iii) ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’ means that the service is provided through the transmission of data on individual request.

&gt; An indicative list of services not covered by this definition is set out in Annex I;

**online content-sharing service provide**

&gt; means a provider of an information society service of which the main or one of the main purposes is to store and give the public access to a large amount of copyright-protected works or other protected subject matter uploaded by its users, which it organises and promotes for profit-making purposes.  

&gt; Providers of services, such as not-for-profit online encyclopedias, not-for-profit educational and scientific repositories, open source software-developing and-sharing platforms, electronic communication service providers as defined in Directive (EU) 2018/1972, online marketplaces, business-to-business cloud services and cloud services that allow users to upload content for their own use, are not ‘online content-sharing service providers’ within the meaning of this Directive

&amp;nbsp;

After that, several articles deal with provisions for scientific and educational purposes. Neither of those really apply here.  
Preservation of cultural heritage doesn't apply either. But it means that you museum of national film history is fine.

###Article 15 - Protection of press publications concerning online uses

While not directly Twitch related, it's one of the things talked about.  

&gt; Member States shall provide publishers of press publications established in a Member State with the rights provided for in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29/EC for the online use of their press publications by information society service providers.

Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC:

&gt; Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part

Article 3(2):

&gt; Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them

This is the dreaded **Link Tax**.  
However it also says this:

&gt; The rights provided for in the first subparagraph shall not apply to private or non-commercial uses of press publications by individual users.

Means you can send your friends texts of news.

&gt; The protection granted under the first subparagraph shall not apply to acts of hyperlinking.

Means you or Google (etc) can link to articles.

&gt; The rights provided for in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of the use of individual words or very short extracts of a press publication.

Means you or Google (etc) can still do short previews.

Also these rights expire 2 years after publication and do not apply retroactively as well.

### Article 17 - Use of protected content by online content-sharing service providers

Yes, this is what we formerly knew as Article 13. The Meme ban. Or not, but I'm getting ahead of myself here.

I'll try to cut it down a bit here:

&gt; An online content-sharing service provider shall therefore obtain an authorisation from the rightholders referred to in Article 3(1) and (2) of Directive 2001/29/EC, for instance by concluding a licensing agreement, in order to communicate to the public or make available to the public works or other subject matte

&gt; Member States shall provide that, where an online content-sharing service provider obtains an authorisation, for instance by concluding a licensing agreement, that authorisation shall also cover acts carried out by users of the services falling within the scope of Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC when they are not acting on a commercial basis or where their activity does not generate significant revenues.

Alright so you might be asking the hell this means.  
Let's take Twitch. They're definitely an *online content-sharing service provider*. We're the users.  
Significant revenue will likely be in millions of euros per year.

So if Twitch is able to reach agreement with game publishers/studios (rightsholders) to have games streamed on Twitch, the right also automatically transfers to absolute majority of streamers (*RIP Ninja \s*). Probably all of them.

&gt; If no authorisation is granted, online content-sharing service providers shall be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public, including making available to the public, of copyright-protected works and other subject matter, unless the service providers demonstrate that they have:

&gt; (a)made best efforts to obtain an authorisation, and

&gt; (b)made, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information; and in any event

&gt; (c)acted expeditiously, upon receiving a sufficiently substantiated notice from the rightholders, to disable access to, or to remove from, their websites the notified works or other subject matter, and made best efforts to prevent their future uploads in accordance with point (b)

The language is vague in several ways and essentially reads ""if you receive notice of copyrighted work you have to take it down ASAP and you should be fine"".

The Article 17 also takes into account size of providers and available technology

&gt; the availability of suitable and effective means and their cost for service providers.

So there is gonna be more expectations for YouTube than for some small (in comparison), national-scope streaming service.

For even smaller and newer services there are some exemptions too.

&gt; Member States shall ensure that users in each Member State are able to rely on any of the following existing exceptions or limitations when uploading and making available content generated by users on online content-sharing services:

&gt; (a)quotation, criticism, review;

&gt; (b)use for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche

The memes are safe. Reviews too.

&gt; The application of this Article shall not lead to any general monitoring obligation.

Rightholders are entitled to some information on how providers try to prevent copyright violations, but this limits the scope. There are some extra details too.

&gt; Member States shall provide that online content-sharing service providers put in place an effective and expeditious complaint and redress mechanism that is available to users of their services in the event of disputes over the disabling of access to, or the removal of, works or other subject matter uploaded by them.

In other words users will have ways to combat takedowns.

And some other legalese I didn't find particularly important.

###What happens now?

Member states of the Union will now have 2 years to draft, refine and pass laws to comply with this directive. 

However, during this time the directive can be tried in court.  
And there are election to the European parliament in now less than 2 months. This can also shape future of the Directive as the new MEPs can revisit this decision and pass more amendments or straight up annul it whole.

But let's just say the Directive will stand as it is and let's go through some points.

**How will the laws work?**  
We don't know exactly, they can and will be different from country to country. Germany for example already has pretty strict laws in place, however they haven't been enforced too much.

**What about memes?**  
They're safe.

**What about reviews?**  
They're safe.

**Can I play Katy Perry playlist on my stream via Spotify?**  
You can't do that now, nothing changes in regards what you can legally do in this case.  
*Note: You can play Katy Perry if you have a license to do so and you cannot use Spotify on twitch as per their ToS.*

**Can I stream games?**  
This is already technically breaking copyright laws, however game publishers seem to not push the issue simply because it is essentially free marketing. In fact many publishers actively work with streamers and pay them.  
I have no reason to believe that publishers will all of a sudden try to change things around in this regard.  
Music in games (as in real songs like you'd find in GTA games) on the other hand is different beast and I believe that Twitch would have to negotiate with music publishers.  
I think there will be more negotiations between game and music publishers to include game streamers and video makers as having license to broadcast that music under condition it's coming from the game.  
Alternatively we'll see rise of stream friendly modes in settings.

**Can I stream guitar hero?**  
Well, in regards to previous point this is gonna be mess. Especially custom music will likely need *you* to have your own licensing agreement with publisher of said song.

**How will the upload filter work like?**  
For Twitch as a live service it will probably not be an issue. Implementing real time filter would be cost ineffective and probably near to impossible with current technology, so they'd be exempt.  
For VoDs? Different story and they might have to expand a bit there, however they already do mute segments with copyrighted music so the system is already in place.

**Where will this lead? What will they restrict next?**  
I believe this is the biggest worry of the people like Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf.  
We don't know and obviously if you're of voting age and if you're from EU you can influence who will discuss such measures next.

**OK, so let's say they make these laws. Will they be enforced?**  
That's another question we don't know an answer to. Most of them probably not really. Many of the ""changes"" do not actually change much at all.  
As I mentioned before, Germany has broadcasting law and streamers from Germany technically need to purchase expensive broadcasting license. I think it happened only couple of times to big streamers and they still got big discounts on it.

**Will Twitch abandon EU?**  
I don't think so, big chunk of their userbase is from EU. That's also big chunk of their revenue.  
There will likely be changes to ToS and to the system itself.  
i'd personally expect that there will be set list of games you can stream - as they'll have negotiated license with said games' publishers.

**Are you saying it's a good change??!?**  
No. But at the same time I don't believe it will change much for the end users. There are still many legal questions that should be resolved first in the context of game streaming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/b65c0j/the_eu_directive_on_copyright_and_you/,1553698264.0,525,0.96,79,Twitch,ThePointForward

b5no5g,Anyone else skip watching people because of the Twitch Ads?,"I personally love going through the list of people I am following and seeing how they're doing and what they are doing.

I agree that Twitch can get alot of money by showing ads for bigger streamer and its fine I think. I know what kind of content im looking for so I dont mind waiting.

b3v6k5,ads being played without broadcaster starting them?,"recently two streams (non-english) that I've been watching for months have started to play ads without the broadcaster themselves playing them. It is rather annoying to have to sit through an ad and miss out on what the broadcaster is playing, especially if the game is heavy on plot etc. Sometimes its just 1 ad, but it could go up to 2-3 ads. Is this something new or is it some settings for these 2 broadcasters? I dont see anyone complaining about it in their chats though, so not sure why it seems to be only me getting these ads. All other english streams dont do this for me.

""keep an eye on this thread for updates regarding uBlock Origin. [https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/5184](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/5184) ""

\- u/NerdlyAccurate

Nothing seems to work for certain except the below solution, although it is a bit wonky.

If anyone finds a better solution please comment or make a post.

\*edit\*

&amp;#x200B;

Since twitch decided to kill ad blockers with ads every time you join a stream, I couldn't find anything that would work. Been using ublock origin since forever and it stopped working all the sudden.

&amp;#x200B;

I then found this, it's the only thing that worked for me. (using Chrome)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://github.com/instance01/Twitch-HLS-AdBlock](https://github.com/instance01/Twitch-HLS-AdBlock)

&amp;#x200B;

There is usually a bit of delay with a black screen instead of an ad before the stream starts, but it's better than having forced unskippable ads.

&amp;#x200B;

Also: If you are using this and are getting a black screen and/or ""There was a network error. Please try again."" ,

I've found refreshing or closing the tab and reopening can fix that.

b2zcqq,The difference a POSTED (and actually followed) stream schedule makes - consistency is key!,"About 6 weeks ago I finally put together a stream schedule, posted it on all of my social medias, and added it to one of the panels for my channel. This last 30 days I've tried my absolute hardest to stick to it (with the exception of a family emergency night or two), and didn't stream outside of my schedule even **ONCE**! I know I'm not pulling any kind of crazy numbers, but the [difference](https://i.imgur.com/BVtl5va.png) in consistency and support compared to just [3 months ago](https://i.imgur.com/jpMckEf.png) is astonishing! 

My stream [schedule](https://i.imgur.com/lurIJq9.png) isn't even that intense/crazy! I'm married, work full time in IT, serve on the worship team with my church, and am currently taking classes part time (online) to finish up Bachelors Degree in Information Systems. It took a few months of testing my time management skills before I felt comfortable enough to make a schedule and stick to it. As a result, I started to notice people come by/come back more often, and my channel over doubled its average viewership and tripled in sub count in that time! And this may come as a surprise to you, but my streams are usually only 2-3 hours with basically zero downtime or breaks! 

I'm in no way saying that this will magically improve the engagement and support of your own stream, but I hope that this post might help even ONE person out there who feels like they have too busy of an ""IRL schedule"" to make a stream schedule!

b2jud5,A Brief Rant About Twitch Recommendations...,"(Apologies in advance. I know that this sub has no direct relation to Twitch, but good grief, I needed to rant about this absolute stupidity.)

I've never used Twitch much, and 90% of the reasons why is the homepage recommendations. While I won't give specific names, just know that there are a couple of relatively large streamers out there that while I do not like in the slightest. In fact, I find their content and personality to be borderline insufferable. And yet for the last year I've been trying to use this platform, whenever I would open the homepage, one of these people would always either be first in the rotating currently-steaming section at the top of the page, or displayed prominently in the ""Recommended Channels"" section on the left. With of course, no reasonable way to remove them. Just needing to let them hang there like rotting grapes.

That was up until yesterday. I've finally found a few channels I'm really into, and suddenly then one of these aforementioned streamers found there way into the 'Live channel recommendation' at the bottom of the homepage. Figuring this was a way to finally be rid of this one, I click the three little dots and select ""I am not interested in this recommendation"". Check my settings and sure enough, this stream is registered; the site knows I do not want to hear or see anything from this person again.

Then I log on today, and guess what I see? Not only is the stream I blocked now _literally_ at the top of my recommended list, but it is ALSO playing front and center on my homepage. The first time any channel has managed to do both of those things at the same time, it is the channel I specifically marked less than 24 hours ago I wasn't interested in. Please explain to me in what sort of universe I live in where saying ""_I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS THING_"" apparently translates to ""_Double Down on Shoving That Exact Thing Down My Throat._""

b2ajvk,"""My stream isn't growing"" response from a Medium Size Streamer","On an very frequent basis we have threads roll through of people being confused as to why their channel isn't growing, how Twitch isn't doing enough to help smaller channels gain exposure, etc. This mindset lacks the competitiveness necessary to get ahead of streams at your tier to move up your averages. I thought I'd share some of my perspective on the path of streaming, as it may be helpful to some who struggle with understanding how growth is generated.

For context, I've been streaming full time for around 5-6 years and am working on breaking into the 1k average concurrent range, which is hard. My path to partner was to represent a road to Grandmaster league in StarCraft 2 with a focus on tilt management and learning the game. I also aimed to put in more hours of uptime than every other StarCraft streamer, with metrics on that I could track on monthly Liquipedia forum posts. This year I've been keeping up 60-70 hours of uptime most weeks.

Getting partner is hard. There are tons of smart, entertaining, and good looking people streaming on Twitch these days, and to grow your channel you need to be able to identify a few clear reasons why a viewer would choose to watch YOU instead of the other established channels in the market. The industry is really competitive now, and you need to respect the competition. Reading stuff about networking and whatnot I think misses the core point of what makes a stream grow: **High quality content supplied in the highest quantity you can give**

[This is a highlight of a rant I went on regarding the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j78xvPKufk) which will only be brought up more as the streaming scene continues to grow.

**tl;dr** Answer these questions for yourself before making a ""Why is my stream not growing?"" thread:

 * What is my purpose for streaming on Twitch?

 * Am I streaming more than the average partner?

 * What makes my stream distinct and unique?

 * How can I improve my audio/video quality?

 * What demand am I supplying with my content?

 * Do I genuinely enjoy the hourly and daily process of being online?

 * How are my skills of showmanship and charisma?

If you want to make a full-time gig out of this, you need to **absolutely embrace the ever-loving shit out of the daily grind**. You need to place a high premium on every minute of your viewer's time, and give them something worth their attention. Take care of yourself and your health, but push as hard as you can.

b1xdgf,"""RIP uBlock Origin"" - it's a much deeper problem than uBlock Origin not working. Today I got my first injected advertisement inside VLC.","See [here, about ""Surestream""](https://blog.twitch.tv/introducing-surestream-for-a-better-video-ad-experience-on-twitch-3ca5ce3287c) to know exactly what they're doing.  

When using VLC, I've had no advertisements at all, with no use for adblocks like uBlock Origin. _Now_ it seems that the only way to circumvent advertisements in Twitch is to have a start delay.  

As stated in the previous thread, I've had no advertisements for years using the VLC method of watching streams. Today was a completely different experience. 

Here is a direct snippet from the linked webpage;

&gt; We are well aware that many dedicated Twitch viewers use software that bypasses ads, and the rollout of this technology will reduce the efficacy of such software. As a company we are agnostic when it comes to the use of this software. You are free to use it, or not, as you see fit. We invested in SureStream because it helps us provide the best experience possible for the whole of the Twitch community.  

I _do_ think they have a right to run ads, but if you're paying for a service such as Prime... it needs to be changed.

b1ckdv,New Streamers Don't Have a Chance (Includes Suggestions),"It's no news to anyone that Twitch is as large as it's ever been with new streamers popping up every day to attempt to carve out their own corner on the site.  Some might even argue that more people are attempting streaming than is even realistic for the viewership and traffic currently on the platform, but without metrics on hand any real debate there is moot, and also not the point of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is that new streamers really don't have a chance on Twitch unless they are a) Bringing an audience from another platform, or b) Twitch changes their site to be more inclusive to people just starting out/on the rise early in their streaming journey by adding new ways to grow and be discovered.

&amp;#x200B;

Twitch's site has looked almost the same for five+ years, and none of the features that it has added have had almost anything to do with discoverability.  Twitch even added the ability to upload videos, but neglected to innovate or change its UI to promote or reward anyone who puts a focus on video uploading.  It's not even really clear why the feature exists if it continues to make 0 sense to make Twitch your destination for uploaded content, edited or otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

The layout of live streamers both by category and following has and continues to be set up in a way that rewards those who are already at the top.  Again, not a hot take - just a fact, and another feature of the site that works entirely against anyone trying to get started.  This layout even works against people who might attempt to play lesser known games or games that less people are streaming, because those games will always be at the bottom of the list, regardless of what that streamer might be doing to innovate or change the way that game is streamed.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I'd like to list some suggestions so this post doesn't read like so many other jaded complaints before it.

1.)  Add the option to filter your FOLLOWING list by time watched.  This will allow you to see who you watch most, and reward those streamers for keeping your attention so recently (regardless of their viewership), and conversely, allow you to see who you haven't stopped in and said hi to in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Add a ""Stream Roulette"" feature. Kind of like Chat Roulette, except it takes you to another random stream every time you click next.  This can be curated by stream tags, games, etc - all customizable before you hit ""start.""  This could also have an ""auto-play"" option, like the scan button on a car radio, will it will automatically take you to another stream after 10 seconds if you don't turn it off and decide to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Add an up and coming section.  Why this is not a thing honestly continues to be a slap in the face of anyone who has been dedicating themselves, seeing consistent growth, but getting no love from the platform they're shedding blood sweat and tears on.  Feels like a very simple thing that should have been implemented long ago.

&amp;#x200B;

4.) Add a section for browsing uploaded content that you can filter by length, upload date, etc.  Just so people have a place to go if they want to watch videos, allowing for another way for content creators to grow and bring people to their stream.

&amp;#x200B;

5.)  Add a ""suggested"" page instead of just a small list on the lower left side bar.  Have this rotate weekly instead of the same top streamers over and over.  They could even suggest games that match the tags you watch, so we can reward game variety as well as streamer variety.

&amp;#x200B;

6.)  Payout every 2 weeks.  This has nothing to do with growth as a new stream, but good lord Twitch, if Uber can pay its drivers weekly, I'm sure an Amazon subsidiary can find the resources to make faster payment a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear more suggestions that involve site change that would encourage growth to small/medium-sized streamers besides ""grow outside Twitch so you can bring it to Twitch"" and the other workaround, bandaid solutions we currently have. Thanks everyone for taking the time to read the post.  Cheers.

EDIT: Just to address a lot of people en masse who comment as if they’re the first person to suggest that networking is a thing - I feel as if most people are well aware, and don’t think that any of what I’ve suggested should serve as a replacement for all of the work that you should be doing as a streamer. I’m suggesting that the site could be better at promotion, and just general navigation that many streamers could benefit from. It’s not an all encompassing solution for streamers to grow. I only mean to suggest that from the end of Twitch as an interface, it is most definitely the platform that lends itself the least to organic growth WITHIN THE PLATFORM. I understand the need to network, make friends, be creative, stick to it, and it’s likely the last 10 people you passed this sage wisdom off to did as well. The idea that Twitch can be better as a site and the fact that streamers need to work their asses of for something that is highly difficult and competitive are not mutually exclusive ideas, so if we could collectively agree to quit punching out the straw man as some of you decide not to comment on potential changes to the UI or the addition of new features that would make the site both more interactive and also reward the hard work, that would be swell. 

Sorry this is barbed, but some of you (not all, or even most) are a bit much with the high-horsing. Not all criticism of the platform is an “excuse.” Twitch can objectively be better, and just because there’s relation to potential growth of small streamers isn’t a signal to regurgitate the same platitudes like streamers haven’t heard it before.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/b1ckdv/new_streamers_dont_have_a_chance_includes/,1552640461.0,695,0.89,306,Twitch,[deleted]

b0vc09,I think I need to stop.,"Hey y'all,

I'm sorry for posting here, I just need to vent and don't really have anywhere else to post this.

I don't know if I can keep this up. I have been on Twitch for years, under various names, and with different niches or gimmicks to draw people in.

I just got back after a year hiatus, and it was great!

...for a while. I have 2800 followers that I've accumulated over the years, but maybe 3-4 people that still show up at all. I don't think I can keep this up anymore, I feel like I've wasted months and months of my life, streaming to myself at this point.

I haven't made a dime with Twitch. I never did it for the money, but after all is said and done, I have lost money by streaming through subscriptions and giveaways and loyalty bots (deepbot) , and the like.

Yet I see countless streamers steadily grow and grow, and make connections, and have not seen anyone come back to my channel after I raid them, host them, sub to them, shoot the shit with them. It feels like an ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine"" mentality, but with my back never being scratched. It's a dumb analogy I know, but I am just kind of at a loss and having a bit of a crisis, frankly.

Clearly if people don't want to watch me that's okay, and that the core reason is it's a problem with my channel, but after all these years it really doesn't feel particularly fair. I think I'm a great streamer, and I have good evidence to suggest that's the case. But I can't keep fighting. I can't keep doing this.

I had to stop streaming today, 30 minutes after starting, when nobody except one awesome viewer showed up. I think it just all came to a head today. I don't know what to do. I think this is goodbye.

This could just be a rant and I may find myself raring to stream again on Sunday, but right now I'm at a crossroads. 

I'm sorry for posting this here, I just get the feeling there are people out there who are in the same shoes as me.

EDIT: I want to thank everyone here who has commented, you've all provided some wonderful tips. I'm going to take some time to think over the course of this week, and decide what I intend to do.

aztlcg,How to create an animated green screen overlay.,"Hey Everyone,

Here with another guide, this one will be focusing on making an animated overlay.

**Find the animation**

1. Go to youtube and search “free green screens”
   1. There are tons of free footage on youtube to find the effect you are looking for
2. I use 4kvideo.com to download youtube videos and download the video to your computer

**Creating the animation loop**

1. Open video editing software, for this I chose adobe premiere pro.
2. Open a new project and give it a name
3. Go to file and import the video file you downloaded
4. Double click the video to move into the editing area, this is where you will crop the section desired.
5. Use the “Mark In” function to mark where the video clip begins and then use “Mark Out” function to mark the end of your desired content (I and O on your keyboard)
6. Drag the video clip down the timeline area below.
7. Move into the Audio Clip/Mixer.
8. If you don’t want the audio from the video move the audio volume down to zero
   1. If you want to add custom audio just import any file (audio or video) and put it under your current video.
9. At this point your animation loop is edited, go to file and export the media.
   1. I like to use H.264 files because it makes smaller file sizes
10. Export to your computer.

**Creating Scene for OBS**

1. Open OBS
2. Create a new scene  (not your main scene, just for your camera)
3. Add your webcam/video source
4. If you want to change your skin color (Example making your face red if you are mad), right click the new scene and go to filters and add a color correction note: don't edit the camera source, make sure its the entire scene.
   1. Here you can play with your saturation, brightness, ect to get the effect you desire.
5. Create another new Scene, and place the scene within this one with your color corrected webcam.
6. Size it in the corner, and Add Media Source and select your animation file with the green screen.  Make sure you check the Loop feature.
7. Right Click the media you added and add a chroma key. Size and reposition the animation loop to where you desire.
8. Once you are finished make sure the entire scene matches your Main camera scene, so that the transition is seamless.

Hope this helps and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Below is a video tutorial if any of this didn't make sense. At the end of the video I demonstrate many of the overlays that I have created and will be doing tutorials on in the future.

 I know to everyone it looked like he just fell asleep, but moving forward what if there was a system that trusted mods or viewers can report a medical or other emergency and streamers and opt in to have emergency contact info secured somewhere. 

May be too much to implement... but idk could save a life maybe. I feel it would be pretty awful to watch something happen to your favorite twitch streamer and not be able to help.

aze0dd,How the hell do people chase the ‘full time’ dream while being in a serious relationship at the same time?,"My girl is great and she in no way is the type of girlfriend who is like, ‘You’re not allowed to play games tonight!’. I know that there’s a ton of guys in those types of relationships and I figured I should preface this post by saying that right away. 

She is just the normal girl wanting to spend time with me when she gets home from work and prefers me not tucked away in my man cave for hours and hours and hours making videos or live-streaming. Sure, she is pretty cool about it. But then it always reaches a point where she is like, ‘Okay, real tired of sleeping alone.’  

Personally, it’s totally understandable. But people who do stream and make content in general know that 7 hours into an awesome roll or stream, you can’t just be like, ‘Okay stream. See ya later!’  

So my question to full timers who are in serious relationships or marriages - How? 

And this is a totally serious post and question. I need advice to know how to juggle it.  Because she’s obviously first in my life always. But I also don’t want to walk away from something I love doing because she doesn’t necessarily ‘get’ it. 

I would really prefer you respect her and don’t automatically start making assumptions or name calling or even give relationship advice outside the question. Thank you.

az6pf1,A Dutch tv-programme is criticising streamers for receiving money from children,"The gist of it is basically: blame the gamers, they shouldn’t be receiving money if they don’t know who they’re receiving money from.

aycubc,Staff/admins suddenly entering channels and asking streamers to change from Just Chatting to other categories?,"I'm a mod for Hitch (the Hitchhiking channel) and recently we had a very weird incident. A staff member who is also a Partner Manager (not Hitch's) came into the channel and asked us to change categories from Just Chatting to Travel &amp; Outdoors. We had been streaming during and after Twitchcon SF in the Just Chatting category exclusively. However, the staff member claimed that the stream was miscategorized.

We also received reports from other viewers and moderators that this was attempted to be done on JakeNBakeLive's channel, with staff even changing the category remotely, and then moderators changing it back.

**Why wouldn't either of these streams fit the Just Chatting category?** In both channels, **the streamer spends &gt;80% of the time chatting with viewers with much of the content basically being classified as an AMA. The only difference between this and other Just Chatting streamers is the venue/location in which they're talking.**

**Does this mean that when I stream from a restaurant and spend my time primarily interacting with chat doing the same thing, I'm suddenly a Food &amp; Drink stream?**

This seems to be a major misstep by Twitch. **Why wasn't an announcement email sent about this?** **Why wasn't the TOS  or other written guidelines updated first before trying to enforce categories like this?** The way Twitch staff decided to handle this was really messy. Also can someone from Twitch SF/HQ weigh in on this? - this was occuring before start of business for them.

*EDIT: I had a conversation on voice chat with the Twitch staff member, and found that in this particular instance it was actually just a suggestion, not a requirement to change categories - however the mods interpreted this as needing to change the category on the spot. In this case, it was a misunderstanding, but after I posted this, I have been sent screen captures of emails from Twitch having a more hardline stance towards medium-size (100-300 viewer) streamers. I've also been made aware of clips of other streamers protesting category switches live.

ax60nb,How to create custom overlay.,"Hey Everyone,
I wanted to create a guide to explain how to make a really simple overlay using a transparent using a .png file, masking an area for your face, and masking your webcam. This guide will be using adobe photoshop and OBS. An example of this would be overlaying a LOL champions body but with the streamers face or a hoodie with the streamers face in it.
Here are the steps:
Creating a transparent overlay
1. Find an image you want to use to create an overlay
2. Open image in photoshop
3. Make it a regular layer (not a background layer)
4. Grab pin tool
5. Zoom in (spacebar+ctrl hotkey on pc) and start drawing outline on image that you are trying to capture
a. To outline click and drag to create bezier points
b. If overlay is going to be in corner of your stream then doesn’t have to be extremely detailed
6. Once completed go to your paths section and select the mask button in the bottom right with the dotted lines. 
a. If you don’t like what selected you can de-select using ctrl+d
7. Hold down Alt key and click your mask layer to see your mask layer
a. This will turn screen black and white. The white space (also called positive space) is where the image will show
8. If there is more you would like to photoshop out, go to your paintbrush tool and select a hard brush
9. Use the brush to remove the parts of the image you desire
a. You can use your bracket key (left and right) to resize your brush to fit your needs
b. You can draw a line by holding shift, clicking point “A” and the point “B”
10. If you haven’t already, use pen tool or the paintbrush to remove the image area that you are wanting your face to be seen seen (say the face of the LOL champion from the example above)
11. Crop the file to crop the image area to only include your overlay
12. Save the image as .png file using the “save for web” functionality
a. I use alt+ctrl+shift+S quick key to bring this up
b. PNG-24 file type is fine
c. You can adjust the resolution to lower the file size if needed
13. Switch over to OBS
14. Add an image
a. This is the .png file we just saved
15. Resize and place the image where you are wanting it within your scene
16. Add a video capture device (your webcam)
17. On your video capture device, go to filters and add a chroma key and place it around 400-420
a. Make sure your lighting is optimized this is very important
Creating an alpha mask for your webcam:
1. Go back to photoshop and duplicate your previously created layer
2. Alt click your layer to show the positive and negative fields
3. Copy this and paste into a new layer
4. Invert the image using
a. Image-&gt;adjustments-&gt; invert
5. Paintbrush black any place where you do NOT want your face (i.e. for the LOL example only the champion’s face should be white)
6. Save this mask as .png using the “save for web” functionality
7. Go back to OBS
8. Create a new scene for your alpha mask
a. This is important. If you applied the alpha mask to your main screen it would affect only your overlays.
9. Add the alpha mask .png as a source for the newly created scene
10. Under your alpha mask scene go into your filters and add an “image mask blend”
11. Select your alpha mask file and position your face to fill in area as desired
12. Go back to your original overlay scene and add your alpha mask scene
a. Under sources +-&gt; scene-&gt; alpha mask scene
13. Position and size the image behind the overlay
14. That’s it!
Sorry if this was complicated or hard to follow. Below is a video I made where I explain all this while I make an ET overlay for my stream. If you have any questions or requests please reach out!

awjios,To all streamers/followers/lurkers/subs:,"I've been noticing that a lot of my fellow streamers are going through very stressful times or having mental exhaustion issues, whether it's from irl things or from streaming itself. This is just a silly little post to remind you streamers having difficulty that your mental health is always the first priority, and never to sacrifice that for other things. You can perform so much better after you take a break. Do what it is that relaxes you for say, a day. I can guarantee it will help benefit you in the long run. 

As for the non-streamers out there, you never know what the smallest bit of support will do. A little bit can go a long way. Whether it's lurking, following a new streamer, having a pleasant little conversation, or any other little thing you can do to brighten a streamer's day. There's a lot that are struggling more than you might know.

aurrbx,"OBS Studio 23.0 Released: Twitch/Mixer integration, NVENC performance improvements, and more","**Downloads and full changelog: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/23.0.0**

---

Changelog:

You can now support OBS development on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/obsproject) and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/obsproject). Read our [announcement blog post](https://obsproject.com/blog/new-ways-to-support-obs-development) for more details.

# Service Integration (Windows)

* Added the ability to optionally connect your account to Twitch or Mixer from within OBS (with more services in the works). When your account is connected, you do not have to enter in a stream key, and gain access to special features related to that service, such as a chat panel or stream configuration/statistics panels.
* Twitch integration: Added Twitch chat panel (with BTTV/FFZ support), the Twitch ""Stream Information"" dashboard panel allowing you to change your stream title/game/etc from within OBS, and the Twitch ""Stream Stats"" dashboard panel which shows statistics such as viewer count (Stream Stats is hidden by default, you can unhide it in the View menu -&gt; Docks submenu).
* Mixer integration: Added Mixer chat panel
* Panels such as chat panels used with services are dockable; you can dock/undock the windows to customize how you want them to be placed when using OBS.
* YouTube, Facebook, and more services are still in the works; more to come soon.
* Service integration is currently only available on Windows for now, though Linux and Mac support is planned for a later date.

# NVENC and Encoding Improvements (Windows)

* A new implementation of NVENC has been added which has improved performance, reducing system and resource impact. To enable, go to Settings, Output Tab, and in Encoder select Hardware (NVENC) New. Note that the new implementation is not available on Windows 7 due to limitations in the operating system; the old implementation will be used instead in that case.

* Added new features to the new NVENC implementation:

    * Psycho-visual Tuning: Enables encoder settings that optimize the use of bitrate for increased perceived visual quality, especially in situations with high motion, at the cost of increased GPU utilization. This increases subjective image quality. Qualitative measurements like PSNR may score lower but video may appear better to human viewers.
    * Look-ahead: Enables dynamic B-frames. If disabled, the encoder will always use the number of B-frames specified in the 'Max B-frames' setting. If enabled, it will increase visual quality by only using however many B-frames are necessary, up to the maximum, at the cost of increased GPU utilization.

# General Changes

* Added a Limiter audio filter.
* Added an Expander audio filter.
* Added VAAPI video encoder on Linux.
* Added batch remuxing support to the Remux Recordings dialog.
* Added an option to automatically remux recordings to MP4 in Advanced settings.
* Added a Decklink output tool to the tools menu. This allows you to output OBS to a Decklink device.
* Added an optional Stats dock. This dock is disabled by default; you can enable this dock in the View menu -&gt; Docks submenu.
* Added multi-track audio support to FFmpeg output in advanced output settings.
* Added an About dialog to the Help menu.
* Added a filter (search) option to the Hotkeys section of the settings window.
* Added a fourth Mic/Auxiliary audio option in Audio settings.
* Added stereo balancing (panning) to the Advanced Audio Properties dialog.
* Added an option to change the OBS base/output resolution to the size of a source in the right-click context menu of the source. Only works when no outputs are active.
* Added a ""deactivate when not showing"" option to the Decklink source.
* Added an Invert Polarity audio filter.
* Added an F2 shortcut to rename sources or scenes when selected.
* Added VLC source support to the Instant Replay script.
* Added a ""What's New"" dialog that may pop up on startup in the case of announcements or important news
* Fixed a bug where screen reader tools for the visually impaired would not read out the items in the source list box in the main window when selected.
* Fixed a bug where fullscreen projectors would always be on top despite that setting being unchecked.
* Fixed an issue on windows where window capture would use an abnormal amount of CPU usage when its target window was not available
* Fixed a number of race conditions and minor memory leaks, improving overall program stability.
* When your mouse cursor is hovering over a source in the preview or in the source list, a light rectangle will show up around it indicating that it can be selected.
* When a source is dragged outside of the preview area, there is a new visualization for the unseen area of that source while selected.
* Simplified and improved the user experience of the ""Stream"" page of both the settings and auto-configuration windows.
* The source selection rectangle has been improved.
* The slideshow source now only loads a maximum of 15 images at a time, and dynamically loads images beyond that count as they cycle. This was done to prevent people who put countless files in the slideshow source from running out of memory.
* When in studio mode, you can no longer transition if you're already in the middle of a transition.
* Removed a number of internal/uncapturable Microsoft program windows from the game/window capture window lists.
* Increased the Instant Replay script retry interval.
* Docks are now unlocked by default. You can lock/unlock docks in the View menu -&gt; Docks submenu.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/aurrbx/obs_studio_230_released_twitchmixer_integration/,1551136095.0,449,0.98,185,Twitch,dodgepong

aumdc1,"Free Win Counter, Poll, and Text Overlays You Can Update in Chat.","I made these **free OBS overlays you or your mods can update just using your Twitch chat**. The idea is that mods and streamers can use commands like `!addwin` or `!pollstart` to update the overlays *live* without having to edit text files. Each overlay is customizable to match your stream's appearance. This is a beta test, so I am looking forward to hearing the community's feedback and suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

Check it out at [https://www.modoverlaysuite.com](https://www.modoverlaysuite.com) or keep reading!

&amp;#x200B;

**There are three main overlays as of right now:**

* [Win-Loss counter](https://www.modoverlaysuite.com/counter) (or optionally wins only) - Mods can keep track of wins and losses quickly in chat using `!addWin`, `!delWin`, `!addLoss`, etc.
* [Text Overlays](https://www.modoverlaysuite.com/overlay) \- Clean and simple text overlay. Text resizes to fit the box to accommodate both long and short messages.
* [Polls](https://www.modoverlaysuite.com/poll) (my personal favorite) - Mods start a poll with several options. Viewers can vote right in chat, and a graph overlay updates automatically on stream with the results!

There are videos of each of these in action at [https://www.modoverlaysuite.com](https://www.modoverlaysuite.com)

&amp;#x200B;

You can choose to use one or all of the overlays. Setup is easy, and you are **walked through it step-by-step**!

&amp;#x200B;

**No more need to use Straw Polls. No more need to update a text file to keep track of wins and losses. You and your mods can now manage all of this right in chat using Nightbot commands!**

If you don't use Nightbot, and you use some other bot I'd love to hear from you! That way I know of other bots to try to support in the future!

&amp;#x200B;

All Beta Testers will get a year of premium features (which are currently being developed)!

Enjoy and I'm looking forward to everyone's feedback! Enjoy! &lt;3

aubwnc,"For streamers who grind daily with no growth, this might help","I've seen some posts about streamers staying away from saturated games because no one wants to scroll down for 5 minutes to find a streamer. This is definitely a thing, and if you stream a saturated game, you probably know that grinding it for hours a day won't get you anywhere. This isn't so much of a guide, more so what I found to be helpful that I don't see many people post about.

Both Twitter and YouTube are very powerful. Both of these platforms I'm still in the process of learning how to use, and over the past 2 months I've been learning how to use them to grow my twitch channel. So far, I think it is safe to say that these platforms are almost **essential** if you want to grow your channel, especially if you stream a saturated game.

This stuff takes a ton of effort on top of just streaming. I've had to literally watch videos on how to effectively use twitter and YouTube to grow my twitch channel, but so far the results are pretty nuts.

As for how to practically use twitter and YouTube, I'll give brief examples of what I've been doing and link a video I found super helpful and let you guys do the rest. For twitter, lately I've been sharing a clip once a day, or every other day from a stream by attaching it as an MP4 to a tweet with a very brief caption and ending with my twitch link. Some of these clips get from 200-500 likes and retweets, and I'll get people come in my chat saying things like ""Hey, came from that hilarious clip on twitter! Nice content!"".

The same with people coming from YouTube. I make entirely different content on YouTube consisting of tutorials for the game I play. Then they can find my twitch for a more personally engaging stream where the game is secondary and chat engagement comes first. I've had tons of people find me entirely through YouTube with incentive to also watch my stream since they are 2 different types of content.

I don't want to flood this post with a shit ton of advice, but this has definitely changed the way I approach twitch since now I understand how much work some of the bigger streamers put into their channel. This type of effort is essential if you want to really make something of streaming.

Here are some videos I found super helpful:

1) Lack of Twitch servers in India.  
2) Lack of Twitch Prime.  
3) Lack of a Partnership associate to help and guide us.  


Its not that our is content is restricting us to grow but the problems mentioned above are.  


India is a very big market and Its not that there are less streamers in India. There are lot of streamers who are streaming on YouTube and few are also pulling more than 25k concurrent viewers whenever they stream.  


All the new streamers are also opting for YouTube to start because of the problems. Also, many streamers from Twitch have switched to YouTube/are thinking of switching as well.

asmj54,How do I politely tell someone that I would rather stream alone then join a discord and chat with them?,"For context I am a very small streamer and have just started to see some relative success. Today I was streaming a game in single player and had around 10 viewers and it was the first time that I had people who were actually using the chat and talking with me.

One of them was very active commenting on the gameplay and even asking me questions. I was thrilled because that is the very reason that I enjoy streaming and the guy seemed to be genuinely interested and entertained. 

Eventually I asked the question if any of my viewers played this game as well just to get their opinion. This same viewer said yes and then promptly asked if he could join in on me. At this point I got a little worried because I was quite enjoying just playing the game alone but the guy seemed really nice and had even followed me so I just said screw it and invited him in.

Immediately I could tell that I had made the wrong decision. It wasn’t like the guy was a jerk or anything quite the opposite but it seemed like he was more inclined to just chat with me while I wanted to be more focused on the gameplay. I wasn’t really interacting with the stream anymore and my small amount of viewers left quickly but I just didn’t know how to tell the guy that I would rather just play alone. 

I guess my question would be has anyone else experienced this if so how did you deal with it because I just ended up playing with the guy for the rest of the night awkwardly trying to also interact with my stream.

ary52o,The games you play are so important! - Trying to inspire other small streamers.,"Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, just for some context, I am very much a SMALL STREAMER. My channel is currently sitting at 41 followers BUT those 41 have come around fairly quickly. Also, I NEVER ask any of my friends or family to watch/follow at any point.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been streaming quite consistently since the New Year, and up until the weekend I had only really streamed Devil May Cry and Apex Legends. These are just games that I was playing anyway, and decided to stream. after each stream I would watch part of my VOD and work out what i like/dislike, then go in and make improvements where I can ( Overlays, audio, video etc. )

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last weekend I finished tweaking things and fancied playing a new game! I decided to buy Cuphead (been wanting to play it for ages) and I also downloaded RE1make as I haven't played it in years.

&amp;#x200B;

BOOM! the spike in viewership and followers was amazing! I went from barely getting 0-2 viewers and getting 1 or 2 followers here and there (not complaining) To getting a bunch of viewers and followers whilst playing Cuphead &amp; REmake over the weekend. REmake especially was getting me between 5-9 viewers consistently! People were chatting to me, asking questions. chatting amongst themselves etc. It was so much fun!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - Tweak your stream and get it to a place where you are happy with it. Play the right games for your stream, in terms of entertainment and growth.**

*Playing Fortnite and Apex Legends all day is not going to grow your channel early on. By all means, play these games if you enjoy them (I play Apex) but just be aware they are not going to pull in viewers so early on in your Twitch career.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 1 - Remember to network with like minded streamers aswell. It is lots of fun and a huge help to everyone involved :)**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2 - THANK YOU FOR READING! I corrected some grammar and spelling. Had to write this on the sly whilst at work today... Don't tell my boss! Initially, I was rather skeptical about posting this because I thought I would just piss some people off, but the response has been great! The community on** r/Twitch **seems really strong and supportive. Good job everyone. Thanks again. Love from the UK! :)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading! It was a long one, i'm sorry! Feel free to ask me anything, I'm happy to pop into your stream and say hello if you wish. Networking 101 :)

aruttt,Advice for small streamers who plan on quitting.,"Let me first say that I understand if you want to quit twitch. Live streaming isn't everybody's thing and there's nothing wrong with calling it quits if you aren't enjoying yourself. That being said, there is something you should take into consideration.

Just because you have 1 follower doesn't mean that the follower wouldn't miss you if you go. If you plan on quitting twitch entirely, or even taking an extended hiatus, let your followers know. Make a social media post, talk about it on stream, something along those lines. Because who knows? You may have that one person who has been looking forward to your next stream, not knowing it may never come to pass. I don't mean to guilt-trip by saying this at all. I'm simply speaking from the experience of being that follower multiple times before. Whenever I follow someone it's because I genuinely enjoy their content and want to be a part of their community. Naturally, some of them have decided to move on from twitch and I'll admit it is disheartening, albeit understandable. Life is what it is. However, what makes things much worse is when a streamer gives up with no warning or farewell of any kind. It genuinely sucks as a viewer, being stuck in that limbo, unsure whether or not the streamer I really enjoy will ever come back or not. So please, let your followers know if you're moving on. It may not seem like much to you, but it may mean a great deal to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/aruttt/advice_for_small_streamers_who_plan_on_quitting/,1550476104.0,103,0.81,35,Twitch,ToaJack
arlxcj,An unbelievable story of a small streamer,"Hello internet. I am about to tell you my crazy story. A story which I myself at times am finding hard to believe is real, tho here I am, living it.

I figured that so many people who do streaming actually have some unbelievable background, among which mine won't probably even rate as the craziest.

I used to be a pro l2 player back in 2006 and retired in 2009 in favor of my programming career. I brought ideas from gaming engines to BI and built my own Data Processing Engine, which is somewhat similar to a game engine by its design. Then some 5 years later I was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 Follicular lymphoma (a type of blood cancer).

My elder daughter was only 1 year old at that time. I kept working for a while. My wife became pregnant again. And before you go judging me - it was not planned. It was a pure miracle.

Just a month later, my condition rapidly declined. My disease transformed and I had 2 forms of lymphoma at that point - one indolent and one aggressive. I had huge swollen lymphs all over my body. I had a severe limp and had my head was literally double in size from neck to chin.

I had to be hospitalized for some extreme life saving chemotherapy. Something I barely came out of. I was barely breathing and moving and having caught the flu on top of that. My employer, apparently was sure my days were numbered, so he betrayed me in a way that left me completely speechless, but I cannot go into detail at the moment due to ongoing legal procedures that I am taking against him.

My programming career has come to a halt at that point. The relationship with my wife was deteriorating badly. Pretty much Breaking Bad style. Except for the methamphetamine part, my whole life was looking like that show. I did cook RSO for myself tho (prescribed medical cannabis extract).

And if that is not enough of a coincidence, my last name translates from German as ""white-man"".

At that point I found myself with not much to do between the desperate chemotherapy sessions. I didn't know how much time I had left or what to expect so I decided to check out what's been happening in the gaming realm while I was gone.

Only at that point have I found out about gaming on youtube and twitch. First time heard of pewdiepie then green pewdiepie, markplier, blah blah my mind was blown away. Then I found twitch. I couldn't believe how much everything has evolved (everything except the games themselves, GOD DAMN IT ! ... jk), the gaming culture was centuries ahead of what I remembered.

I decided to open and run my own twitch channel, but I was physically, mentally and emotionally in such bad condition that it didn't really work well. My life was a total mess and I couldn't bring myself to enjoy what I was doing. I had 0 income, a wife and two little babies. I stopped running it some time later.

Honestly, I didn't think I'll make it out. It took 13 different types of treatment. All possible conventional chemos and quite a few experimental treatments. Most treatments started well but then stopped working at around 50 to 80 percent of expected effect, each time giving me a worse and worse prognosis. From a certain point, the doctors could not give me a prognosis on my chances to survive. I was a pure test pilot for anything possible. Despite all those treatments I stayed physically fit so I was able take part in different experiments but it was all looking like a never-ending story. While I do think cannabis helped me survive this amount of medicine, tho I am certain that without the treatments I had 0 chance.

According to my doctors, my only possible chance was to somehow shrink the lymphs enough to undergo a bone marrow transplant. Lucky for me, despite my relatively rare genetic combo, somehow a donor was found in my country. A female, 90% match. Not perfect, but still very good. When I was completely out of treatment options we did something completely crazy with my doctors. We repeated a chemo that I have already done. It did again only partially work and then I was hospitalized for the bone marrow transplant. Having decent amount of disease still in me, with the only hope that the last nuclear blast of chemo that is given before the bone marrow transplant, which is supposed to kill your immune system, will shrink the disease enough for the new immune system to be able to handle. A completely crazy and desperate plan but it was the only thing modern medicine could offer and waiting was not an option.

Still, by the fact I am writing these lines right now, you can assume it was at least somewhat successful. I am 6 months after the transplant. My recent PET scans showed no sign of active disease and I have at least about 6 more months to go until I can have a normal, not suppressed immune system, which hopefully will live in harmony with my body and not let the lymphoma return.

I somewhat recovered mentally and emotionally during this time along with my physical condition. I restored the relationship with my wife and overall feel like we became the perfect couple from as far as I can tell. It goes way beyond from what I could possibly expect or imagine. So I figured this is probably my last chance to make something out of my passion for gaming, before life drags me back to write big programs for people who can't appreciate a piece of art or the artist behind it.

So I resurrected my twitch channel and some of my ideas for video games that I wanted to develop over the years. I have so much that I want to do and so little time.

I am quite a different person, now that much of my emotional pain is gone. I feel that I am finally myself. For the first time in my life. I wish I could say I am cured of all emotional pain, but ironically, the thing that has cured me also left a thousand scars on my soul. One thing I can say for sure - I do not suffer as much. The numerous doctors and nurses that fought for my life over the years, their dedication, good will and honesty helped me restore faith in human beings. I had a real tough childhood that I skipped in my story, because unfortunately, we live in a world where that's nothing special.

That crazy life, those 4 years have completely detached me from almost anything and anyone I knew. I kept in touch with very few people. My best friend, who was as close as a sister to me, has died during this period. Reason of death in unknown. I never had the chance to mourn her properly. I got the news when I was hospitalized and was under sedation. I couldn't go to the funeral and haven't visited her grave since. I keep having conversations with her in my head from time to time. It is not someone I can let go of and I want to make her a character in my games.

Why am I writing this ? Because I feel like posting my story is the right way to handle what I'm going thru right now. I believe there's much of it that needs to be heard. Especially for people who are struggling for something in their lives and need some part of their faith restored. If you ask me how I got out, I'll say at a certain point I realized I should just always do the right thing with no hesitation. I started trying to apply this to everything in my life, not only my therapy.

First I started treating myself the way that I feel that I deserve ! Started being mindful of my own thoughts and emotions. Then came my relationship with my wife. I had to remove any unpleasant behavior that I had, regardless of how right I thought I am or how angry I was. It was not beneficial to anyone. I did insist on being treated the way I want and being respected at all time, tho I learned to insist on it without fighting or being aggressive. My wife had no choice but to follow on that kind of behavior eventually. After that I could allow myself to become a more active and happy figure in the lives of my daughters. Next thing ? Here I am. Sharing my story.

9j8ib4,A story about how my viewers quite possibly saved my life.,"On Sept. 5th I got sick. It started with some pain in my stomach and developed into a fever. I typically stream 6 days a week for around 6-7 hours a day and the 4th was the last day I could do that.

My fever quickly grew to 102 and then 103.5. I took some medication but did not see a doctor. Within 2 days I broke the fever but then started experiencing other problems such as dizziness and the fever kept returning. This went on until the 13th when I did finally see a doctor at my clinic. they couldn't find the problem though and required me to go have some blood tests done and return the following week.

During this time I was updating my stream once a week to tell them what was going on and how I was doing. On the 14th I updated them again and I was in bad shape. Some of my viewers were insisting I go to the ER immediately. I told them that was not such an easy decision. I am in the USA and have no insurance. A trip to the ER is not an easy choice to make but my viewers persisted and immediately started setting up a GoFundMe telling me to go and they would handle the money for it.

I became emotionally overwhelmed with what was happening and told them that I would go to the ER right away. I had a friend drive me there and as they started running tests they found an infection in my left kidney which ended up being E.coli.

They admitted me to the hospital that night where I remained for a week. During that time they found a second infection which was staph in my blood as well as pneumonia and my stomach was full of gas which made it near impossible for me to eat for the previous week.

My viewers may well have saved my life by getting me to go to the ER on the 14th. I didn't know how sick I really was and at 47 I have become accustomed to riding things out but that wasn't working this time. They raised over $2000 between the GoFundMe and paypal donations. I ended up getting covered through an HCAP in Ohio which should cover most of the bills but does have some exceptions.

I can't begin to tell you how overwhelmed I was/am by how my viewers came together to help me when I needed it. I can never repay what they did for me. I am still going in for daily IV treatments at the hospital but I did start streaming a few hours a day again this week.

9iyjn2,Why is every post about small streamers?,"I have nothing against people streaming and trying to make it on twitch because it’s not easy. But every day I come to this sub and my feed is filled with some small streamer post saying thanks for checking them out or some roundabout way to /flex their channel. I’m sure some of these posts might be genuine but I’m also sure the vast majority is just trying to use it as self promotion. 

If you want to make it on twitch stream 5 days a week for 5 hours. Stream the same time and the same game. Set small goals for yourself. Talk non stop about what you are doing even if it’s obvious. Read your chat. Check your audio levels. Go back watch your broadcast and see if you enjoy watching it or not and fix issues from that.

You need to grow organically, giveaways, promotions, gimmicks and things of this same nature don’t really help you in the long run. 

Start a YouTube channel and upload a video every week or twice a week. 

To be honest if you don’t have time to do all of this don’t expect to become a twitch streamer. Sure do it for a hobby or just for fun but if you want to make money and pay bills you need to do all of this at the bare minimum. 

People might not like the harsh truth here but someone needs to be the bad cop here and tell everyone that in a world where participation trophies are given out, twitch will not give you anything unless you grind the long slow hours for every single viewer you convert to a regular. 

  

Edit: this was just a small rant post not supposed to be on top of the sub... Reddit mystifies me sometimes lol. 

Donate blood or plasma this week at the local blood bank in your area, make some money to buy yourself something nice.

Edit2: Yes I stream, 7 days a week 10pm-6am I have made roughly $800 a month for the last year on twitch.  I do twitch for fun not money, this is a hobby for me until I can commit myself to the job side of it.  I edited this post because info was irrelevant to the discussion.

9i8om8,"Guide to setting up a Mixer for streaming, and separating audio for discord","Hey there, a few days ago I decided to help a few people out, who've been DMing me, seeking assistance setting up their mixer for streaming, and for separating their mic audio for discord.

Well, without explaining too much, I made a [video](https://youtu.be/-zCOHcDSNzk) which covers the basics of what the Yamaha MG series mixers has, as well as the basic setup for streaming, and AUX/FX SENDs used for outputting mic audio for discord, as I said previous.

I also go into detail on how to connect a secondary input from your pc to your mixer to use for separating either discord audio, or music, so that it isn't in the same track as pc/game audio.

I hope this can help some of you, as I know many of you have been posting around lately, seeking help.

Feel free to either comment here, or on the video, and I will try to reply to any questions when I am available.

9hywo7,"Hey Twitch, here's an idea: if you want people to actually not block your ads, how about you add more than three ads in your pool of ads that play for the next 4 months.","I've been using Twitch for 9 years now and have experienced the website before the inception of ads, and after they were added.

Despite the community outrages and adblock usage option back then, I didn't block these ads at first, they weren't intrusive or annoying. There were also a larger variety of video ads that played. But then you guys started to play the same fucking ads over and over.

I understand that the ads that get played are random, but it also seemed like you removed over half of the ads from your pool. So as a result, I enabled the adblocker up until the inception of the Prime deal with no ads, because hey, I figured I might as well help support the website that has provided me countless hours of entertainment.

But now here we are, with the ads being back on the site for Prime users. The ads themselves aren't an issue, the issue is that you literally have three or four ads that constantly get played, and often multiple times at once.

Lol.//One streamer tried to find if he could return the gift to no avail! This hacker knew what he was doing 😂.

Hi everyone!

Title says most of it. I’ve donated probably once or twice and subscribed once or twice in my entire 4 years on Twitch. None of which has happened for over a year.

I woke up yesterday to 6 emails confirming my payment of all the above that occurred within a 5-minute span at 7:30am~ (my time) in the morning.

The payments have already gone through and am panicking because I can’t afford this. I’ve already sent a few emails but I don’t know what steps to take to get my money back in a timely manner. Edit: Bank said yesterday they can’t do anything on their side because I’ve made one purchase through them so that MUST mean all purchases are valid. Edit lmao: called again today and they said to start the process with them in a week if I can’t get Twitch to help. 

I’ve changed my password and deleted my payment information from the website to make sure this doesn’t happen again. Edit: and did 2-step verification.

Sorry if I’m breaking any rules or doing this wrong but I’m in panic-mode and have utilities due soon I can’t pay.

Thank you for any responses! 

EDIT: also if anyone has any idea how long I should wait before bringing it up to Twitch again, that would also be helpful. I’ve read about sometimes it taking up to 7 days for some people and others being ignored completely (of course I don’t know if these situations are actually valid) I want to be proactive but not nagging.

Edit: I’m impressed you made it to the end of this ridiculously convoluted wall of text! Everyone has been very nice and have given me some superb advice. Thanks to everyone who has been trying to help me out! Lessons learned: second-step verification, don’t use a debit card online if you can help it.

9h8j67,"As a streamer, your voice is your instrument. Learn to take care of it, and use it well!","This subreddit is filled to the brim with good nuggets of info about the technical and social aspects of streaming, but I feel like I never see much discussion about your most important asset in entertainment: your voice! With some very small exceptions, every successful streamer has their voice prominently featured in what they do. It's an instrument that we all use to entertain those who watch us. Let's make sure we're using them right, and keep them in top shape!

(As a bit of background, I'm a variety streamer that focuses on games I can do voices for. When I'm not streaming, I'm an amateur voice actor, host, and educator, which keeps my voice busy! I've taken lessons from 3 different voice coaches, of which I'm borrowing from heavily to make this post. I'm no expert, but hopefully this is a good starting point!)

Streaming is a harsh thing to do to a voice. Depending on the streamer, you're placing strain on your vocal chords for several hours a day, with little rest. For those not used to speaking a ton, this can be devastating to your overall sound! Here are some tips on how to keep your voice safe and strong before and during your stream.

**Before you stream:**

* Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Keep that water flowing! Keeping your system hydrated is going to keep your vocal folds in top, elastic shape, which helps them stay clean-sounding and resilient in your streaming barrage.

* Get some rest! Part of keeping your voice healthy is keeping you healthy. Get the sleep you need, and if you know you're going to be pushing it sometime soon, try to keep your voice quiet as much as possible beforehand. Take that pre-stream car karaoke down a notch, and save it for the mic! Same goes if you get sick, or your voice gets hoarse. No need to cause lasting damage for some short term gain.

* Think about what you're taking into your body! Smoking is obviously a big no if you want to keep those chords healthy. Secondhand smoke and other lung irritants can be harmful as well, so try to keep away from heavy-duty smoking sections/poorly-ventilated smokehouses/department store perfume samplers. What you eat and drink can affect your sound as well! Certain products like dairy and artificial sweeteners can cause a build-up of mucus, which tends to generate lots of ""mouth sounds"" (unintentional, usually wet-sounding noises easily caught by mics) that no one, save certain ASMR fans, wants to hear. Same goes for spicy foods and carbonated drinks, which can cause acid reflux and just generally awful feelings while speaking. Honey is a time-honored folk remedy that tends to help coat your throat and soothe any sore feeling. Mix it in some tea, and have a lovely tea time before stream!

* Warm up and stretch! One of the coaches I worked with has an [awesome set of stretches and workouts](https://www.voices.com/blog/tommy_griffiths_5-minute_workout_for_voice_actors/) that really prepares your face/mouth/voice for speaking. You'll look like an absolute lunatic performing these, but I promise that it really does help! Here's the gist of it:

&gt; For about 1 minute:
&gt;
&gt; Grin as hard has you can and hold it for a few seconds, then quickly purse your lips, and hold. Do this back and forth a few times then quickly stick your tongue out. Stretch it as far as it will go. Then touch the back of your upper teeth with the tip of your tongue. Hold for 5 seconds.
&gt; Say the word “wow.” Notice the positions of your mouth when you say the word? Your lips start out pursed and the word ends with your mouth open. Exaggerate the positions and repeat over and over as though you’re saying the word “wow.” By this point you should feel the facial muscles in and around your mouth.

**During the stream:**

* Keep hydrating! Don't let your throat dry out. Keep a large source of water at hand, and always be sipping whenever you can. 

* Don't overdo it! As fun as those super-saiyan screams are for each sub you get, don't commit to doing something that will cause long-term harm to your sound. Ration how often you scream, shout, use vocal fry, and whisper in each session. If you feel some strain, it's time to stop, and get back into a comfortable speaking range.

* Maintain good posture! I'm terrible at this one. A good posture ensures the best possible airflow, which can help your sound immensely. Sit back in your chair with your back straight and upright, and give your diaphragm enough space to expand. Don't try to hold in your stomach, as it limits that movement. Position your mic so that you don't have to slouch to be heard. 

* Technology can help! If you have everything set correctly, a normal, clear speaking volume and tone should be enough for you to be heard. Get a solid mic, place it somewhere that works best for your sound, and make it sensitive enough to get your full sound without bringing in the rest of the room. If you have to shout to be heard, it's time to fiddle with the settings.

Just like using an instrument, you're only going to get better with practice! Engaging in training outside of your stream will help you master your voice, giving you greater control over your sound. Here are some things that have helped me over my voice career:

* Read aloud! Whether you like to read books, articles, tweets, or Reddit, saying the stuff out loud can help work with your pacing and range. If it's a quote for someone, give it a different voice! Play around with your voice as you do. You might be surprised by what you discover about yourself!

* Strengthen your speech! Strong articulation can make or break your way of speaking. That coach from before has an exercise for this:

&gt; For about 2 minutes:

&gt; First, find some piece of copy and an obstruction for your mouth. Ideally, something about the size of a wine cork. Sit up straight or stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
&gt; Place the obstruction between your front teeth and read the copy out loud as clearly as possible. The obstruction will force your muscles to overcompensate for the difficulty in articulating the words. Keep reading for about two minutes.
&gt; Then take the obstruction out of your mouth and read the same piece of copy. You’ll notice that you now effortlessly pronounce the words.

He also has a suggestion for dealing with plosives, AKA sounds you make while speaking that involves a lot of air, like your P's:

&gt; For about 2 minutes:

&gt; Hold the palm of your hand a few inches away from your mouth, about where you would typically place your mic. Then say, “Pam’s preppy pal Peter.” You’ll likely feel a rush of air with the P’s. That rush of air is what creates the popping sound through your mic.
&gt; With full vocalization, practice saying “Pam’s preppy pal Peter” until you no longer feel the rush of air.Practice this every day for about two minutes and soon it will become second nature to speak in a way that will have you plosive-free, even in your regular day to day conversations.

* Get a coach! I'm not kidding. Whether you think you've got the voice of an angel or that of a chainsaw attacking a duck, seeking professional help can improve every aspect of your voice. From the tone and projection to health and enunciation, you'd be amazed as to how much they can fix. You can find coaches locally in some places, but in the age of the internet, ""Skype"" sessions work just as well! Prices vary, but I've paid coaches anywhere from $30-100 per session, and took something away from every one of them. They're typically individuals that have been in the voice acting/voiceover business for years, and are excited to help!

9g4ngi,Do any of you have a viewer that isn't a troll yet somehow drives you insane?,"I feel like I'll come off as an asshole for all of this, but trust me you have to be there putting up with him nonstop for a year to fully understand

I have this guy who has somehow never broke a rule yet ruined streaming for me. He says the dumbest stuff, has the most annoying requests, and somehow has to turn every conversation into something about cars and parkour. I don't understand those types of people who always turn a conversation into their hobby despite no one being interested. ""Dude, did you see that sick R150 Chrome blah blah blah? Isn't that sick? What's your favourite model?"" no. I've told you how many times that I don't know anything about cars so please stop.

I've told him time and time again that I only turn song requests on for multiplayer games yet every single player one I play he has to at least say once in the chat ""sr?"". And then when I am playing a game with song request on, he keeps asking for me to turn the music up so loud that you can barely hear me or my friends. If he cares that much about music, he should go listen to it on his own. The songs he request are the EXACT same ones every time. And guess what's in the title most of the times? ""Best songs to drift to"". Sometimes he doesn't even request music, just the sounds of cars revving up. Speaking of drifting, he sure as hell lets everyone know about this. 80% of my streams he leaves with ""Okay gonna go drifting now, see ya""

A huge chunk of my viewers have left because they can't stand him either. I've been told by many that he ruins the stream for them. My friends have all been driven mad by him too and they aren't even the ones who have to read his messages nonstop. They've convinced me that he needs to be banned or something else needs to happen. I just don't know how to do this without seeming like the biggest prick around. I feel bad for him cause he clearly likes watching me, but I can't just let him torment me nonstop

What should I do? And yes, I have told him time and time again not to do most of these things but the problem is they aren't really rules to begin with

EDIT: Thought I would give some more fun examples. I used to watch a couple YouTube videos with him at the end of every stream but I've since stopped. Yet nearly every stream he still asks for me to watch a 10 minute video even though I don't do that anymore. He even made a playlist called ""Videos for Johnny"" that he posts a link to in the chat every time. The playlist is literally just full of racing and parkour

Yesterday he comes into the chat and says ""You guys see that new Jack Ryan show? The driving and parkour looks amazing. The stunts are done by some YouTubers I know of"" I never even noticed driving or parkour in the trailer.....

He says some weird sexual shit too. I'll go take a break and when I get back he'll say something like ""I bet you just had sex ;)""

EDIT 2: [Here's a clip of what inspired this post today.](https://clips.twitch.tv/ViscousBoredCakeStinkyCheese) My friend last night called out my viewer on all the bullshit he's done

EDIT 3: Should have mentioned that he was a mod lol. I was really dumb before when streaming where I would mod any regulars who never broke rules and would enforce them. I've thankfully learned from this. Also, the drift king supreme is now banned from my Twitch

EDIT 4: I can't reply to everything, but thank you all for the replies and help

EDIT 5: Thought of some more things he's done. He back seat games whenever there is a driving part in a game I play. He'll tell me how horrible I am at driving a certain way and that I need to do this thing that way. I've since made backseat gaming a rule because of him, though it should have always been a thing. Forza Horizon is one of my favourite games and yet I dreaded playing it this year because of all the bullshit he was gonna tell me about every single car I drove. I feel relieved now that he's banned

He would try to find me on Facebook and asked me to spell out my last name even though I told him I wouldn't

When my friends call him out, all he does is talk shit to them and doesn't listen to their criticism

Oh and here's some gold I should have mentioned in the original post. He has changed his picture twice on Discord to a different car and every time asked us for our opinions on it and acts like his profile picture is badass. First time it was ""Got them new Discord pic"" and the second it was ""Hey Crazy what do you think of my new profile picture?"". It's just a fucking car, what is he expecting me to say????

You know, reading all this really makes me feel crazy for not banning him sooner

EDIT 8: Probably the last edit. I sometimes mute the stream for a minute so my friends and I can talk about something private. Despite the fact I say every single time first ""Okay muting the stream for a minute"" he'll say in the chat ""Is something wrong? I'm pretty sure your audio is gone"" ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/9g4ngi/do_any_of_you_have_a_viewer_that_isnt_a_troll_yet/,1537043023.0,457,0.94,237,Twitch,CrazymadmanxX

I also run a discord, and get to talk to a lot of the viewers. Over the past 3 months, I have learned that a lot of people use twitch as a way to socialize with others that enjoy the games that they like as well. I've seen many different personalities, and I've had a few people that like to criticize some of the younger viewers for not playing at the same level. I can't help but feel the need to defend some of these individuals. Some have very rough home conditions, depression, live in poverty, and potentially multiple personality disorders.

9a7vwi,The state of Twitch.,"Is it just me or have more and more inappropriate warnings and bans been happening over the last few months? I am really reconsidering using Twitch to stream based on their behavior as of late. Tfues ban is 100% wrong, no two ways about it. Dr Disrespects warning for scratching his crotch, totally uncalled for. Twitch is becoming less and less of a place where you safely stream. Its not Twitch itself, its the community. More and more trolls pop up daily to mess with other streamers. Sure you can ban them in your channel, but this doesn't prevent them from going to another channel and doing the same thing. Its truly getting bad. More and more small streamers are having to deal with these issues as well.   


I think we need to take a stand. I think we need to make Twitch enforce some changes to protect the streamer.  


\#1. Chat bans should be channel wide, not just ban someone from your chat. When you ban someone they shouldn't even be able to SEE your channel anymore on Twitch. If they make a new account and come back to mess with you, Hardware ban them from the entire site.   


\#2. Accountability needs to be on the user causing the violation not the streamer. This directly relates to TFue's current ban. He did nothing wrong, he even banned the guys from his chat when they were talking shit. But because they were able to stay and watch, when he hosted / raided someone else those people transferred. This is also realted to #1 of course.   


\#3. Better administration of the site in general. Twitch does no moderation at all unless something is reported. I think the twitch staff needs to take a more active role in monitoring the smaller streamers and removing the people that are causing problems. As a small streamer you may not have a moderator available at all times, and the amount of people causing problems in chat is on the rise. A small streamer cant be expected to be able to try and game, entertain chat, and moderate their channel with the amount of toxicity that is running rampant in the Twitch community currently. For a new / small streamer its a lot to try and deal with and has made people quit streaming. There are discussions about it all the time, and something needs to be done.   


The major problem we are all having to deal with right now is the rising amount of toxicity on Twitch in general. Its become really bad. I have noticed it myself. When I started streaming people were way cooler and way nicer and you didn't have to worry so much about every user coming into your channel. How are you expected to grow as a new streamer when every 5 minutes you have to ban someone from your chat for saying something that could potentially get YOU banned. I am seriously to a point where I think moving to another steaming platform is the ""safer alternative"".  I hate that every day I have to worry about getting banned for someone else's actions.

99y16k,Emote slots for Partners dropping below the maximum level achieved ?,"Hello, until now, when you reach a certain level of subpoints, you unlocked the corresponding emotes slots according to the table in that page :
https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2348985

If you fell below that level, you would keep your slots, it's even still written in that page in the FAQ as the last question is :

Q. Will my emoticon slots ever be taken away?

    A. Partners are able to unlock emotes slots permanently when they surpass their active subscriber count requirement. Assuming no fraud, if they happen to drop their active subscriber count in the future, the emote slots are still theirs to do as they wish.

However, today, a partner I'm working with tried to replace an emote and... couldn't, the max slots dropped. So is this over ? Twitch decided to fall back on their decision to leave the max ever unlocked slots opened ?

There's something contradictory in the page I linked upper, there's a box with that text :

NOTE: If you have fallen under the Subscriber Count tier for the number of emoticons you have, then removing emoticons will not result in freeing a slot for a new emoticon to be uploaded.

Does anyone has any more infos about this please ?

99oc8n,It’s ok to give up on Streaming if it isn’t making you happy!,"I would love to stream, make it big, quit my job, and live in Twitch land for a long time. Seriously, something along those lines has always been a childhood dream, to get paid to play video games, that would be so cool. Fast forward to hundreds of hours of streaming, late nights with little sleep, a couple average viewers, and a bunch of people telling me how to run my stream. 

**I thought I was doing this for me, why am I not enjoying this, isn’t this what I wanted?**

I really thought about if that’s what I wanted, and I realized video games for me have always been an escape and a journey for me. Every time I get a new game I can’t wait to immerse into it, learn everything I can, and be the very best at it that I can be. *That is fun to me!*

**Streaming takes that away for me.**

I thought back to when I was a kid, and I really thought about what I loved to do with video games as a kid, and that’s when it hit me. I loved to make montages of sick plays. I was doing that back in the Halo 1 and Halo 2 days with a freaking VRC... I had no clue what money was or wasn’t at that age, and that’s when it hit me. 

**Live streaming isn’t what I truly want to do, and even though it is hard, I had to give it up.**

There is so much more that goes into this decision than I stated above, but I wanted you all to know that if you’re not happy, it’s ok to make a change. Think about the math also when it comes to streaming. Most games you won’t even get noticed if you’re not out there building connections and getting other streamers to come support you. No new fans randomly come by, and if they do they usually leave, or they follow for a day or two and they’re on to the next stream. It’s just a very forgiving model for low level streamers. 

**So if you’re going to stream, understand that you can’t do it for the money, you can’t do it for the fame, and you can’t expect to grow very fast.**

If you’re fine with that, and your goal is to play games for a couple people for a long time, then I say go for it! I hope you’re very successful in your journey!!!

Please feel free to send me your channel so I can come follow. I do plan on being apart of the community still because there are a lot of great streamers out there and people to meet! So, this isn’t like, “bye Felecia” it’s more like, “we did our best and it wasn’t what we expected it to be, and now I’m going to go sit in the stands”.

98wghf,Sitewide ad-free viewing removed from Twitch Prime,"Just received an E-Mail.

&gt; In the almost two years since we launched Twitch Prime, it’s been exciting to see so many members of the Twitch community take advantage of one of the best deals in gaming and use perks like monthly channel subscriptions to support streamers like you.
&gt; 
&gt; As we have continued to add value for your viewers with Twitch Prime, we have also re-evaluated some of the existing Twitch Prime benefits. As a result, universal ad-free viewing will no longer be part of Twitch Prime for new members, starting on September 14. Twitch Prime members with monthly subscriptions will keep ad-free viewing until October 15. Members who already have annual subscriptions, or who upgrade to annual subscriptions before September 14, will continue with ad-free viewing until their next renewal date.
&gt; 
&gt; All other Twitch Prime benefits, like monthly channel subs, monthly games and loot, chat badges are not changing, and Twitch viewers can still get ad-free viewing across all channels by subscribing to Twitch Turbo (read about Turbo right here).
&gt; 
&gt; As a Twitch creator, we know you get a lot of questions from your community when changes happen on Twitch. We want to equip you with as much information as we can about this change to Prime benefits.

98ulo5,"OBS Studio 22.0 released - Source grouping, big browser source optimizations, and more","https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/22.0.0

#General Changes

* **Major improvements to the browser source:**

 * Added hardware acceleration to the browser source on Windows for greatly improved performance, reduced resources, and allowing advanced rendering functionality such as WebGL. This reduces CPU usage, reduces RAM usage, and even reduces GPU usage. This option is enabled by default; it can be disabled in the advanced section of settings if needed if there are any unexpected issues.

 * Refactored the entire plugin and pruned approximately 13,000 lines of code (very satisfying for me in particular)

 * The browser source now has accurate frame synchronization on Windows

 * Fixed all memory leaks of the browser source

 * Added the ability to use web browsers as widgets (which isn't currently exposed much, but will allow a lot more custom functionality later)

* **Added source grouping, allowing the ability to group multiple sources together as a single transformable group:**

 * To add a group, you can either select a few sources and then right-click and choose ""Group Selected Items"", or you can create an empty group in the Add menu

 * You can seamlessly drag and drop items in and out of groups

 * You can ungroup a group without affecting the group in other scenes by right-clicking the group and choosing ""Ungroup""

 * Groups show their list of sources as a sub-list within the main scene list, which can be collapsed and hidden if desired

 * Groups can be referenced (shared) between multiple scenes like any other source

 * Groups can have their own effect filters applied to them

* **Added the ability to set a custom background color to items within the source list to color-code them for improved organization:**

 * To set the item's background color, right-click the source item within the source list, and go to ""Set Color""

 * You can use a preset selection of colors within the menu, you can choose a custom color, or you can reset it to default

* Added a ""Vertical Layout"" option to the mixer's right-click context menu to make the mixer display vertically rather than horizontally

* The multiview can now be configured to show up to 24 scenes at once in general settings if desired

* Added an option to audio settings to allow the user to change the audio meter type: ""Sample Peak"" and ""True Peak""

* Added secure streaming (RTMPS) support for services that support it, such as Facebook

* It is now possible to use more than one Intel QSV encoder at once

* It is now possible to use alt-cropping even on sources that are set to a bounding box transform. This fixes the issue where, for example, alt-cropping would not work after you pressed Ctrl-F on a source. Note that in that case, the rectangle's size will not change, but the contents will realign to the rectangle.

* Windowed projectors are now saved and loaded on shutdown/startup

* Audio sources within the mixer now always displayed alphabetically

* Significantly reduced GPU usage when the program is idle (I.E. when the program is not streaming or recording)

* Added a confirmation dialog when the user has not added video sources to any scenes, warning them that they are about to stream a blank screen. This ensures that new users do not inadvertently stream without at least first adding some sources.

* The program will now default to the NVIDIA GPU when on laptops that have both NVIDIA and Intel integrated adapters. This can still be overridden in the NVIDIA control panel if desired

#Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where videos recorded with certain formats would report that they were 1000 FPS in their metadata when they actually weren't (1f592d1)
* Fixed a bug where the active monitoring device wouldn't properly change when switching between profiles (#1258)
* Fixed a bug where pasting filters without a destination source selected would cause a crash (b0cd7fe)
* Fixed a bug where projectors would close whenever ""Always On Top"" was toggled (#1207)
* Fixed a bug where the recording option ""Generate file without space"" was not working with the replay buffer (#1276)
* Fixed a bug where certain size cursors would appear the incorrect size in Game/Window/Display captures on Windows (#1284)
* Fixed a bug where in-program hyperlinks would show up with a bad contrast (dark blue) even in dark themes (e1ab9a0)
* Fixed a bug where stream output would stop if a stinger transition had a very late transition point assigned to it (an invalid floating point calculation would be put in to the audio data, which would in turn cause the audio encoder to fail and stop encoding, and thus stream output to stop) (0bd2e23)
* Fixed a bug on macOS where VLC would not be found for the VLC source despite VLC being installed (ec366cf)
* Fixed a bug on macOS where audio monitoring devices would not show up correctly, and fixed a few minor issues with audio monitoring on macOS (#1318, #1345)
* Fixed a bug where Mixer's FTL service would cause a crash on macOS (#1374)
* Fixed a bug where the color property (when showing the properties of sources/filters) would not show the actual color the user had set it to (#1305)
* Fixed a bug where hotkey labels would not update when sources and transitions are renamed, and could cause the hotkey to not be saved correctly (#1310)
* Fixed a bug where creating a new profile with advanced output mode active would not enforce the service's settings (such as keyframe interval) (310c98e)
* Fixed a bug where hotkeys for start streaming and stop streaming would disappear when going in/out of studio mode (caceb62)

I’ve never been allergic to anything in my life, so I brushed off the symptoms (burning lips, sweating, raspy breathing). I just thought my apartment was hot. I was trying to make light of the situation and joke about it with my viewers (literally we were all like lololol hopefully Maple doesn’t die). 

Anyway. I started feeling worse, so I called the stream and realized I was actually very sick - completely covered in hives. I messaged my discord and told them what was up - ONE OF MY VIEWERS WAS AN EMT. He called me, calmed me down, and told me what to do and how to get help. Another one of my viewers (I already knew him personally) picked me up and drove me to get Benadryl. 

I just moved to a new city and don’t really know anyone, so the advice and help meant so much to me. It’s really great Twitch not only provides a fun community to hang with, but also in this case, friends to help me take care of myself when facing a serious medical problem.

981aff,Lifelong Impact,"I wasn't sure exactly where to post this.  I chose /r/twitch because the story's setting is on Twitch. If I should move it, please let me know.  I'm still a Reddit noob, so please go easy on me.  I hope you enjoy!


Story time!  

A few weekends ago, I ran into a guy I've known all through grade, middle, and high school.  Adam is his name. 

Let's rewind to those school years...  Adam and I were always friendly, had several of the same classes, but didn't hang out too much outside of school.  Once (maybe twice) in grade school I went to his house after school to play video games and be rambunctious little kids. We had a good time, but that was pretty much the extent of our outside-of-school interaction.  Relevant to this story is the fact that Adam was maybe a little odd as a young kid, really into monsters and all that which I think freaked some of the other kids out, but he always was super nice. I thought he was great even if others tended to keep their distance.  We weren't best friends by any stretch, but we always got along really well, and that was cool.  

After HS graduation, Adam and I didn't talk again until our ten-year high school reunion.  It was great seeing him there.  We caught up, had a great time talking and hanging out, but didn't really keep in touch thereafter.

Now, back to a few weekends ago when we ran into each other...  Happy to see a friendly face from my youth, we get to talking about life, both reminiscing and filling each other in on the past few years... the typicals of careers and relationships and all that.  I ask him if he's still a gamer.  He is!  Now starts the important conversations about what games we've been playing and how PC is still the best gaming platform (sorry, console gamers). I mentioned to him that I started streaming a few months back.  He was super encouraging and said he'd love to check out my stream.  I gave him my info.  He's has been watching my stream most times I'm online ever since and is super active in chat.  I don't get a ton of viewers, so it's a lot of fun to have him in chat.

Just the other day, I was streaming and Adam tells me that he's been talking up my stream to his friends and discord channels.  That same night I get 4 or 5 new followers, which is huge for a new streamer like me.  Most of his friends didn't just lurk either (which I'd be perfectly fine with), but they popped in, hung out, and chatted.  It was great.  We all seemed to hit it off right away.  It was cool to have that kind of opportunity to interact with people.

Now, in my experience, streaming has its ups and downs.  It can be really discouraging streaming to zero viewers for hours on end, but then you can have those good days where people actually watch, engage, and things are great.  This night was the latter thanks to Adam.

After a bit of chatting with the group, I told Adam how nice it was to catch up and how genuinely appreciative I was that he went out of his way to promote my stream to his friends.  His response caught me so incredibly off-guard...

He said, ""Trying to help!  You've always been great people, and yeah, it's great to catch up.  I still remember in grade school I tried to do a summer party thing, my mom and dad thinking it'd be cool to get [me] more friends.  You were one of the three [people] that showed up.""  I was so touched by Adam's recollection of something like that from almost 20 years ago.  I think I said *something* because I felt like I had to, but it probably didn't make much sense.  He went on, ""Point of that was I appreciated that, if I can pay it back now... I'm gladly going to.""  I almost cried.  I had no idea that I had made that kind of impact on him, even after so many years.

I wanted to tell you all this story not to promote my stream (the video of the conversation would have been easier than typing all this out and probably would have made more sense, but I didn't want to even give the impression that this was a stream promo disguised as a PSA).  I'm also not trying to ""humble brag"" about how great of a person I may or may not be.  You, the reader, and I will likely never meet, so what would be the point of that?  I share it because the whole thing really drove home the concept that people have been saying for years, but we as a society too often forget... What we say and how we treat others really does matter.  It's never been more clear to me.  Whether it's online or in person, we can make an impact in others' lives.  Sometimes it's as simple as showing up to a party. Sometimes it's a kind word of encouragement. We may not even realize it, but our words and our actions can build people up or tear them down.  I think it's a good reminder to us all.  Treat others with love and respect.  Especially to all the younger people out there, remember that what you do today may stick with someone forever.


TL;DR: Grade school classmate promoted my stream to his friends because I was nice to him back when he didn't have a ton of friends.  Treat others with love and respect.

96z2bj,Community sub gifting also gifts those annoying bots.,"Recently I gifted 5 subs via the new community gift subbing. And for those who don't know, it randomly gives out subs to viewers.

This, unfortunately includes bots - you know, those really annoying ones twitch hasn't yet removed?

Well, as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/Jurdoyt.jpg), I found this the hard way. Why is this a problem? Well, in bigger communities with many viewers, the bots are severely outnumbered by honest viewers. However, in smaller channels, such as affiliate channels (which is where I was, on a stream with ~10 viewers iirc), the chance is much greater of giving to a bot.

This is problematic in a way. Although I am still supporting the streamer, which is the partial intention, the community isn't able to get the most out of it. It takes the ""community"" out of community gift subbing.

Unfortunately I haven't tested blocking these bots and reattempting, due to that will be a costly trial and error simulation. I advise blocking these bots if you intend to use this gift method, in case blocking blacklists them from the random gifting pool. 

I wonder on your opinions, and if you've seen further issues?

I believe there should be a method to *exclude* certain users, especially blocked users, from obtaining a randomly gifted sub. I do not know if twitch has incorporated this, but I honestly hope it is resolved.

These bots are becoming more problematic, from being gross in the viewers feed, to more or less stealing subs not intended for them.

Thoughts and suggestions on the matter would be interesting. Thanks for the read.

For the note, for whatever reason, in Firefox the old interface still loads and I have zero problems. In every other browser I have (Chrome, Comodo Dragon, Opera, Internet Explorer, Chromium and more), the interface that loads is the new one and all videos stutter radically. 

I have turned off and on hardware acceleration in browser options which makes no difference. I've been told that there's no way to load the old interface by a signifcant variety of people and the people who tell me I can change it back give me directions that I can't follow because the options they want me to look at literally do not exist on my end. I hope this isn't true. Can I change it? Is there something else I can do? I don't understand how this is even possible. Are the Twitch devs monumentally incompetant beyond belief or something? This is truly cringe. 

For the note, if I have literally nothing running on my computer AT ALL besides my web browser, I still get insane stuttering and problems when watching stuff on Twitch. 1080 Ti, 32 GB RAM, high spec Core-i7. W T F? 

Oh also, on my laptop, the same thing is happening... the new Twitch interface loads and all streams stutter to the point of being unwatchable. This makes me think it's not some weird random thing specific to my PC. All videos drivers are updated on both machines. 

I guess for the time being, I'm stuck with Firefox for Twitch which is not my preferred browser. I'd prefer not to be forced into using the PC/Desktop app either. It's more convenient to use my preferred browsers.

Thank you for any assistance.

1. Crashes often. Very often.
2. If a past broadcast contained even a little bit of copywritten material, you can't watch ANY of that broadcast.
3. Navigating videos suck. Let's say there's a 5 hour video and you wanted to watch something specific 2 hours in - you'd be there for a long time fast forwarding your way to it.

Kodi on the Xbox resolves all these issues. Doesn't crash. You can watch videos regardless of copywritten material, albeit with the volume muted during the copywritten parts. You can navigate long videos easily and quickly. Back button actually works.

I’m not sure where to start but I’m reading through all the posts on here from people in similar positions and watching streams.

My biggest concern is that I’m a girl and I don’t want to be one of those women streamers who make it all about their boobs and less about the game or that I’ll get a lot more targeted feedback directed to how I look rather than how I play ( and I play well!) 

It’s not that I’m worried about my looks, it’s more that I’m worried I’m going to be hounded with mean comments. I’m wondering if I should bother with it if the experience is going to more stressful from that than just trying to come up with interesting content. 

Can anyone give me insight on what it’s like being a female streamer (that maybe even is a female streamer?)

923apb,Using twitch as a relief,"I've seen people be burnt out, struggling to make do as a streamer, struggling to grow, and wanting to quit as a streamer. All of the examples above are rightfully so, and I can understand it well when people experience those feelings of being unable to increase their views, having people talk in your chat, being unable to entertain viewers because of the numbers and inactivity, and many more. What I haven't really seen is the reason for why they enjoyed streaming.

I had severe depression the past 2 months, and I took a hiatus from streaming. It was a really tough time, and almost nothing helped me get out of it. I had no positive outlook when it came to streaming, talking, networking, and so forth. All I needed was time and support. 

There was a stream team that I joined in the past weeks. I can say that they have been such a strong force in my life and they're part of why I've been able to climb out. They've encouraged me to live on, fight, and reminded me why I chased my dreams. I was able to stream again the past few days, and I realized despite having 3 viewers, or 20 viewers, it was exactly what I wanted all this time.

Sure, it's hard to not get fixated on the numbers game, and I understood it because I had that problem. When I took the streaming hiatus from depression and everything around me change, I no longer felt streaming as some sort of burden, but a great stress relief. I finally felt unconcerned for whatever was to happen, and I knew I'd ultimately grow over time if I chose to keep doing what I could do. 

This is a small story of struggle and confrontation. Let streaming be an opportunity; not a mistake. If you want to grow, continue to be yourself, but have a different outlook and maybe it'll change you as it has change me.

Logitech have just released their G HUB Software in Early Access. I don't know which webcams are currently supported as of today, but the BRIO 4K is despite not being advertised as such. It must have been a late addition!

[I can confirm](https://twitter.com/justnvc/status/1021755059812675585) that providing you've created both a camera and video profile in G HUB, it will remember and apply those settings on system startup. For those using anything that isn't a C920, you'll know the pain of manually setting auto-focus and color temperature every time you go live following a system restart.

If you'd like to check if your webcam is supported you can download it for Windows and MAC here: [https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/microsite/ghub](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/microsite/ghub)

There's also a feedback box in the bottom right where you can probably request your webcam if it's relatively new and isn't already.

8zud8y,"This is for anyone that is having a hard time gaining viewers, or want to build a community. Streaming is not about you, it is 100% about what you contribute to other peoples' lives.","As the streamer, **you** are a Personality, Entertainer, Teacher, Theorist, Host, Shoutcaster, Creative, Pundit, and/or Adventurer, etc., and you have a job to do. Your audience is dependent on the quality of connection and content that they get from your platform. Why? Because people consume the things that they get something from. Think about it. Why do you consume the media (social, words, music, videos, audio) you choose and use the products that you choose to? Why do you play the games that you do? Because you get something out of it. You are end consumer, and businesses are looking for your time, attention, and/or dollars, and they will succeed when they do more things that people like and can use.


Streaming is no different. If you love Fortnite... great. But you are probably just playing it for yourself, enjoying a game while the camera is on, and cannot hope to get an audience from it. Now...if you try to **have fun** with Fortnite and make it interesting to watch, then you make it about the audience. You can replace Fortnite with any other venture, and the idea still stands. **Make it about the audience.**


Oh, why is Fortnite dominating the world in less than a year and [making more than $300 million dollars a month](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17390004/fortnite-battle-royale-money-made-revenue-300-million-april-2018)? Because it is giving people what they want and a reason to stay engaged with their game. 


Now START. Pick the descriptors (like those in the first sentence) that you want to be known for start doing the things that represent that by giving your content some real planning and thought with your audience (or potential audience) in mind. Your name is your reputation, your content, your brand, AND your resume. So make it GOOD! Everyday is a chance to add to that in a real way. When you shift your mindset, results should happen quicker. Do not be ok with sinking years into streaming with no results. Twitch is saturated by people doing the exact same thing. This is how you can be different. You have more control than you think.

I am asking because I have done a lot of research recently and there seem to be countless threads in which people are trying to manage the expectations of various eager, aspiring streamers in terms of revenue and ""celebrity"". I understand some of them are more than happy to dedicate their time playing games without much return of anything nevermind financial (I am), and I can certainly understand that some of them might have savings (I do , I have started doing it fulltime a week ago) but surely not everyone around.

Perhaps the partner admission criteria was lower in the past? Or their viewer numbers just dropped down tremendously after being made partner? I guess I am just a bit confused  as the new kid on the block by the vast majority of streamers that fit under that criteria.

8yqe46,"[Suggestion] - Allow Streamers To ""Hide"" Their Recent VoDs Temporarily.","Hi there!

This thought occurred to me after I was practicing some Pokemon Trading Card Game on stream for an upcoming Tournament, and the user I was going to play against started asking me what I was going to play, or if I had VoDs, etc.


While I don't mind showing another player my VoDs, or strats, I'd rather wait to do so after I've played them in a competitive setting, and the match is over, instead of giving them ""Replay"" videos, clips, etc. before the match that could be used against me.


Would it be difficult to allow streamers to temporarily hide their VoDs, instead of the basic 3 options of:

- Don't archive all-together

- Archive them, and be vulnerable in these situations

- Hide behind a Subscription Paywall (Which people can access still by subbing if they really wanted to)


I would just like a simple feature to turn off VoDs from public viewing, and turn them back on again when comfortable.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8yqe46/suggestion_allow_streamers_to_hide_their_recent/,1531539302.0,249,0.91,22,Twitch,OU7C4ST

8xs28e,It is ok to give up.,"I'm posting this from a throw away for obvious reasons mainly because I don't want to be known as ""That twitch guy who told people to give up"" because my normal reddit and twitch user name are the same.

But something I see on here is ""never give up"" or ""keep going"". Which is ok to say but to follow through with it, is another story.

I'm gonna use a friend of mine who had been streaming since 2013. So close to 5 years I don't know when exactly he started beyond 2013.

He never got more than 5 viewers unless I hosted him or he was streaming a new release. 

He wanted more, he kept going based on posts on here. His entitlement so to speak grew to the point where he was getting pissed at new streamers who in his mind should ""wait their turn"" to be at the top, get ahead of him. 

He followed all the advice on here, cam, always talking, panels filled out, social media, discord, ect. He never saw naturally above 5 viewers. 

It got to the point where it consumed him. He lost his job, dropped out of college because he thought he could make a living off twitch, he thought he could be part of that crowd.

Well here we are in 2018. He is now living with me trying to get his life back together. He is working a minimum wage fast food job because that's the only place that would hire him. He can't afford to go back to college or even a trade school. He would have been homeless had I not stepped in and offered him a place to stay. 

So people who are struggling for viewers, who think you can make it big. While there is that slim 1% chance of it happening. Don't let it consume you.

It is ok to give up. It is ok, to just stop. Don't let twitch take your life over, don't pile so much effort and passion into something that in the end most likely won't work out the way you want it to.

Please, for your mental sake, and personal sake, just give up if you feel like you are going no one. Sure 1 - 3 viewers seems to be like a milestone here but it isn't worth stopping your life for to focus on. 

This is probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion since this reddit seems to be the ""happy go lucky you can do it"" type where anything negative is frowned on but it has to be said. These people who say ""don't give up"" very likely have never streamed before or are the ones who are the few who succeed and can afford to stream to live.

Hell, I've been partnered for 3 years, make a decent wage off bits, subs and ads, but there is no way in hell I could afford to quit my real job, not yet at least. I don't even live in a state where CoL is high, in fact I think I'm in one of the lower ones I'd have to check that later on but still, even here where shit is ""cheap"", going full time and just dropping my real job wouldn't be financially feasible or responsible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8xs28e/it_is_ok_to_give_up/,1531248123.0,1671,0.95,210,Twitch,[deleted]
8xk47q,I'm About To Quit....,"Everytime I boot up my stream, I just get racist trolls.

I'm a black streamer, so I think you can guess some of the things they say. Just a bunch of racist kids trying to ruin my day. Every single time i press the stream button..

I try to be such a happy, smiling and positive streamer all the time. I just want to make people laugh.

A few of my stream regulars come, and thats nice. But it just sucks how I'm getting more trolls and racists by the day. If I was growing my viewer-numbers, it would be fine. But I'm still getting the same 5-10 viewers, and more/different racist trolls everyday. I get so excited when I see a new face, but then it turns out that they are just another troll.

I know that as Twitch streamers, we need to harden our shell. But I'm at my tipping point. People are ruining what I love to do. Its making me depressed.

Can anybody offer me some advice on how to defend my stream and chat? I know I need to appoint more active moderators. But is there any programs or tools I can use to make sure certain words/phrases aren't said in chat? Any chatbots? Is there a way to stop trolls from making accounts and spamming racial slurs at me?

I'm just so sick of it. I don't know why people are still racist. Why do people love to ruin other people's day?

Thanks for reading my little rant/cry for help lol.

UPDATE: (jesus christ i did not expect all of you to see this) THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR ADVICE, KIND WORDS AND SUPPORT :') I learned lots of new things. I didn't know we can make viewers verify email before they chat, and follower-only mode. Im also using blacklist words on nightbot and automod on Twitch.

8wu3r8,Got Doxxed/Harassed Last Stream and here's what happened...,"So I did an IRL on Thursday and about 10 mins into the stream I got a wave of racist (anti-African American) comments and follows from people with racist usernames. Me being the positive person I am, I decide to ignore it, ban who i needed to and keep streaming. More time passes and they posted my home address in chat and in my discord chat. Immediately I deleted it, hid the messages and turned off my on-screen chat and notifications. I set my chat to followers only (1 month for the time being to weed them out) and continued to stream and talk with my friends in the stream. All the while i guess the trolls are still going on.

About 10 mins later I get about 3 different pizza place deliveries to my front door. I let the drivers know, ""yea I'm a youtuber (cause most didnt know what Twitch was lol) and someones trying to prank me"" they were mostly understanding and were like ""oooh ok, well we'll let our managers know whats going on""

I notified my local law enforcement to let them know what was going on (in case they tried to SWAT afterwards) and they let me know ok we have it on record.

After another 30 mins or so i finished up my stream cause by that time only one or 2 people were still in chat and at that point I was just drained.

**The aftermath**

* The next morning I put in a large number of requests to public record sites to remove my information (most did within a few minutes) If you have a unique name, I highly recommend googling your name and seeing what pops up.
* Filed a formal report with my local police department, I also learned that I have some of the most chillest officers in my town and gave them my business card with my twitch info on there (one was even an anime fan too). So they are aware that I am a streamer.
* I shut down all open, instant invites to my Discord Channel (weeded out the trolls as well) and made it into an invite/sub/patron only server.
* Reported the spam accounts to Twitch (still no word on that as they are still active as of today)
* I WILL still stream despite all of this

Has anything like this happened to you as a streamer? Do you think I handled the situation ok? Were there things you would've done differently? Let me know in the comments below.

**Update:**

* The Spam accounts were removed from Twitch (thanks for that),
* My info has been removed from a vast majority of the public record sites and google searches.
* This article has helped immensely: [https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/what-is-doxxing-how-to-avoid/](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/what-is-doxxing-how-to-avoid/)

8wkswk,Is it frowned upon/rude to try and game with streamers (I’m looking for talkative gamers)?,"Hi Everyone!

I've been a long time lurker on Reddit and Twitch, so I apologize if this post is in the incorrect thread. I started playing CS Source, Day of Defeat, Guild Wars, WoW etc. in middle school and fell in love with gaming ever since. I am now a quarter of a century old and the friends I grew up playing games with have either quit or play even less than I do. 

Basically, I was wondering if it is considered rude to try and specifically play with people who are currently streaming/stream regularly. My thought behind this is that people who stream generally have to be outgoing and willing to chat with others. My past experience when talking with people in games like WoW and GTA V is that everyone wants to just complete the objective/dungeon and move on to the next group. I think it would be a lot of fun to schedule a time to play with someone who is willing to just chill and game for an hour or two!

For clarification, I am not asking to only play with someone who will stream us playing, I am just looking for some like-minded talkative gamers. If you do happen to stream the session, that is totally cool with me! A lot of the ""Beginner Stream"" articles say you should have someone to chat on comms with to practice always talking, so I figured I might be able to help some people out! :D

I can normally play weeknights around 8pm - 10pm MST. My weekends are usually pretty open. I do not stream, but it is something that I think would be fun since I enjoy the social aspect of gaming. If one of y'all end up inviting me for some games, expect to be asked a few questions about streaming and what you enjoy or loathe about the process!  

Please hit me up with any suggestions and if you would like to play!
(First Reddit Post Complete!!!)

Edit: Wow! This really blew up. I am at work so I cannot reply to every comment directly, but I will make sure to reply while I’m at lunch or after work.

I think the general consensus is that it’s alright to ask and play with streamers as long as you approach it properly. If you leave a comment with your channel/said you want to play some games I will definitely be hitting you up! 

Thanks for your input everyone and keep it coming! 

Edit #2: I’ve spent a good chunk of my day trying to reply to every comment that this community has been kind enough to leave. I’ve got to get to bed now, but I just wanted to extend a big thank you to anyone who took the time to leave some advice/suggestions. I will slowly be going through this list and contacting people who were interested in gaming! GL to everyone in their games/streams!

8vjn8g,Don't be scared to dispute copyright claims (on YouTube) and what you should know before you do,"When you get a copyright claim on YouTube they make it a pretty scary experience. To file a dispute you have to check a box (in BOLD letters) saying, ""I understand that filing fraudulent disputes may result in a termination of my YouTube account.""

I've found that sometimes a lot of people are too scared to continue. If you are truly using free music (see the rest of the post) then you SHOULD DEFINITELY file a dispute. Don't let a false copyright claim steal your money. I hope the rest of the post can help you understood a little vocabulary so you have the confidence to dispute claims. Or, to know when not to if you used a song you weren't supposed to.

The best foolproof way is to get written permission from the artist to use the song, however, it wouldn't be feasible to ask most artists to answer the thousands of emails from YouTubers asking to use their song. To avoid these mass emails, many artists release music under a license called ""Creative Commons.""

Many CC licenses allow you to use songs commercially, which means you can monetize them. And it means if you get a copyright claim on a song that is Creative Commons you SHOULD dispute it. Here is how I responded to a copyright claim and an example of what a rock solid copyright claim dispute could look like...

EXAMPLE of a dispute: ""This song is licensed under the ""CC-BY"" license and was released under this license by the artist MI77ER here: [http://soundcloud.com/mi77ermusic/dreaming-for-love-creative-commons](http://soundcloud.com/mi77ermusic/dreaming-for-love-creative-commons) According to the license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) ""the licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms."" Please see our video description for indication that we have followed the license terms (proper attribution). It is clear that this license was granted by the artist himself and is not a counterfeit account. Please revoke your copyright claim.""

When I submitted this copyright dispute I was darn sure I would win because I knew three things. I knew what license the song was released under, I had the original source showing that license, and I had followed the rules by giving attribution in the video description (probably the most important part). A couple days later I got an email saying the claim had been revoked.

**VOCAB Time!**

The following bullets are different parts of a Creative Commons license. They can build or stack like legos. For example, you could see a song with the license of ""CC-BY-SA-NC"". Each part was stacked on top of the other part.

* CC – stands for Creative Commons
* NC – Non-Commercial (if the CC license has NC in it, don't use it on YouTube!!)
* ND – No Derivatives (If the CC license has ND in it, don't use it!! Making a video with this song in it would be considered a derivative)
* SA – Share-Alike (This license is good to go for monetizing on YouTube, it just means you can't share this song on your own website under a different license)
* BY – Attribution (This license is good to go for monetizing, IF you give attribution to the artist)

TLDR: ""**CC-BY**"" and ""**CC-BY-SA**"" are good to go!

Avoid anything with ""NC"" or ""ND"" in it.

**How to give a good attribution:**

CC-BY and CC-BY-SA both ask for attribution. That means as long as you link back to the original source and give credit to the artist then you can use it commercially. A good formula for this (I got this from the Creative Commons website) is called **TASL.**

**T -** title of the song

**A -** artist who wrote the song

**S -** source of the song

**L -** license (put cc-by or cc-by-sa here)

Honestly, a simple link back to the artist would be sufficient in most cases, I'm just suggesting best practices and bulletproof guidelines for confidence against copyright claims.

**Where to find CC-BY and CC-BY-SA songs:**

Soundcloud:

I love soundcloud because you can look at the bottom of the description to see if it has a creative commons license. For example, this random song on soundcloud shows the cc-by license right at the bottom. Hover your mouse over the ""Creative Commons License"" part and it will show you the specifics.

Use this link to practice finding which license is used: [https://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-6-in-b-minor-op-2f](https://soundcloud.com/stevenobrien/prelude-no-6-in-b-minor-op-2f).

Unfortunately Soundcloud isn't immune to fraudulent licenses. Artists can say that a song was licensed as cc-by on Soundcloud and then go after people on YouTube. Or they will make remixes that they don't have the right to claim is cc-by because they used copyrighted material in the remix. I avoid using remixes in my YouTube videos like the plague. 

YouTube channels:

\*Note, there a lot of music channels on YT I don't trust because they don't follow attribution rules (they link back to themselves rather than linking to the original source of the music). Just make sure you can see a source and a license on their YT description!

 Other than my main YouTube channel I have one on the side called Music Library where I test songs from Soundcloud to make sure they are truly CC-BY or CC-BY-SA. If it doesn't pass my tests then I take it down immediately. So far I've been able to clear \~600 songs. I'm always very clear about where the song came from (rather than claiming my channel as the ""source""). In addition, I always list which license the song is under so you can be sure it is safe to use.

Here are some of the playlists I think would be most useful to the twitch community:

EDM - [https://youtu.be/l2GhLXlPbVk?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQRbEW1m0k-2X\_uvp\_sgdqHn&amp;t=13](https://youtu.be/l2GhLXlPbVk?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQRbEW1m0k-2X_uvp_sgdqHn&amp;t=13)

As I said before, there are TONS of places you can find free music. Just make sure you know what license it is under and you give attribution in your YouTube description. If you've done those things, then you can have the confidence to fight hard against third party groups that try to steal money from YouTubers. I'm not joking, some untrustworthy publishers use it as way to make money. They release a song as CC-BY, then send an auto copyright claim to YouTubers that don't know any better and get the revenue from their work. Don't let that happen to you! (assuming you aren't using music you know you shouldn't be)

Last note, someone is probably going to mention in the comments that creative commons licenses can be revoked or that a publisher can remove his song from creative commons at any time. This is copy and pasted from [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/)

""The CC licenses are irrevocable. This means that once you receive material under a CC license, you will always have the right to use it under those license terms, even if the licensor changes his or her mind and stops distributing under the CC license terms.

8ujndl,Playing with followers,"What’s up guys! I just recently started streaming and hit 25 followers today! That being said i came across a scenario that was pretty new to me and i decided I’d come on here and share it. So I’m in the military, and the little free time i have i usually spend it playing squads with my buddies whenever we have an opportunity to, and we usually end up with a 3-man. Frequently on chat people spam and ask if they can play. I finally gave in and let a random join, and he proceeded to talk about how happy he was, and that people usually ignore him. We played a few games with him and he told us about how he was bullied and we really gave him a place to go and hangout, and that felt pretty good. The kid was 12-13 ish and just looking for someone to play video games with. Completely opened up my eyes to some of the scenarios that some of these people asking to play may be in, and I’ve tried more now to invite them. I set something up on weekends (kind of how stonemountain does) to play with followers. We as streamers really do have a tremendous opportunity to give people an escape from some of their harsh realities, and even though I’m playing games that i have fun with, its even better now knowing that I’m helping them have fun too. I know i don’t have a big channel, but our ability to impact people at low levels of exposure is an awesome opportunity, and i cant wait to see what i can do in the future. Thanks for reading!

8s5zo1,Let's chat about /raid,"Hey streamers, since my last reddit thread we've seen /raid usage grow. We've also seen that raids are about twice as effective as hosts in getting your viewers to continue watching the other channel. With this in mind, we are planning to make several improvements to raids and would love your feedback on the following:

**Custom raid countdown timer**

We've heard that you want more control over when a raid triggers instead of always after 30 seconds. Here are a few options we're considering:

1. Shorten the raid timer to 5-10 seconds.
2. When a streamer types /raid, they see a \[Start Raid\] button in the prompt. The streamer can click this button to trigger the raid manually. We can even remove the 30s timer entirely and just let the streamer trigger the raid in two steps.
3. A streamer can set a custom timer via a chat command e.g. ""/raid channel 15s""

1) and 3) are easier to do but I think 2) gives streamers the most flexibility. Thoughts?

**Raid recommendations**

We are planning to offer suggestions for channels to raid when you type /raid. To help us with these channel suggestions, we'd love to learn more about what types of channels you want to raid. I can think of a few types:

1. Channel you're following
2. Channel playing the same game
3. Channel that you've raided recently
4. Channel that raided you recently
5. Other?

Also do you typically check out the channel's stream before deciding to raid or host that channel?

**Making raids more fun and exciting**

It's already an exciting moment when one community is introduced to another from a raid. How can we make this experience more fun for everyone involved?

8reac3,Try out other twitch streamers!,"As the title says. I've been noticing more and more lately that a lot of people who used to be big streamers are getting lower and lower view counts as the days go by and Fortnite streamers like Myth, Ninja, and Daequan are getting an incredible amount of viewers. Especially Ninja, who seems to rake in at least 100k+ people per stream. 

I'm not against these guys getting viewers at all, their good streamers and people want to watch them, I actually really like it. Any attention that gets attracted to Esports and twitch streaming are a good thing, in my opinion, and the Fortnite craze has been nothing but fun to watch with all these streamers becoming more household names and watching competitive tournaments and new game modes unfold makes for awesome and fun content as well. I just wish that more of the newer twitch viewers that came because of Fortnite, or just happened to try watching twitch recently for other games, would try out watching other streamers. Fortnite is fun to watch and I love watching Ninja myself, I've been watching Ninja since about 2015 because of H1, but there are so many streamers to enjoy when you're not feeling the top streamers. 

Just try checking out a random streamer sometime.

8qqwx0,How to change the volume of music for your viewers and not yourself - and many other things.,"Hello!  
First off, sorry if this pops up in your feed, I'm really not worried about the votes I just want to get this out there for the search engine folks.  This may seem like a wall of text, but it's actually not that bad.
  
That being said, I ended up installing 3 different programs, and it was crazy difficult to figure out (I'm fairly tech-literate as well.)  
  
Here's to hoping this helps someone, I had a very simple goal in mind (my viewers JAMMING while I just hear it as background music - as I'm more concerned with the ingame sounds (You can also turn up game sounds for you and not your viewer.  Honestly, this setup opens a TON of options for streaming/projectors/speakers.  We have a stream room with projector here, and now I'm able to route a google chrome hulu window - on the projector - JUST to the speakers in the room - where it's out of my mic pickup.  
That's right - I'm able to use my third monitor (a projector hanging from the ceiling) to project hulu for the whole room without my viewers hearing a thing.  This also works if you want to watch shows or listen to music that you don't want on your stream audio!  
  
One more final note before I get started, I'm **absolutely not sure** this is the easiest/best way to do this, but it works!  
  
---  
  
Programs required - (Not sure if links allowed, easily google-able)  
- Audio Router (unless windows 10)  
- Voicemeeter Banana  
- VB-Audio Virtual Cable  
  
After you've downloaded everything and restarted the few times it requires, you're ready to begin.    

**Step 1** - in ""Sound"" options for windows - Select ""Voicemeeter Input"" for ""Playback"" - Right click and - Set as active and default devices.    

**Step 2** - Open ""Audio Router"" - Find your music. I use Spotify Premium Desktop (play a song if it doesn't show up) - Click the arrow - route - ""CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)""   
  
**Step 3** - Open ""Voicemeeter Banana"" - while it looks confusing it's actually pretty simple.  The first 3 columns are physical inputs  The next column contains both virtual sources but we just need 1.  The final column is your hardware out and volume mixer.      

Now you will click the headings to select devices.  
Set - the first column - as your microphone.  
Set - the second column - as ""CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)""  
Skip - the third column, don't need it!  
Skip - the fourth column, these are automatic  
Move to the final column, select your headphones as the hardware output.    
  
Now, open OBS and click the settings cog next to ""Desktop Audio"" - select ""CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)""  - this is spotify - so adjust the volume you want your viewers to hear spotify at.
Click the cog next to Mic/Aux and select ""Voicemeeter Output - VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO"" as the source (psst, this is ""B1"" on voicemeeter!) - this is any audio you route to ""B1"" in Banana as WELL as any desktop audio (since VAIO is the source we picked earlier in our sound settings as our default device.)
  
Head back over to Voicemeeter Banana, now we must tell our audio which channels to go to.    
You can right click to rename the columns if you want

""Column 1"" is your mic
""Column 2"" is spotify - but remember we already added spotify to stream, so this is just for your headphones/speakers/whatever you want.
""Column 3"" is a spare I don't personally need, you can add another source!          

Now, by selecting the different buttons, you can tell the sounds where to go:  
""A1"" is your headset
""B1"" is what your stream hears - the VAIO 
      
Now, in the last large column you're able to define what sources your headphones hear (the 5 sliders are A1-3 and B1-2) and how loud.  You can also change other audio things here that I won't even pretend to understand, but I'm sure you can make things sound nicer.

[Here's an image of my ""Voicemeeter Banana"" setup all said and done.](https://i.imgur.com/kxzr6tx.png)   
The result of my setup is that my viewers will hear spotify at full volume, while using the mixer I'm able to set it to be very quit for myself - or also jam if I want.  
  
I apologize that this is so difficult to read, but trust me, the alternative of trying to figure it out yourself isn't a good time.  I really hope this helps at least one person who was frustrated like I was, and I'll be happy.

You can [**download it**](https://nerdordie.com/product/free-minimal-alert-maker/) from here (requires Email for download link) or check out the [**video guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amkW-GGpZdc) for more information. Currently, this only works with Streamlabs, but supports pretty much every streaming software that can use a browser source. Also, if you're multi-streaming, it has support for all other platforms for that Streamlabs supports.

&amp;nbsp;

I did my best to add as many things as I could think of, but definitely am open to any new feature requests that you'd like to see added in the future. With our other [**free resources**](https://nerdordie.com/product-tag/free-resource/) and [**stream graphic makers**](https://nerdordie.com/product-category/graphic-makers/) you should be able to make a custom designed stream with little effort! Thanks!

8o5twh,Streamer with a rare eye condition sad that twitch now forces the new dashboard,"So I was using the legacy twitch dashboard up until maybe a week ago. There was a url that would force the old one. Not only did I find it aesthetically more pleasing, but I was able to zoom in a couple of times on my browser and the chat was the perfect size for me to clearly read it on my second monitor without assistance.

With the new dashboard forced the chat takes up maybe half, if that, the size it used to. Unless there's some way to stretch the chat across two tiles, which would be nice. But I'm a tad less responsive to my chat, which kinda sucks since I was hyped for the reduced stream delay making interacting so seamless.

I have keratoconus, which is a degradation of the shape of the cornea. My case is fairly mild, so I don't wear hard contacts for it which you normally would. But I also don't wear glasses at my PC because I originally only wore them for long distance vision and my glasses are mainly still geared towards that. But I have problems with contrast vision, things are little less clear (Especially since my 2nd monitor is on the side of the eye that has the condition presenting far more), and I can get ghost images underneath stuff. So having a wider chat that takes up more real estate on the screen is a lot easier on me.

I'm kind of hoping that someone at twitch with their ear to the ground can maybe just let me use the old tech again, or maybe even take my idea to stretch the chat across another tile. But that's probably a long shot at this point, and I'd be glad to hear any potential solutions that keep the ease and convenience of the dashboard format intact while providing better visual clarity for myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8o5twh/streamer_with_a_rare_eye_condition_sad_that/,1527995688.0,437,0.93,53,Twitch,Shadostruct

8nms07,"Yesterday I stumbled upon Twitch's dark underbelly, and I was horrified by what I saw...","I'm a super small streamer, who started streaming last October. Yesterday, after ending my stream, I was curious to see who was still in my chat, as I usually have a few lurkers and bots. Besides good ol' electricskateboard there were 2 other users lurking there. One seemed like a normal viewer with a normal twitch profile, but the other was something else entirely...

The user was actually streaming, and had around 200 views. The stream was a just a big leaderboard, styled like a computer terminal. On the leaderboard were usernames and numbers. I didn't really understand it until I opened the chat. What I saw can only be described as the saddest and most disturbing thing I've ever seen on twitch.

It was a fairly fast moving chat of users begging for follows, with statements such as ""follow for follow pls"" or ""please follow me!!!!"".  I decided to ask the chat, ""lol wtf is this?"" The only response: ""hey supplememe, please follow me back!!"" And so the chat churned on, hundreds of streamers begging for meaningless follows.

This horrified me. It reminded me of the soullessness of social media like Instagram, where random users would regularly follow me, like the most recent picture I posted, and then a week later unfollow me. A meaningless gesture just to grab my valuable attention. Every user in that chat was seeking empty gratification, chasing numbers and not actual relationships.

I thought of that guy who recently posted the video about how twitch streaming ruined his life, and left him alone and friendless, how he never ""made it"", despite 3 years of streaming. How desperation causes people to pick and claw at empty handouts, just so one day they can lay back, look at their 0 average views and 10,000 followers and whisper the empty hollow words, ""Ahhh, I made it"". Sound absurd? Because it is.

Fuck numbers. Follows and views all the same. Think of your followers and viewers as numbers, and you'll never ""make it"". The only number goal I set for 2018 was to reach 50 followers, simply because it's a stepping stone to affiliate. I don't plan to beg my way to that goal, since the victory would be shallow and meaningless. I want followers who want to watch me, not ones who want to use me. 

It's not about numbers, it's about having a good time. Since day 1 I've always enjoyed streaming, even the days when nobody is watching. It would be a waste of time otherwise. I'm thankful for the few viewers and regulars I do get. They are so much more than just numbers. I hope I never lose sight of that and end up as a 'follow for follow' zombie in a twitch graveyard.

Happy streaming!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8nms07/yesterday_i_stumbled_upon_twitchs_dark_underbelly/,1527806508.0,110,0.77,67,Twitch,Supple_Meme

8mq6kr,"I developed a free, open source, Twitch streaming tool to help you never miss another stream event. SimpleAlerts is here to help you organize your stream alerts with meaningful filters and groupings that makes sense for your streaming style! Entirely built on stream and ready for you to try today!","### Introduction
Hi everyone!
First off, thanks so much for checking out this post. I am super excited to tell you about something I made. My name is Alec and I am an avid programmer who streams programming weekly on Twitch. I build software applications from start to launch within 28 days. I have a passion to share what I know about software development and encourage others to get invovled and show them that with an idea and passion, you could build anything. 

Try SimpleAlerts Now @ https://www.simplealerts.stream

I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I hope this post will explain it all to you.

### What is SimpleAlerts?
SimpleAlerts is an open source, streaming tool that helps organize your Streamlabs events by using meaningful filters and groupings. As streamers, we ALL know how important it is to be active with our community and give shoutouts almost immediately. As you start receiving more and more alerts it gets harder to keep up with the onslaught of these shoutouts. That's where SimpleAlerts comes in.

This free, open source tool built on top of Streamlabs' system (huge shoutout to them for great API docs \m/) helps you by doing multiple things:

- Organize certain events into certain sections
- Give priority to events that need immediate attention
- Show which events have been read already and which have not

**NOTE: SimpleAlerts currently only supports Twitch login and has only been tested on Google Chrome web browser. As this application is currently in beta, I would appreciate any and all bugs/feedback reported [here](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts/issues)! This will help keep SimpleAlerts going!**

### Organize Your Events
On Twitch we receive many different events- follows, subscriptions, cheers, donations, hosts, and raids. Currently, SimpleAlerts supports the following events: follows, subscriptions, cheers, and donations. The current event list shown by Streamlabs shows every event within a single section as well as events you may not care to receive. While this is definitely helpful, I believe there is a much more intuitive way of doing this. By selecting which events you want shown (or not shown) in each section, SimpleAlerts helps you organize what you are looking at and keeps your most important events at the forefront of your stream. Take a look at the demo [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/e7OTRjKY94fbu7kigj/giphy.gif) to see this type of sectioning in action!

### Prioritize Events
This was a pinnacle feature I wanted SimpleAlerts built upon. This idea really came to life by watching large streamers constantly lose track of their event list. If you have ever watched Dr. Disrespect, you have definitely heard him say how he can't keep up or loses his place during shout outs. This is why this feature is so important. Each event has a set of filters that you are able to apply to each section that will highlight incredible events during your streaming session. 

For example, let's say you have your cheer event setup and you want to know when someone cheers over 1000 bits? Easily set that by entering it into the ""Bump By Bits"" option, and when you receive a cheer that is 1000 bits or more, your event will automatically be pushed to the top of the list AND highlighted yellow! Now let's say you received that cheer event, but something else happened and you have not shouted that person out yet. Every event list has an option to set the ""Bump By Time"". This means you can automatically bump events that have been waiting for x amount of minutes to the top of your list! At the moment of writing this post, Streamlabs does not hav any sort of feature like this. Take a look at the demo [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3fde6nns1zw7q38/BitBump.mov?dl=0) to see it in action!

### Know Who You Shout Out
Everything about events goes back to the viewers. These are the people that support you and keep you motivated to stream. Being able to keep track of who you have or have not shouted out is key. SimpleAlerts helps you do this with ease. As soon as you are done shouting someone out, just click the event cell and it will automatically go to the bottom of the list, turn green, and add an option to completely remove it from your section's list. This feature gives you multiple ways to organize your events in the way that is the best for your streaming style. Again, at the time of writing this post, Streamlabs does not offer anything like this. Take a look [here](https://media.giphy.com/media/3KXbhJTiHhvIJS4uka/giphy.gif) to see a demo of this feature! 

### Open Source &amp; Contributing
You read it right! SimpleAlerts is a 100% free and a fully open source platform. This means that anyone is able to get access to the code, contribute features or even make their own apps based off of the logc in SimpleAlerts. The reason I started streaming was to show others my process for building applications and hopefully inspire people to get invovled in programming and streaming it on Twitch. This project is able to help you get your feet wet with web development and contributing to an open source project! I want to see others succeed and I hope this project can do just that.
To get started contributing to SimpleAlerts, head over to the [Github Repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) to find out exactly how you can get invovled!

### Final Thoughts
While these were only some of the awesome features behind SimpleAlerts, there are many more smaller pieces that bring the user experience of this app together. I have been so excited to share this with everyone here and I do hope that you find this tool helpful during your streaming career. Again, SimpleAlerts is still growing and is looking for constructive feedback from the people that use it! Please feel to submit any sort of feedback or issues at anytime.

8knekx,"[Question] As a streamer, Am I allowed to played with followers who are minors?","Hey everyone,

I'm having trouble finding the answer since most of what comes up when I google or search the subreddit is pertaining to Parents having their kids on stream. My question is, When I am streaming, is it ok for me to stream and squad up in Fortnite (or any game) with my younger followers? I don't know their age, but they are clearly kids when they talk through their mics. I just want to make sure I am not breaking any ToS and if so, I will kindly let tell them I cannot play or will have to mute them during stream.

Thanks all and happy streaming!

EDIT:
Thanks for the responses everyone! The group of kids that found me are a good bunch of kids and are very respectful towards me and the stream. I was just worried because I watched another friend of mines stream and he stated that he did not want to play with anyone underage and get banned by Twitch, which made me wonder if that was true or not and if I needed to take action.

8k7wxf,I've created and organized samples for just about every combination of encoding settings you would ever want.,"Edit: As someone below pointed out, Twitch compresses all video uploads and doesn't allow source quality, so I have reuploaded all the videos to dropbox for now and the videos should stream directly in your browser at the source quality. Because it's on dropbox, there is a daily transfer limit, so if it breaks, just wait and try again the next day. I will try to figure out a better solution for this, but most places seem to transcode videos automatically.

Slight clickbait title aside, don't let this be the only thing you look at, but rather look at it as a guide to lead you to where you are going. I did not include many bitrate increments, as I found most people will stream either around 3000-4000kbps or at 6000kbps, so for the sake of my time I went with 3500 and 6000 as they are so common. It is by no means comprehensive, but rather serves as a general real world look into how your encoding settings affect your stream quality. 


I also did NOT extensively check every video, so if there is one that is messed up, please let me know so I can re-record it and re-upload it. I spot checked them, but I wasn't going to watch every single one through.


What I've done here is used OBS Studio to record the same scene using common settings at 2 different bitrates. I have 720p and 1080p at 30fps and 60fps, all at 6000kbps and 3500kbps bitrates, using encoding presets from Ultrafast down to Medium, and also using NVENC. I figured this would be helpful in figuring out what you would expect from different combinations of settings, including high motion and high foliage scenes. I did leave out 900p, but you can imagine it will look somewhere between the 720p and 1080p versions. 



The scenes range from slow movement to fast movement over foliage, and also includes rain effects, which is where encoders generally struggle and basically the worst case scenario for streaming. 



I've linked all the individual videos through the 2 tables at the bottom for quick looks at specific combinations

I am probably one of the smallest streamers on this sub, I have 18 followers and usually no viewers.

One day I was streaming Escape From Tarkov, a viewer in chat started talking to me so I was having a conversation with them. I’m getting ready to load up into my next raid and I see the viewer in the lobby (user name was the same as twitch and pretty unique). I don’t think I encountered the viewer however.

I know stream sniping is an issue for big streams but I was actually amused that someone tried to stream snipe me.

8jp72q,the 12 People You'll Have in Your Stream (sooner or later),"As a streamer and viewer, I've always liked interacting with a channel's chat. Back in the day, I used to hang out in AOL chatrooms and talk with random people for hours. I've noticed over the years watching Twitch that some people fall into certain ""characters"" in the chat. Here are the ones that come up the most:

*E D I T: Added more, now up to 21 types of people!*

* **The Conversationalist.** Even with lulls in gameplay, they're still chatting it up with the streamer and viewers to keep the stream active and engaging. It's less about the game and more about the interaction. This is even more helpful when the streamer is really focused on the game but also wants the chat to keep going without  having to always be talking.

* **The Hype (Wo)Man.** They do all the extra work for you so you can focus on streaming. The ones who spam emotes when someone subs or give an extra thanks for a new viewer's follow. This is someone who genuinely enjoys your content and wants to get the word out for others. They'll host you, clip highlights, re-tweet your tweets, and more. They make each person feel more welcomed and valued than the streamer already shows. Such a small thing that really goes a long way to building a community.

* **The Assistant Moderator.** They aren't a mod, but that doesn't stop them from monitoring the chat. They call out trolls, remind newcomers of the rules, and even assist with commands. It's especially great when they are on the same thought process as you: you don't have to say anything, they already know what you are about to say and do.

* **The Coach.** These viewers want to see you succeed. They give you constructive criticism when others don't. You don't know how many times when there was a technical issue for hours and finally when they stepped in they said ""hey, your mic audio is really low."" or ""You might want to change the game directory, you're still streaming in IRL"" WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME THIS BEFORE? And they will also tell you things straight up ""Hey, you really offended that person, you should apologize."" They say the things no one else cares enough to say or too afraid to bring up.

* **The Backseat Gamer.** So bad that you need to make a rule of it. A backseat gamer can ruin an experience by spoiling key moments or constantly giving advice even though you made it clear you're not looking for any. You sometimes leave multiplayer lobbies ""invite only"" because you know they'll only drop in and make the game less challenging (or too challenging). Backseat gamers usually mean well, but at the expense of the streamer's experience.

* **The Creeper.** First it's flattering, especially if you're not used to being complimented on your appearance. Next, it gets unnecessary. Then is becomes unwelcomed. They talk about your genitals/privates, PM you about how much they adore you, and stalk your social media. Finally it starts to bother you enough that you have to consider banning them.

* **The Secret Billionaire.** They donate to you almost every stream in large amounts that catches everyone off guard. When someone donates or cheers, this person always has to ""one up"" them with a larger amount. A viewer bought a Tier 1 Sub? They buy a Tier 3. They love seeing the streamer in shock and their names on all the donation/bits leader-boards. Where do they get this money? Apparently that's none of yo business.

* **The Shameless Self-Promoter.** There will be streamers who want to ride on your success by trying to befriend you, but their real motive is so blatant. They indirectly try to bring your viewers into their stream with such things as asking if they can post their channel in your chat, asking for you to host them after your stream, or the worst in-chat offense: ""*Bye, I'll be streaming [insert game] in 5 minutes. You should stop by!*"" Then after the stream they ask you ""*Since I followed, mind following back?*"" ew...

* **the Borderline Troll.** This is someone who comes into your stream to get a kick out of annoying the streamer and/or chat. They want to get a reaction, but don't go as far as actually breaking the chat rules. So it's hard to deal with them since a timeout is only temporary and you don't want to babysit them with timeouts.

* **the Attention Seeker.** This is someone who, intentional or unintentional, brings attention away from the stream and chat onto themselves. They complain that they are having a rough day, got dumped by their boyfriend, or got into a car accident. Some of which are blatantly made up to get sympathy from the streamer and chat. And if they feel ignored, they make sure everyone knows. If the streamer skips their message in chat, they complain or even lash out against the streamer.

* **the Self-Appointed Mod.** This is someone who acts like a mod, but the problem is: they don't know the streamer's limits. So they attack anyone in chat even with low level offenses and ask the streamer to ban them even though it's not a ban-able offense. And if the streamer disagrees, they call out the streamer with showing favoritism.

* **the Person who hates EVERYONE (except you).** This is someone who gets along with the streamer and supports them, but anyone in chat? Not so much. They make rude comments, start arguments, and make a good portion of the chat feel not welcomed. Maybe it's jealously or maybe it's not, but whatever it is, it makes both the streamer and chat uncomfortable, especially if that person has been a long time friend.

* **the Rogue Mod.** At first you trusted this mod to follow your rules, but they end up ignoring it and controlling chat how they see fit: banning those who don't warrant a ban, making up rules, or other abuses of power. The worst possible situation is this mod turning the other mods against you. Once you de-mod them, headaches only get bigger. 

* **the Lurker.** That one viewer that always seems to be in your stream, but doesn't say a word. You want to say Hi and thank them or returning, but you know you shouldn't. Then hours into your stream when you do something amazing, they suddenly post a PogChamp. Your heart secretly fills with enjoy whenever you get a reaction from a longtime lurker.

* **The Interrupter.** ""Hey, when I tried to stream last night, it was laggy, can you help me?"" ""Did you know your Discord room is having an issue?"" Like, *Seriously?* Do we need to talk about this *now* while I'm streaming? They come into your stream to talk about something completely off topic that usually ends up taking away from the stream. They don't mean any harm, but their questions can always wait til after the stream or in a whisper.

* **The Hater.** A streamer who simply doesn't like you and doesn't want you to succeed. They spread rumors about you and come into your stream to bash you. What's worse is that they are in the chat of other streams you watch and even harass you there. Banning them only fuels their hatred towards you and will find other ways to attack you.

* **The Drama Queen/King.** Easily offended and made upset. Most streamers try to appease these people hoping they will stay, but it ends up being a toxic relationship. If triggered, these drama Queens/Kings announce to the stream that ""I'm unfollowing you because of how you treat me"" or ""Give me back my donation, you didn't say thank you"". It gets to a point that you really don't care and prefer them leave for the sake of the stream.

* **The Annoying lil' Sibling.** Not blood related at all, but sure acts like it. These people always wants to play with you and get upset when you don't want to. Always impatient when waiting their turn to play with you, they spam your inbox with invites. And if you don't close your lobby, they instantly jump into your game without asking. You fake happiness and force yourself to tolerate it to come off as nice, but let out a sigh of relief once they leave your game.

* **Those 2 People Always Flirting With Each Other.** Sexual innuendos, inside jokes, and more, these viewers can't get enough of each other. (so, can they please do it in private?) While you and the rest of the chat focus on the game on screen, they only focus on each other. At first you laugh and think it's cute, then it's sorta uncomfortable having to read the message to each other. 

* **That One Person Who Wants to Meet you IRL (that you avoid).** Makes you reconsider announcing the city you live in or your travel plans. Whenever they hear you'll be at a convention, they let you know where they are staying and they have an extra double bed. Or they live in the same state or province as you and constantly think of plans to meet up. The only issue is, the feeling is not mutual, and they can't take a hint it isn't.

* **The Contestant.** It's not a coincidence this person only shows up for giveaways and contests. They simply are following or lurking to accumulate points for a reward like a free game. Sure they don't really hurt the stream in any way, but with enough of these people in your stream, it really makes you reconsider doing giveaways and if your stream can grow without it.

8jlc7r,"Can we talk about ""networking"" and the nebulous language that goes with it?","Whenever I see articles, reddit posts, or youtube videos discussing Twitch growth, I'm hit over the head with the word networking.


Yes, I agree that it's crucial to growth. I understand that you need to partner with people for mutual gain, and that long-lasting friendships AND success can come from being genuinely helpful and friendly to those around you.


Here's my problem: Almost ALL of the advice on networking is nebulous at best, and misleading at worst. With the exception of some fantastic YouTube videos by SayNoToRage, there's a complete lack of specifics whenever networking is discussed.


I constantly see people say things like ""be genuine around other streamers,"" and ""help them out - don't just take, GIVE."" What the hell does that even mean? Outside of conversing in chat to give it some activity (which larger streams don't even need), what am I supposed to do? 


This advice feels like a buzzword that sounds nice to say and brings in some thread views and youtube hits, but I honestly have no idea where practicality comes into play.


The most I've been able to practically ""network"" is another streamer who started and became an affiliate at basically the same time I did. He's a little bigger than me due to being a music personality outside of Twitch, and after some Twitter interaction we're planning to stream some Fortnite duos this week.

I'd love to know what practical networking looks like, particularly for those of us who have a 9-5 job and can't hang out in a Twitch chat all day (which isn't really networking anyway).

8ix7e4,6.6% revenue from subs is considered normal for Twitch support,"//update:

update2:

got some more automated answers. according to them everything is working as expected and the subscriptions got refunded, thats why I got no revenue from them. When I asked how it is possible for the Dashboard to look 2 months into the future to see cancelled subs 2month later and update that 0.00$ revenue on the first day i got this sub and that i am surprised, that you can cancel subscriptions after 2 months (and an automatic renewal) they just sent me this:   


&gt;Hello genbatzu,  The system is working as expected, unfortunately the way that your revenue was offset caused this confusion. I do apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you!

**update:**

got an answer from twitch support yesterday, and it wasn't a standardized macro answer! instead **they acknowledged that ""it seems that not all of the sub revenue is being reported to \[my\] dashboard.""**

\---

[https://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2018-05hbow3.png](https://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2018-05hbow3.png)

First of all, I'm an affiliate on twitch, so I'm eligible to receive cheers and subs. last month something strange happened, as on one day i got 3 subs (2 tier 1, $5; 1 tier 3, $25). As everyone knows, affiliate split is 50/50 **after** tax, fees, etc.

However, from these $35 subs I received $2.31, which is pretty much exactly 6.6&amp;#37; **before** I pay taxes and withdraw fees, etc. Or another way to look at it is, that i got the correct cut of 50&amp;#37; after tax, etc. from 1 Tier1 Sub, and got 0&amp;#37; cut from 2 subscriptions (1 Tier1, 1 Tier3). The latter is most likely, but doesn't make for a dramatic title.

I obviously contacted support about it, a week later, because I thought it might just isn't updated correctly or something so I waited a bit, but the conversation with the support dragged on after I contacted it.

First of all they seemed to acknowledge the problem, as the support employee escalated it to the finance department after I've provided a couple of screenshots.

2 weeks later I got a standardized macro answer that I should switch to google DNS, which should solve the problem. This obviously didn't solve anything and I was using google DNS anyway. So I answered, that I already use google DNS and it didnt fix anything.

A day later I got another standardized macro answer, that the payout is correct, and I can read about the certain cost, fees and taxes that apply in the Twitch Affiliate Program. As I'm not a US citizen I pay my own taxes on twitch gains, so they can't mean my income taxes (I have no clue how US citizen handle that, but there was something about that in the amazon agreement about it), but I assume they mean VAT.

2 of these Subscriptions got renewed this month (both Tier1 subs) and revenue this time was $2.31 again, which leads me to believe that one sub is working and the 2nd one is ""faulty"" and ""produced"" a revenue of 0&amp;#37;/$.

I replied again, obviously and told them that it's really strange to have $2.30 revenue from $35 subs and after that I got yet another standardized macro answer, telling me that it's usually caused by cancelled subscriptions, which aren't reflected on that specific day, but on a later day as a negative revenue number and I don't have to worry, I don't own Twitch money for it (how nice).

A cancelled Subscription wasn't the case (of course). So I explained it again, that it can't be that either, because these subscribers are using sub emote(s), till today, so they can't have cancelled their subs.

**tl;dr** from $35 sub revenue I received $2.31 and Twitch first acknowledged that as an error, then told me to change my DNS settings, then told me it's working as expected and all is fine and finally told me it's because of cancelled subscription, which it's not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8ix7e4/66_revenue_from_subs_is_considered_normal_for/,1526143229.0,379,0.94,50,Twitch,genbatzu

8iop4l,How many streamers (full/part time) still play games on their own time?,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. 

As of right now, I've noticed some minor success \(5 \- 10 viewers per stream\) and I've been mostly able to play the games I want on stream. I'm currently taking a mini break from streaming to recover from some minor burnout. Lately I've been wondering about other streamers and how they manage their free time. As of right now I am looking for a job so free time as well as streaming isn't an issue for me. One thing that has bothered me though is the prospect of getting a full time job and still finding time to stream, take care of IRL things, and of course having ""me time."" Sometimes I just want to veg in front of the computer by myself, play a completely obscure JRPG, and not worry about all the things that come with streaming.

So my question then for you is how do YOU manage your free time? Are you still able to play games away from stream, or is the notion of playing games on stream good enough for you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8iop4l/how_many_streamers_fullpart_time_still_play_games/,1526053030.0,70,0.91,53,Twitch,[deleted]
8ii0s8,Full-time streamer loses 4 years of invested time due to ISP.,"Let me introduce myself, I am the twitch streamer Hanjarolol, I am a father to 2 beautiful girls and a husband to an amazing wife and this is my story that i'm hoping gets noticed. I felt I needed to plead my case to the world at this point.

 Over the last 4 and a half years, I have put in 10-14 hours a day, 6-7 days a week. for a solid 2 years I did not take days off to develop my stream to the point of an average of about 150 concurrent viewers. This is where my issues began. In the fall of 2017 I moved with my family to southwest Missouri after looking long and hard for a house near my wife's family but also with stable cable internet. I found a house in a suburb of Springfield, Missouri. It was perfect for my family! After our move I got everything setup and ready to stream, exhausting 2000 mile drive, but I made it! After a few months of stable connectivity I began noticing some upstream issues and started running daily speedtests to find out what was happening.

 At first glance being on a residential plan I assumed perhaps I had hit my data limit of 2 TB a month. However, this was not the case. After getting multiple techs out to my home and replacing modems, all lines from my tap to my home, I still had issues with my internet. My upstream would not go above 1-2 mb/s and these were not solid speeds because I was stuck streaming at less than 400 bitrate(400kb/s at 480p) and still losing about 30% of my frames. These issues started in late November of 2017 and and are still occurring as we speak. I have had countless contacts with the Technical Operations Supervisor and have more than 10 tech visits to my home to try to pinpoint a problem that I KNOW is on their main line between my tap and their amplifier to my area(I know this because they ran a power line from their van to my modem plugged my modem directly into the drop line to my tap and the speeds were still bad.) 

In the 6 months this has been occurring I have watched my stream fall from 150 viewer average to about a 15 viewer average, losing thousands upon thousands of dollars in income and  well over 10000 hours of invested time creating my stream, all while this company does nothing to help me. I feel very victimized by my ISP and there are no alternatives in this area other than at&amp;t adsl 10/1 or satellite. Can we get this noticed and make it go big so we can get some eyes from Mediacom Corporate Headquarters? I am out of options at this point for streaming and am hoping for some sort of notice so we can actually get some resolve. I appreciate your time guys. Thanks for reading my story.


tl:dr Spent 4 years developing stream to full-time income worthy state, lose all viewers due to no longer being able to stream a decent quality without massive drops due to ISP not fixing problems on their end in a timely manner.

update: It is fixed!! An amplifier on the next street over was causing feedback onto my line and they finally found the issue...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8ii0s8/fulltime_streamer_loses_4_years_of_invested_time/,1525984279.0,1225,0.86,303,Twitch,Hanjaro31

8hbbo0,Tokyo is Getting Its Own Twitch Stream,"**Tokyo is Getting Its Own Twitch Stream**


Announced via @Franke Twitter — 

Twitch has partnered with **PROBLEM** to debut the first-ever city specific live stream on its network.



The **/Tokyo** stream will feature exclusive Tokyo-based content from local creators and personalities, and while some of the creators have existing Twitch channels, most of the new and exclusive content will debut beginning in mid May.



The program is aiming to provide a more honest and youthful perspective of the city, seen “IRL"" through the eyes of both natives and ex-pats — a stark contrast to Japan’s more traditional tourism marketing and, in many ways, its mass-market global image.



And while you should expect unique, first-hand perspectives on Japanese culture, commerce and cuisine, everything from underground experiences to systemic and taboo social issues will also be explored.

8fplf2,"A Warning to Streamers of any Jackbox games, and this weird, small, racist community","I'm a small streamer who'd play Quiplash with friends before, so i thought ""Why not stream it"". Things go well for awhile before I spike 10/15 viewers. They asked for my discord and joined it and spammed racist messages everywhere. After I ended stream awhile later, I did some research on some of the users. Turns out, there's a community of people that play Quiplash who have racist chats who spam the TriHard (apparently use it instead of other racist words) emotes on other peoples streams. In my case, a streamer w/ 1000+ followers led the charge, and he personally joined and spammed stuff like ""Mod me and Ill clear you of the N****Rs"". These guys stream and act against the racism in their chats on stream so they don't get reported, then do this to others. Someone in my chat made it seem like a regular thing to occur. So, if you plan on streaming Quiplash or other jackbox games, be prepared, especially if it's your first time doing it. I wanted to put something here in case you are a small streamer, like me, who considered doing this.

**1. Make sure to have a mod or two in stream with you**
- I was lucky I had a couple of guys join me. You'll prob need some help banning and timing out these guys. For a small stream, it can be a lot, especially if it's your first time dealing with it like me. Also, don’t add any new viewers as mod. It’s a part of their scheme to the raid, so only mod any regular viewers or people you know. 

**2. If they ask for any external server you have, DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM.**
- The second someone spams something racist, then someone asks for a discord, don't give it to them. If you have the proper security for it, then do it. But they all joined and spammed on there. They were smart in doing this since you can't report them at twitch for a discord issue (*turns out you can report twitch, so don't delete your server like I did*). 

**3. If you plan on playing with viewers, be prepared to kick.**
- I didn't know until today that the newer version of Quiplash allows you to kick people, so if you plan on streaming that, try to get that version. I don't know how the other games are, but if you have someone being edgy in your game, be prepared to kick them or restart a game. Also, you can turn on twitch login so you can spot viewers easier if they don’t listen to your rules (hit the cog on the top left on jackbox’s site)

**4. Only give codes to people you're close with or to regulars.**
Thanks to u/TimeWaster91 for making me remember this. I did this by whispering friends and regulars and hiding the screen. Of course a random viewer is a lot more likely to ruin the stream than others. 


I know that very few people have even considered streaming these games, but if I can even find one person that I can help, that'd be cool. It was my craziest stream I had to date, and I hope to spread the word around. If you are a stream looking to interact with viewers, it's a great way to do so. Good luck to all!

*Edit There’ve been a lot of replies from people who know a lot more than me, so if this concerns you, scroll through em. I also just wanted to acknowledge that this is a far bigger issue than these games. I know a lot of twitch is like this and it is truly sad. I did a vague search of the posts but didn't see much on these games, but I was hoping this small list might prepare even 1 person :) Also, if these people raid your discord or whatever you do, you can report them to discord or even twitch (thanks u/boothin) with the new TOS, so don't make my mistake and delete it. Keep that evidence*

*final edit: I did more research and a lot of the games from the Jackbox party pack 3 and newer have streaming features like having twitch logon forced, so you can see the usernames of your players. There’s also other censorship settings that aid in helping. They’ve actually made great strides in helping streamers, so I applaud Jackbox, but still keep everything else here in mind in case you get raided. *",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8fplf2/a_warning_to_streamers_of_any_jackbox_games_and/,1524981730.0,445,0.88,89,Twitch,thescann

8f7rjd,Getting discovered on Twitch: results from our community survey,"Hey /r/Twitch :

A while back we asked you all for your feedback on what’s most important when it comes to finding new streams, or what you do to attract new viewers if you’re a streamer.  We’ve tallied the responses and wanted to share the most interesting findings with you.  There’s a link at the bottom to the full article but the highlights are here.  We’re still collecting responses too and there’s a link to the survey in the article on our site.

On to the good stuff.

Participants (self-identified as primary role)

* 61% streamers 
* 39% viewers 

Top factors in viewer choice

* Microphone - 79%
* Face cam - 63%
* Reliable streaming schedule - 40%
* Detailed profile - 32%

Top tactics utilized by streamers

* Microphone - 96%
* Face cam - 75%
* Reliable streaming schedule - 70%
* Discord / Detailed streaming profile - 57% / 56% 

Largest gaps between the two groups (streamer vs. viewer)

* Discord server - 57% vs. 13%
* Affiliate / Partner status - 44% vs. 9%
* Background music - 35% vs. 22%

**Conclusions**

For the most part, viewers expectations and wants are well aligned with the tactics streamers are using.  While many will argue a face cam and microphone aren’t a must, our data is indicating it’s generally a good idea.  

We asked about many other factors as well and the biggest takeaways were that giveaways weren’t very influential for viewers - and definitely not for long-term channel growth, and sub-only / follower-only modes were equally very unpopular.

**Social media**

Over 70% of viewers indicated they follow their favorite streamers on social media.  Aside from reinforcing the obvious, this is also a strong signal that streamers should focus on a social strategy that isn’t just “hey guys I’m live”.  The IRL section has shown us that viewers are interested in the non-gaming lives of streamers and social media is a great window into that side of their lives.  So, to the extent you’re comfortable, investing in a more personal social strategy may pay dividends.  

On top of this, nearly 90% of viewers reported they shared a favorite streamer with their network of friends.  Anything streamers can do to encourage and promote this is recommended.  Organic growth is the best way to build a long-term viewer base.  It takes time but it’s worth it.

Primary factors influencing viewers to follow or subscribe

* Overall entertainment value -  almost 100%
* Audience engagement - 84%
* Sportsmanship - 60%
* Skill at the game or task - 53% 

These are the characteristics we’ve identified and labeled as **StreamDNA**.  They’re core to what we’re building at at StreamKick and crucial for differentiating content from just a game directory and viewer count.

This feedback was the biggest thing we uncovered, without a doubt.  The general consensus in the community is that a streamer either needs to be entertaining OR good at a particular game to break out and build a following.  What we’ve learned here is that not only is skill NOT that important, it’s actually the least important of the four attributes we’ve identified.  Even sportsmanship - basically attitude in general - ranked higher.

8e5xae,A Truly Helpful Guide on Making your Webcam Look Better,"# Lighting. That is the core of it. 

https://imgur.com/a/mbUOZEm

This is a bad picture of the lights I use to make my webcam look good.

And I dont use the room light.

On the left I have a ~20 CAD total Tertial Lamp from Ikea with an LED bulb in it, pointed to my green screen and some to my face. Since its LED and has next to no heat, I just taped some white nylon on it to soften the light. 

Above my webcam I have a ~15 CAD USB clamp lamp from amazon, it supposedly is 800 lumens - it points at my face directly. It also has tape holding white nylon to soften it placed on the lamp head.

Between the 2 I've cut out a lot of shadows. Ideally I would have a key light in front, 2 lights to the side, but space and budget prevent me from doing this. 

Now I will concede its the not ultra budget friendly C920 webcam, but the cam is standard for a reason. Its good quality, and with good lighting looks good. It goes on sale ALL the time, its worth investing in it if you're concerned about camera quality but really, even slightly lower down the list cam will do fine if you LIGHT IT WELL. 

Now for me, step 2 if you want it helps a bit more. 

# Camera settings!

## OBS Settings

Its actually dead simple: Just use the 720 setting, it will reduce cpu load from loading in the camera as a source on OBS. If you do full screen and your cpu can handle it do 1080 (if your canvas is 1080). Just to avoid upscaling then downsampling the cam after - it just makes it look a bit better. 

Change the source video format to MJPEG in obs. It helps keep things look even nicer. I dont remember where I read to do this, probably here or on the official OBS forums and it makes the colours more accurate, less washed out. 

## Webcam Settings

Now go into your webcam settings, for me its logitech webcam settings, might be different if you're using microsoft software, but most cams have Exposure/Gain settings. 

Turn down the exposure. Don't use auto. Higher exposure introduces ghosting and appears like a laggy webcam. 

You need to set these based on your lighting! And make the lighting consistent! 

My exposure is barely a third of the way up. What you're trying to do is find an exposure where you can see well based on the lighting you have without blowing out anything that is white in colour. You can use gain for adjusting a ""dark"" image, but if either is set too high you begin to see a lot of ""grain"" in the video. 

Play with this until you're happy. 

Turn off auto-white balance. Set this yourself. Make sure you have a bit of colour to your skin tone but not so much you change skin tones. 

Also turn off auto-focus. If you are always the same basic distance from your webcam focus it yourself and leave it. I went the easy route and set my cam to landscape mode. 

# Green Screen Tips

Now if you're also using a green screen like me - I use a floodlight I got for 20 bucks online LED and point it to the green screen. Green screens should be lit seperately as much as possible. I kinda do this but had to trick it with the big lamp pointing at me AND the green screen top left corner. 

Just make sure all your lights have the same ""warmness"" so that you can set whitebalance consistently. For me, everything is a daylight LED bulb, this way my one white balance applies to everything. 

# Filters

Don't add any colour filters, don't add any sharpness filters, dont add any filters at all honestly unless theres a reason. And if the reason is to make your image ""more accurate"" stop. Go buy a brighter lamp. Clamp it to your desk or your monitor or wherever and point it at your face first. 

Then manually set exposure/gain/white balance/focus. You'll get much much more. If your webcam doesn't support these features and its permanently locked to auto I sincerely suggest just saving up and getting a cam that does. Logitech 310 and MS lifecam are even more budget options than a sale C920 and they at least have those basic features the last I checked. 

Now there is more even I can do to improve my existing lighting solution. But with my current budget/living situation this is where I am at.

8e0lml,OBS Mastering 102: Facecams and making the picture from your webcam better.,"Hello and welcome back to a multiple part series on OBS studio. This week, we will *ahem* focus on face-cams and how to improve them.

---

#Introducing the Facecam, or Camera focused on your face

A facecam is an amazing tool used by streamers and VOD creators to bring a more ""human to human"" interaction than just a voice or text between you, the POI in a stream/VOD, and your audience.

To start, we will need a Video source to input into your pc. You have a few choices to choose from:

- A Webcam, the cheapest and simplest way to create a facecam for your stream
- A Smartphone, A bit more involved to set up, much better quality than a webcam(depending on the smartphone model), However, it has several drawbacks that make it less desirable than a quality webcam. This is for those who have a old smartphone and no webcam or other means to have a face cam.
- An Analog/Digital Camcorder or Digital Camera; Almost always a better choice than a smartphone or Webcam as they have large lenses and sensors. The drawbacks to these options is Limited support. Not all models can function as a high fidelity webcam, and needs a tripod or some other mounting mechanism to work.
- And finally, a High budget DSLR. These are fairly simple to set up if they have certain outputs but can get very expensive very quickly. They also require a sturdy mounting mechanism as they can get very heavy with bigger lenses.

Before you go and buy anything, **look around your house for old camcorders or digital cameras that have been shelved away**, even old digital cameras or camcorders are almost guaranteed to be better than a webcam.

##Sample video of the results of using this guide.

After using this guide, your webcam should look something like [this](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/253307084) using a cheap Logitech C525 webcam.

---

##Lights, Camera, and you.

Before we go any further, I need to say this: You ***WILL*** need to introduce light into your environment to produce a clear, High-quality image from any of these methods. This means that you will need to spend some money on some lights for your ""studio"". Lighting is an essential part of our facecam environment and can be the difference between being perceived as a potential serial killer, or a saint, and everything in between.

For those on an ultra-tight budget, all is not lost. If you have any desk lamps or standing lamps, you can position them behind your monitors, above your webcam, facing downwards towards your face, where possible. This gives a natural Light source, not dissimilar to that of the sun over our heads. But we will need light.

###Budget Options:($20-$60)

For those with a small budget, You can invest in things like a small ring light to act as an adjustable key light.

I have [this particular item in my setup](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA94K6WW0978), mounted behind my desk, and have an old smartphone in the holder running ARX Control for my Logitech keyboard, showing me at a glance what scene each G key transitions to.

However, it is worth noting that the light produced by this particular light is fairly harsh, and will potentially strain your eyes.

Benefits of a ring light:

- Small footprint: It won't take up a lot of room.
- Easy to setup: Simply plug it into a USB port, and turn it on
- One of the cheapest solutions.
- Usually easy to mount

Drawbacks:

- Harsh light
 - This creates significant eye strain
 - Hard shadows, potentially creating a strong contrast in your webcam and over darkening parts you may want visible.
- Not easy to replace any burnt out led's. You may have to buy a new ring light once it fails.

###Softbox lighting: ($35-$150+)

Softbox lighting is used by professional photographers and video production specialists around the world, and for good reason. 

A softbox is, at its core, a high powered light behind a diffuser screen. The diffuser screen is where the magic comes into play. It catches the photons emitted by the light source, and scatters them in various directions; reducing the intensity of the light significantly, and producing a wide-spread soft light that is **Excellent** for illuminating a POI, in this case, you, the streamer.

Benefits include:

- Soft Light
 - Low strain on your eyes
 - Soft shadows, a more ""normalized"" shadow one would expect from things like sunlight shadows.
- Even Light
 - Your subject will be well lit. It will appear more natural

Drawbacks:

- Bulky; Softboxes start big, and only get bigger.
 - Takes up a lot of real estate on your ""studio""
- Expensive: For a 3 point softbox light setup, you are looking at a minimum of $75-$200

###The Ideal setup: Lighting

Ideally, you want to aim for at least a 3-point setup, in which you have three light sources in your ""studio"". Detailed in [this guide on Lighting](https://thekidtroddresearch.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/3-and-4-point-lighting/) It explains the benefits of such a setup better than I ever could, and how to orient those lights, or even 4-point if you want that level of detail.

####At least the Key Light!

Having at least a key light is recommended if you are streaming, as it ***Vastly*** improves the picture quality of any camera or webcam you choose. See [Here](https://i.imgur.com/U2l0xsa.png) for an example.

---

##Option 1: A Webcam (Budget: $20-$200)

Usually the go-to plug-and-play option, A webcam is the least hassle to set up and is what most streamers will use in their day-to-day streams.

###Setting up the Webcam

To use a webcam with OBS

- Click the + inside of the sources section
- Select ""Video Capture Device"" 
- Select the webcam

Now, you should be able to see the webcam feed directly on the OBS preview window. By default, the image generally is less than desirable.

####Video Mastering: Getting your feet wet

We have a few software settings to change around.

- Right-click the Webcam source
- Select Properties
- For Resolution/FPS Type, Select Custom
- For Resolution, Select 1280x720.
 - 720p generally is used for webcams, as higher resolutions have a tendency to produce stuttering in the video feed. We want the most fluid feed possible so your audience doesn't pick up on any stuttering.
- For FPS, Select ""Match output FPS"" 
 - Alternatively, you may specify 30 or 60 fps(Whatever your device can handle without stuttering)
- For Video Format, there are three options for most modern webcams. I choose to use I420, as it produces the clearest image. Play with these to produce the best looking picture to you.
 - [Source](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/i420-mjpeg-xrgb.62400/):
 - I420 - moderate compression (only color compressed, moderate bandwidth required)
 - MJPEG - high compression (low bandwidth required)
 - XRGB - no compression (high bandwidth required)
- For YUV Color Space, Select the option that looks best to you.
- For YUV Color Range, I prefer Full.
- For Buffering, Enable or disable. 
- Audio output on a webcam should only ever be used if it is the only option available to you within your budget.

####Ankle deep in the digital mire

Now, we need to go in our webcam and change a few more settings.

- Scroll back up to the top of the properties for the webcam until you see three buttons ""Deactivate"", ""Configure Video"" , ""Configure Crossbar""
- Select ""Configure Video""
 - In my Logitech C525, I have Three Tabs. Starting in the Webcam control, Zoom the webcam all the way out
 - Uncheck everything. Enable ""follow my face"" if you want to, but I feel a static, unmoving frame is best.
 - Drag the focus slider to the far right, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to inch it over to the left as far as you can without causing edge artifacts.
 - Under the ""Advanced settings"" tab, uncheck the image quality RightLight box. This will give us control over the exposure and Gain setting sliders
 - You want the Exposure and gain settings as low as they can go while retaining a clear image of yourself. This puts less load on the internal hardware, granting more fluid video reproduction.
 - Adjust the brightness and contrast levels until a desirable result emerges
 - Color intensity is up to you.
 - White balance should be set manual, and adjusted until the colors look natural.
 - Set Anti-flicker on to the corresponding formats if you have light flicker visible in the frame. Otherwise, set it to ""Off"" to free up some resources,
 - Mirror, or don't. Your choice,
 - Don't forget to save!

####Fully Submersed in the ocean of possibilities, you need only catch the fish you are looking for.

Next, we are going to add a few filters to our webcam feed to further improve the fidelity

- Right click on our webcam source
- Select ""Filters""
- Under ""Effect filters""
- Click the + sign
- Select ""Sharpen"" Use very low values here, as high values will introduce artifacts. I have mine set to 0.22
- Click the + sign again
- Select ""Color Correction""
 - This filter is very powerful for a feature limited webcam. Play with the settings here, but avoid using extreme values to the left or the right on the sliders.
 - For reference, My settings from top to bottom: -0.06, 0.28, 0.04, -0.25, -8.85, 100
 - For the Color correction color, I use #ffe5af. Depending on your light source(I go into detail on light sources later.) this value may need to be tweaked.
- (optional) Select the + sign again
- Select ""Apply LUT""
 - OBS Studio comes with 4 by default(technically 3) Select them and see what they do. Then go [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-cinematic-lut-pack.580/) to download a free pack and play with them until the colors match your preference.
 - There are many hundreds of LUT files to choose from. Some are free, while others are paid. These go along way to achieve the look you are trying to create for your face can source.

###The impossible hurdle is a tiny one.

However, a webcam has two fairly big drawbacks, one that cannot be overcome.

- The Digital sensor is Tiny. This means that the webcam does not produce a super clear picture and may be very grainy, as it does not gather a whole lot of light. This cannot be fixed.
- Lacks the ability to swap lenses. We can get around this with some DIY ingenuity. 

####Work around these issues

So, I was messing around with an old pair of reading glasses from Wal-mart and decided on a whim to place one of the lenses over the webcam camera. I was blown away by the result. I suddenly became more in focus than I ever managed to do before, and I was able to make out individual hairs on my head as opposed to a ""Splash of color"" I was getting before.(I had to get closer to the webcam to see them, but the point remains that it greatly improved the sharpness without using a powerful filter in OBS) It got me thinking. Assuming you have a way to mount it, you can use lenses on your webcam to further improve the image quality. They are making ones for cellphones [here](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=cell+phone+lens) and they will likely work for our webcams as well. If you have an additional $20, I believe these are potentially great additions to your webcam.

##Option 2: Smartphone...?!

So this next option is for those who have old smartphones laying in a drawer collecting dust. I do not recommend buying a new smartphone for this purpose, because other options are better for the money.

You will need:

- Wifi in your house
- A fairly ""new"" old cellphone that you are no longer using.

Using the power of an app and the browser source(Or VLC Media Source set up properly) in OBS, we can use our old smartphone Camera as a Webcam! 

The phone does not need to be active by service providers like MetroPCS or Verizon, so you won't need to pay a monthly fee to them to use your webcam!

One such App is [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;hl=en_US), but almost all video surveillance apps will work.


The Benefits of using an old Smartphone:

- More likely to get 1080p video from it to downscale to 720p later
- Far more powerful processing wise than a standard webcam, allowing us more headroom to play with it
- Can also be used to do other things than ""Just a webcam"" that is helpful, like [ARX Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logitech.gaming.arxcontrolapp&amp;hl=en_US), or [Twitch chat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tchat&amp;hl=en) monitoring to a small screen so you don't need to dedicate space on your streaming pc.
- Built-in LED light(though I don't recommend using it. It is usually extremely bright.)

The Drawbacks of using a smartphone:

- Still not the best sensors available, but generally are much better than a webcam
- The strain on your wifi. The higher the resolution, the bigger the strain.
- Requires a mounting mechanism to make use of the smartphone's camera
- Bulky: A smartphone is much larger than modern webcams.
- Security: If your old smartphone is infected with a virus, you are opening the possibility of it leeching into your home network pc or even just spying on you with the same webcam feature you use it for.
- Being over the air vs over a wire, you add latency to the video. You will likely need to delay your mic audio to sync if being used as a facecam.

The lenses mentioned in option 1 are designed for smartphones...so that still applies here. [The link](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=cell+phone+lens), for convenience.

Once the App is set up and the OBS source is selected as the IP address in the browser source, the setup is the same as option 1.

---

##Option 3: The Digital Camera

**Disclaimer:** *Not all Digital cameras support webcam use, such as my PixPro FZ152*

A digital camera is the next level in the face-cam options.

This device is designed to take high-resolution still frame pictures, but more recently, come with the ability to record video to an SD card. Some designs even allow you to input the video output through USB, which is what we can utilize to capture the video to our PC's for streaming.

###Know what can and can not function as a webcam

There are a lot of digital cameras on the market right now, but in order to use them as a webcam, it needs to have one of these things:

- Over HDMI into a capture card, Such as the [Sony a6000](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-3-0-Inch/dp/B00I8BICB2?th=1) ***$548****as of 04/27/2018* [Elgato Cam Link](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0748QYPX9/diy0c-20/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B0748QYPX9&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=xQkMSrSqFS9nkZU1Ys79.A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;th=1)
- Over USB. Unconfirmed support for [Sony DSCW800](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-DSCW800-Digital-Camera-Black/dp/B00I8BIBCW) ***$88****as of 04/27/2018* This particular camera has a mini-HDMI out so you can still use the cam link above.

Using this guide noted [here](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-use-a-digital-camera-as-a-webcam)*YMMV* will explain how to do it for the cameras that can use it over USB.

One final thing you will need is a dummy battery that will work in the specific digital camera you are using. While this is technically optional(Your battery may just die and face-cam cut out), you just need to know that you need to be able to charge the device while outputting video

- [A6000](https://www.amazon.com/AC-PW20-Adapter-Replacement-NP-FW50-DSC-RX10/dp/B076HSGG3V/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1524875441&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=a6000+dummy+battery&amp;psc=1)
- The Sony DSCW800 cannot use a dummy battery, you will need to be able to plug in the micro USB cable to charge the device while using it.

**Benefits:**
- Significant improvement in video quality over a webcam
- Over the Cam Link, in particular, it recognizes as a webcam device, improving compatibility with things like Skype calls or discord calls etc.

**Drawbacks:**

- Expensive: The price starts at $80 and only goes up from there, or at $200 if you need to use the Cam Link.
- You need a camera with a ""clean HDMI"" out to avoid overlays included on the camera itself.


###Option 3b: Camcorder as webcam

Similarly, you can use a camcorder using a similar method of capture as mentioned above. Camcoders are being phased out in favor of digital cameras that double over as a camcorder, but if you have one sitting collecting dust, and are using a webcam now or nothing at all, it is worth a shot to see if you can produce a better image with it.

Similarly, you will need a dummy battery for the model you have, and a mounting mechanism such as a tripod.

Camcorders add a level of complexity in that it can be digital, or analog. For analog, you will need a capture card with analog input, for Digital, you may be able to use a HDMI out and capture VIA the Elgato Cam Link.

**Benefits:**
- Improved quality over Webcams, though YMMV depending on the model used.
- Large lenses as compared to webcams
- Large sensors as compared to webcams

**Drawbacks:**
- They can be fairly bulky and large
- Can be Heavy
- Might produce bad video quality depending on age and type
- Analog adds an additional layer of complexity in the setup.

8duggh,Just a simple thanks.,"   I have been off and on streaming for 7 months now. After 3 months the first time i was getting about 30+ concurrent viewers. It felt amazing. But i had a problem drinking. I would miss days on my schedule. Stop being goofy. And at my worst pass out on steam or black out crawl out of room. God. Rewatching that vod really threw me into a depression. 


   I had tried a couple times to come back but always fell short and messed it up. 


   Well not today.


  I am today 6 days sober. And i had a rough day. I was going to drink tonight but instead i said fuck it lets just try to calm down through twitch. So i steamed sober and even put that in my title. 


   I had a blast. I had other sober streamers come in and encourage me. It was great. 


   So thank you twitch for giving me a platform of encouragement.  Thank you for helping me stay sober another day. 


   I will continue to do this. I will use twitch as a sort of accountability check. And i look forward to 7 days sober. And i look forward to my next stream.



Goodnight.

-edit- man i don't really know what to say. I'm overwhelmed  today from all of you. Everything from encouragement to advice on people to listen to. Bojack and even some one gilding me. Thank you all.

And now I have a cheer and sub button!*"" They post threads about ""*how I become affiliate in TWO weeks! And YOU can too by following MY advice!*"" However, I *do* think you should be proud about being an affiliate, but turn it down a few notches. The path from affiliate to partner is a grind. Affiliate is more of a rite of passage with as much merit as getting a driver's license and calling yourself an adult.

*EDIT:* Come to think of it, I've noticed an increase of streamers who want to be an affiliate ask for ""follow for follow"" and ""lurk for lurk"" to meet the affiliate requirements. There are entire discord and twitter communities to boost streamers into affiliate status this way. Sorta sad imo...

8ce3fb,Thing I learned: Watch your own stream videos!,"So this seems like it should be pretty common sense I'm sure, but for whatever reason, I never thought about it until pretty recently. 

So yes, watch your archived videos of your streams.  You'll get a whole different perspective than what you experience as the person recording the stream.  You'll get to see it from your viewers' side, along with all the a/v issues you might have, quality issues, content issues, EVERYTHING.  

And dont just think that a 5 minute clip is enough.  Literally try to sit there through as much of your video as you can.  Do you enjoy watching the show you're putting on?  Are you having fun?  Does it seem like you're interacting with people in chat enough?  Are you just looking for excuses to alt-tab to something else and stop watching the stream?  if so, figure out why.  Take notes on the little (or big) things that you notice need to be changed.

For me, a couple things that stood out are issues with audio levels because despite doing checks pre-stream, for whatever reason every device and every set of headphones I try to use to watch my tests outputs wildly different audio levels.  which also seem to be different from the audio in the videos.  and then people in chat tell me my levels are off and things get wonky.  I still dont have a great solution for that yet, but I'm working on figuring one out.  Or another thing is that I have my webcam on the monitor in front of me, but my stream chat on my right-hand monitor.  So every time I interact with people in chat, it looks to them like I'm looking away.  and its weird.

For real though, if you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot.  what sort of things stand out to you?

8b95zy,The power of budget lighting solutions,"I want to preface on how I always thought my room light only was already pretty good and that all the budget solutions for lighting I found was always so expensive.

I once came across a post of people talking about the Razer Kiyo and how, when you already have a C920, getting a cheap RingLight instead was a better solution than changing webcams.

Oh boy... they were right!

I have bought a Neewer ringlight which is powered on USB, has a phone holder, and was only 16 euros. Then I changed the C920 controls to manual and am able to run my gain to 0% and brightness to a decent setting for good exposure, and whitebalance almost in the middle.

I did add a free LUT (Golden Hour) at 0.1 (so 10%) in the webcam filter, which I found on the OBS forums.

The difference of just room lights and room lights with a cheap ringlight was MASSIVE to the overall webcam quality.

Like. I have no before picture, but it's like this now: https://i.imgur.com/2UdPRgB.png

The reason I have no before picture is that my PC is currently in repair, and cannot show you my settings because of it (long story short: don't mess around with BIOS modifications on a system without dual BIOS. It's not as risk free as overclocking when you know what you're doing)

I do notice that when it's night, I don't even need to change the gain or brightness, not even the whitebalance.

This [Neewer Ringlight](https://www.amazon.de/Neewer-Handyhalter-Live%C3%BCbertragung-Licht-Modelle-Helligkeit/dp/B0771KYBKR/ref=sr_1_9?s=photo&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522094441&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=usb%2Bring%2Blight&amp;th=1) has three color settings.

In daylight I use the ""balanced color"" mode, which enables both blue and reddish tint, and in the night I simply use the ""warm"" tint, where the blue lights are disabled.

And the effect it has on the webcam quality is that the picture stays consistent throughout daytime by only changing the light's color.

#**Audio Decibels and you.**

We start this section off talking about Audio levels, or decibels. For the acoustically unattuned, a decibel is a unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale. At its very core, it is simply the measurement of vibration in a medium.

Here is some food for thought. A Sound of 1,100 decibels would create a black hole larger than the entire observable universe. [Source](https://www.youredm.com/2015/10/13/a-sound-of-1100-decibels-would-create-a-black-hole-larger-than-the-universe/)

Back on subject...

-------------------------------------------------------------


##**Update 05/25/18: Windows 10 April Creators update**

There was a new update released for windows that is a bit of a game changer.

If you type ""Mixer"" and select ""Sound Mixer Options"" in the Cortana search bar, you will bring up the new windows 10 audio sources screen PER APPLICATION.

This lets us define sources in order to better control our audio levels, And making it so we no longer have to use ""Default devices"" for anything!

I Recommend using 4 output devices and 1 input device. 

###**Device Designation**

You do not want to output any audio programs to your headphones(I'll explain why later)

Music - Assign this to any non-headphone device. Remember your choice for later.

Discord - Assign input to your Mic of choice and output to a separate device from Music. Again, Remember choice for later.

Game sounds - Assign this to a separate device from Discord and music. Again, doesn't matter much WHICH device, but just remember which one for later.

*optional* Music 2 - Assign a separate device from All other channels to be output to stream, Remember the choice.

####**OBS Setup**

In OBS, go into Settings &gt; Audio And set ALL Audio Devices to ""Disabled"" This is IMPORTANT. These devices are ""Global"" across all scenes. We want more control, so we want these disabled.

Now, go into Settings &gt; Advanced and select your Headphones for Audio Monitoring Device.

Next, you want to create a New Scene. Name it ""Standard Audio Channels"" or something of that nature.

Now, Add a New Audio Output Source, and name it ""Music.""

- Select the Device you chose in the previous Section for ""Music"".

Repeat this step for every other channel you made in the previous Section, for Microphone, Select the Audio input Source and name it ""Microphone"".

Now, all you need to to to add these audio tracks to different scenes are:

- Click + in ""Sources""
- Click Scene
- Select ""Standard Audio Channels""

Congratulations, you now have scene specific control over what audio channels go where in OBS!

If you want only certain audio tracks going to certain scenes (like music only for an afk scene) all you need to do is add ""Music"" audio output from existing sources.

This makes your mic muted while afk as an added benefit.

---------------------------------------
 

##**Balance. Harmony. What was that? My music was too loud!**

I'm sure we've all been there. We are playing a game of...Rocket league. Your teammate calls out ""I got it, I got it."" and you, jamming out to those sweet tunes, miss his call out. You hit the ball, and then...the ball then gets redirected off the guy you didn't see behind the ball, and your teammate is now not in goal cause he thought you heard his call out.

That's where normalizing your audio levels pre-production comes in handy.

So, If you are coming from my first Audio guide, and are utilizing the specific sound sources for two instances of music, There is another thing we can do using the same principal. This will be audio source 5.

###**Setting up our VOIP to output to its dedicated source**

- Go into Your chat program of choice, For this example, we will be using Discord.
- Click the Gear with the label, ""User Settings""
- Output Device will be changed to another ""unused"" device you have on hand, or one of the Virtual Audio Cables from [Here](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) If you don't have any that are sitting there not doing anything. For this Example, I will be referring to this output as ""Realtek Digital Output"" As that is what I use Channel 5 for

The reason we don't specify our Headphones here is to avoid lowering music audio from game sounds. More on that in a bit.

###**Audio Duck hunt! Ducking your Audio with OBS!**

Open up OBS and get ready to do some more audio tweaking!

- In the sources box in the main OBS screen on your Overlays scene(If you set one up as notated in Audio Mastering 101), Click the +
- Click Audio Output Device.
- Select ""Realtek Digital Output""
- Click ""Okay""
- Rename it ""Discord Audio Source"" by right-clicking ""Audio Output Capture"" and selecting ""Rename""

Now we want to set up Audio Duck Hunt! Quack! :)

- Right-click ***""Discord Audio Output""*** and select ***Filters***
- Click on the ***+*** located at the bottom left of the new window
- Select ***""Compressor""***
- Set the Threshold to ***-30 dB***(You can tweak this number if you think it is too quiet/too loud. Remember, -25 is louder than -30!)
- Drag ***Release*** all the way to the right for a value of ***1000*** to start, then lower it until it becomes unnoticeable, but you can clearly hear the person talking.
- Set the ***Sidechain/ducking*** source to the Music Track YOU hear.

*Note: You can also do the same thing for a duplicate source of your stream music on a different track, so if you like to listen to the same source as the stream, then you can lower your source when others speak WITHOUT lowering the stream output*

We need to do one last thing...

- Click ***Edit***, Located in the top left of the obs screen, and Select ***Advanced Audio Properties*** (SLOBS users must click the gear in the Audio mixer next to one of your tracks)
- Uncheck every box except ***1*** and ***5*** for the ***""Discord Audio Source""***
- Under ***""Audio Monitoring""***, Select ***Monitor and Output***

Now what this does is lower the sound of your music player ***automatically*** when someone in discord talks. Through Audio monitoring magic, we can still hear discord through our headphones assuming you set up your audio monitoring device in Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Audio Monitoring Device. Set the Device to your headphones/headset ideally.

While you are in here, ensure the ""Disable Windows audio ducking"" is checked. 

--------------------------------------------

##**Part 2 - Normalization**

OBS has a [guide](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Understanding-The-Mixer ""Thanks, WizrdCM!"") for pointers for audio levels for OBS in 21.1.0

A quick summary of the little bits of info:(I recommend reading the guide over there for some great content by our friend here on Reddit, WizrdCM)

- Microphone volume peaks in the yellow zone
- All other audio needs to be in the green zone peak values.
- No audio source should ever hit red under normal conditions. Screaming excluded from rage.(There are ways to mitigate this, however, and even eliminate. More on that later.)

How do we do this?

Well, First of all, we need to do some modifications to our microphones! Don't worry, All the modifications are done through OBS only, No hardware mods.

###**Compressors, Suppressors, and Gates**

*Wall of text, Explanation of what each of these does*

A ***compressor*** is a filter for our microphone, With help from an audio engineer here on the twitch reddit, AMV, we now have a better understanding of what it is.

The compressor in OBS Version 21.1.0 has 6 parts;

- ***Ratio***
 - The Ratio is how much compression is done do the audio source. If you had a ratio of 2:1, then for every 2dB you go over the set threshold, it reduces the dB by 1 over the level.

*Note: Microphones should have a maximum of* ***3:1*** *Ratio of compression, so adjust the value to* ***2 or 3*** *in OBS*

- ***Threshold***
 - The Threshold is the point at which the compressor starts to function. By default, the value is set to -18 dB in OBS. You will have to play with this value to achieve the best results. All recording setups are different.

- ***Attack***
 - The Attack is how fast the compressor starts to work once the minimum threshold value is detected. This means a higher ms value will cause an audible fade in dB. It is recommended to keep this value Low, but not Minimum. You will have to experiment with your setup to see what sounds best to you.

- ***Release***
 - The Release is how long the compressor runs after the minimum threshold is reached. This is used to keep the compressor in effect if you expect extended periods of loud noise.

- ***Decay***
 - The Decay is how long the audio trails off before stopping.

- ***Output Gain***
 - The Output gain is simply an amplifier of the dB value after the compressor is in effect. It is best to leave this at 0 in OBS, but feel free to experiment with it to see how it affects your audio.

*Note: You want to avoid high ratios since it will make your source sound robotic with no variation. This is known as* ***Hard Compression***


We use a ***compressor*** to avoid going over ***-20 dB***(Where the yellow starts), as anything past this point starts to distort, resulting in a loss of audio quality. Microphones are okay in the -20 to -10 dB range, however.

&gt;Gain structure is far more important. It should be averaging around the -20 point, when it changes from green to yellow. A compressor cannot fix bad audio levels, just try to smooth out small bumps.
&gt;&gt;AMV

Don't let any source to go over -20dB before compression. A Compressor is just there to smooth out the extreme peaks that the average of the source does not come near.

&gt;Think of a compressor as a helpful guy with a volume knob. Every time the signal goes above the threshold, he turns the volume knob down by as much as the ratio says he should, but only as fast as the attack setting says. If the signal gets quieter again, but still stays above the threshold he'll turn the volume up again, but only as fast as the release setting allows him to. If the signal drops below the threshold, he'll turn the volume all the way up again as fast as the decay setting says he should.
&gt;&gt;cerebellum42


A ***noise suppressor*** is just that. It suppresses the output of an audio source, Both input and output and tries to eliminate noise(such as hiss) by eliminating certain parts of the spectrum of sound. A noise suppressor has a drawback, however. By eliminating the parts of the spectrum, you are eliminating audio quality as well. A suppressor should only be used if you are unable to eliminate the source of the noise within your recording environment.

A ***noise gate*** is a ""Shutoff"" control for your microphone or other audio devices. What this does, is that it will ignore input under a certain level of sound, and above a certain level of sound. It does not, however, eliminate noise (such as hiss) within the range of transmission. It is for this reason we use a combination of a noise suppressor and noise gate in this guide.

It is also worth it to note that **the order in which the filters are on the list is important.**

If you have a gate before a suppressor, for example, the audio quality suffers a fair bit, but it is not all that detrimental. It starts to get worse when you get into the VST Plugins. More on that in a bit.

**This section is WIP, Expect more detail to go into how to normalize audio pre-production for use during streaming**

----------------------------------------


##**Setting up your Microphone(Before VST)**

The order in which these filters should be applied:

- Noise Suppression
- Noise Gate
- Gain(Optional, only use if you can't get your mic into the yellow range with windows audio mixer and audio drivers)
- Compressor(I do not recommend using OBS Compressor for your microphone. See my use for it above)
- Equalizer
- Voice Effects(Such as Robot voice, etc.)

*Equalizer? Voice effects?! I don't see those on the list!*

###**VST Plugins and You!**

OBS does not come standard with an equalizer or voice effects. These are achieved using VST 2.X+ plugins.

There are Loads of free VST plugins, several with very high-quality interfaces and effects.

I'll list the ones I use, I don't have much experience outside of these, however, as they filled my needs for audio.

- [Melda Productions MFreeFXBundle](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MFreeFXBundle)
- [REAPER reaplugs](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/)x64

Of these packages, I use the MEqualizer and MCompressor.

To add a VST plugin to obs, you must do the following:

- Download &amp; install the VST Plugin
- In OBS, right-click the gear next to an audio source. In this example, we are using our Microphone Source
- Click filters
- Click the + in the filters
- Select VST 2.x Plug-in
- Select MEqualizer from the list
- Click ""Open Plug-in interface

Welcome to my favorite equalizer.

Within the equalizer plugin window, there is a button located in the top middle with 9 squares Labeled Presets. Start here.

What you will need to do is run a lot of test recordings with a script you will recite in the same voice tone as all the other recordings(or as close as possible)

I used this script:

""This is a test recording featuring the (X) Preset. I am testing this preset in order to determine which one I like best.""

You are free to use this script, but You might be better served to google an audio script to test microphones across the whole sound spectrum.

I prefer the ""Tom Low Preset"" for my voice and microphone. I then modified the curve slightly from here to better suit my taste at this point. Feel free to tweak the settings to see how they affect your voice.

###**MCompressor**

Finally, we approach the last section of this guide; The Compressor! I use the MCompressor with the preset (Voice). Nothing else changed. I was satisfied with the result.

This is the first iteration of the guide. Please check back for changes and updates as I flesh out the guide more thoroughly.

It can also save your track history, which can be useful to find a song you liked but missed the name of.

Now how can we add this to our stream?

Well, first I recommend putting it in a folder within your OBS Library, Similar to how I have mine set up

[Filestructure](https://i.imgur.com/haAe9cv.png)

Notice that I have my stream labels folder in here as well, as well as my logo for my twitch channel. Having it here makes finding the resources much more streamlined.

Now that it is in a good Location we can start to integrate it into our OBS stream as an overlay element!

##**Snip Program Configuration**

- Start ***Snip***. 
- Located in your windows tray at the bottom right(by default), you will see a ***Blueish circle***. Right-click it.
- For this demonstration, we will be selecting ***Spotify***

Make sure the following are checked in the panel we are in.

- (Optional)***Save Album Artwork*** Only check it if you want to output the album artwork to stream. The next item in the list, Keep Spotify Album Artwork, will save the artwork to a folder in the snip folder. This minimizes internet usage, as it pulls the artwork from our copy on the pc instead of Spotify.
- ***Cache Spotify Metadata***
- ***Display Track Popup***
- (Optional)***Empty File if No track playing***, This causes more use of CPU, but will make sure no text is output to stream if no song is detected playing!
- (Optional)***Enable Hotkeys***, TBH, You may want this off, because it is more of a Set and forget kind of program.

###**Modify the Output of the text**

- Start Snip
- Right click the snip icon in the system tray located at the bottom right
- Left click ""Set Output Format""

In this window, you have 4 sections:

- Track format ($$t)
- Separator format (Blank by default)
- Artist Format($$a)
- Album Format($$l)

For example, I use:

- ♪ $$t ♪
-  ¶ 
- ♫ $$a ♫
- $$l

This text is then forwarded to the Text(GDI+) Module in OBS that has Font type, size, Direction(Horizontal/vertical) and min and max widths, as well as wrapping.

##**In OBS Configuration**

Open up OBS, and create an Overlays Scene. Trust me, You will LOVE it.

- Add a ***Text (GDI+)*** Source and name it: Now Playing, or Current song, or Whatever.
- Change the font to one of the fonts you use. I recommend a maximum of 3 different font styles across all of your overlays and logo.
- Check ***""Read from File""*** in the ***Text (GDI+)*** Properties of our ***""Now Playing""*** Text.
- For the ""Text File (UTF-8), browse to the ""snip.txt"" file. In my case, it is located here, ***""F:/Video Library/Snip/Snip.txt""***

###Now, for a Bonus treat...

- For a neat effect...Close the properties window of the ***""Now Playing"" Text (GDI+)*** Source.
- Right Click ***""Now Playing""*** And select ***""Filters""***
- Click the ***+*** located at the bottom left of the new window.
- Select ***""Scroll""***
- Set ***Horizontal Speed*** to ***75.00***
- Check ***Limit Width***, and set it to ***300-500***.
- (Optional)***Check Limit Height***, and set it to ***32***

Now your Song name, Artist, And Album name will scroll across the screen!

###**Album Art Dynamically uploaded to our stream too??!!**

You heard right. If you checked the ""Save Album Artwork"" in the section above, snip will generate small jpg files of the album art on Spotify!

To Integrate this feature into our Overlays Scene, we must first do the following.

- In ***Sources***, Click the ***+***
- Select ***""Image""***
- Browse to the ***Snip_Artwork.jpg***, In my case, ***""F:/Video Library/Snip/Snip_Artwork.jpg""***
- I recommend naming it ***""Album Art""*** or something similar to keep it easy to find later when you rework your overlay

Done! The Snip program overwrites the ***Snip_Artwork.jpg*** with the currently playing song!

-----------------------------------

##**Been there, Scene That...**

Parden the pun, but I do think you will like this next one. While we were dabbling with the Sources, did you notice in that list where the Image scene and the Text (GDI+), Scene was also there? That's Right! We can Create a separate Scene dedicated to overlays, and Output that Scene to a Source!

This is what is known as ***""Scene Nesting""***.

Why would you want to do this? Well, for one, If you stream to Youtube and Twitch, you are going to have some common Scene elements, like your webcam, or your Discord information. BUT, Followers and subscribers, as well as recent followers, alert boxes for twitch and several other neat overlay functions are mutually exclusive.

You don't want to be streaming on youtube, and have someone ""Ghost tip"" you 10,000 bits and have it announce to the stream, right(let's be real though, It'd still put a smile on your face if you did though ;))? Or maybe that new subscriber on your Youtube channel Alert box will show up on your twitch stream.

That seems silly, but It is a lot of work to go through a bunch of OBS Overlay sources in ALL of your scenes.

If you have to Separate Overlay scenes dedicated you Youtube and Twitch, you can toggle JUST once in all of your scenes, and won't forget the one that sneaks by you.

To do it is very simple:

- In a separate Scene from the Newly created ***""Overlays""*** Scene, Click the ***+*** in the sources box
- Click ***Scene***
- Select ***Overlay Scene*** in the dropdown.

And Done. A Scene Source for your Scenes.

You can also queue songs and the highest voted gets played next.

The thought occurred to me that this might be something some users would like to implement on their streams. allowing viewers to vote on the songs that should be played.

Simple implementation is for the streamer to link their Twitch account and a Spotify account to the app, app generates a unique URL for them. then post the URL for their viewers to vote on.

8affz9,Elgato Stream Deck Alternative for Android/Windows Users (GUIDE),"Hey everyone,

I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with the Elgato Stream Deck (I've seen multiple posts recently, which prompted me to make this post) and I'm sure a lot of you, like myself, would love to buy one but would rather put preference towards other stream related purchase, like lighting, sound, etc..

Anyway, I found a really cool alternative that is free and super user friendly, that communicated with OBS/XSplit (really any streaming program that you can assign key binds to scenes/sources etc), called Macro Deck.

So I made a video tutorial about a week ago and thought I'd share it here (I messaged the mods to ask if this was okay).

To clarify however, this is unfortunately only applicable to people who are on Windows and have an Android smartphone or tablet (and preferably the smartphone isn't your primary device is it's best to have it on through out the stream without worrying about incoming calls/texts etc), but, for those who meet the criteria I HIGHLY recommend this for people who want a Stream Deck alternative.

Note: I am in no way affiliated with the creator of the app!

Also, I've got some other potential tutorials lined up in the same sort of budget friendly vain, specifically a lighting based tutorial.

8a64g4,Would any other streamers like having a budget alternative to the Elgato Streamdeck? I'm working on my own control pad.,"*(This is a question, not a sales ad).*

Hi!

I am a small streamer, only 200 followers, but I've got a ton of scenes and it's hard to switch between them on my normal keyboard, cause I use most those functions in my game. (eg, numpad or function keys). or they're hard to access. 

The Elgato Streamdeck is SUPER COOL. But it's like $150. I cant afford that. And i'm not making enough money from streaming anytime soon to justify it. 

So I built myself this 25 key keypad that uses F1-F24 on it. And i've mapped them to different scenes in OBS. Also turning my cam on and off, or muting specific channels. 

## is there anyone else out there who wants something like this? 

Here's a pic of it right now: https://i.imgur.com/iLMwyTe.jpg

Here's how I use it: https://gfycat.com/SinfulThreadbareBellsnake


I'm just curious if other people want something like this. It certainly feels like it makes my streams better.

88qxoy,What is a healthy viewer-streamer relationship?,"This question has been bothering me lately, so please listen to my story.

I'm a single adult male who has a lot of expendable income and I find that I enjoy sharing my wealth with my favorite streamers. Lately I've been feeling a lot of emotion towards the streamers I regularly donate to. I love them dearly, and it almost feels like we have a real friendship. Realistically, I know these are very one-sided relationships and not actual friendships, but my emotions tell me otherwise. It feels real, and that's scary to me. At the end of the day, I don't know how they actually feel about me when they go offline. I want to be respectful and don't want to overstep any boundaries, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable by getting too emotionally attached.

My heart wants to keep giving them my love and support, because I enjoy their personalities. I truly don't expect anything in return. Knowing this, I can't help but get emotionally attached. Is this a healthy interaction for a viewer? Are people like me just trying to fill a void in their lives, or is supporting and being emotionally invested in your favorite streamers what healthy and kind people do?

Long story short, after a few weeks I got my first sub!  Other streamers have been hosting me, and it’s helped out so much. I have a few regulars now and I had a blast playing today, it was a super happy moment for me. So much so I was pretty bummed out that I had to stop. Chat was awesome, and I hadn’t laughed so hard in such a long time.

**How to use the calculator**  

* Sign in at the top right.
* Save a copy of the sheet so you can edit the values. Make sure to only alter settings in the beige cells.
* Check that the bitrate you obtain is green (Max of 6000)
* Change values to obtain a more reasonable bitrate
* Follow the guide for ""General OBS Settings"" below and enter the cyan values to update your settings (or follow the guide entirely to setup your first stream)

**Preface**  
I see a lot of people on twitch attempting to stream and not being entirely sure of the resolution, fps and bitrate they should be using for the hardware and setup they have. This calculator provides tips on what settings to use, insight on why a setting is recommended over another and spits out the recommended bitrate for the settings you choose. You will also see clearly if the settings you chose require too high a bitrate for twitch and you should change them to fit a more reasonable bitrate.

Some people attempt to stream at too high a resolution for the bitrate they are using and the games they are playing. This causes a lot of pixelation in scenes with a lot of movement and the quality of the stream would be better with a lower resolution or FPS. I even see some big streamers with (what I consider to be) unacceptable quality because they want the label of streaming at 1080p @ 60fps. You will see pretty clearly with my calculator that even with a dual PC streaming setup, 1080p @ 60fps will look horrible during scenes with a lot of movement unless you use medium x264 preset. The point of 60fps is to have more fluid movement, what's the point of the image being fluid if the image is a bunch of blockiness? The point of 1080p is to have a crisp image. Well enjoy your crisp pixelation! The two max stream settings I personally recommend for twitch streaming is 720p@60fps or 1080p@30fps for most setups (even dual PC) unless your CPU can handle medium preset without skipping frames (8 cores 16 threads or higher).

**Lower bitrate, Same Quality**  
The opposite can also be true. You may be streaming at a lower resolution and FPS but using a bitrate higher than necessary. You can lower the required bandwidth for people to watch your stream, especially as a smaller streamer with no quality options and get the same visual quality.

The bpp (bits per pixel) value I use for x264 very fast is very accurate, but for encoder options other than x264 very fast preset are rough estimates as I have not fully tested the quality. I will update this if I can obtain more information on how the presets affect the bpp required compared to the x264 very fast preset. If you use a preset other than x264 very fast, use this as an estimated recommendation. If you notice a difference in quality between 2 presets using the recommended bitrates, please do let me know so I can update this to be more accurate for other people. I could not find definitive values except for the fact that slower presets use MUCH more CPU for *some* better quality (not a 1:1 gain/loss).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/86d3g1/advanced_stream_settings_calculator_and_guide/,1521738002.0,119,0.91,86,Twitch,darkfaith93

85l1gt,"PSA: If you're waiting the invitation to affiliate and are in the middle of another Onboarding, you won't receive the affiliate invitatión","Two months ago I completed all the requirements for Affiliate (all checks, no dates or something else). I waited patiently the invitation but I didn't received anything for like a month... I submitted a ticket and after a while they replied mentioning that I didn't receive the invitation because I was supposedly in another onboarding, specifically, the [Extension Developer Onboarding](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/onboarding). I remember checking the web page when they first announced the Extensions stuff but I did nothing else after that but it seems like the onboarding was started and unfinished. You need to finish that onboarding before receiving another one. In my case i wasn't interested in develop extensions for now so I submitted a ticket to remove it, because it can't be canceled by yourself

Luckily, Twitch Support removed that onboarding and after that I received the Affiliate invitation. I'm writing here because this isn't mentioned anywhere, so check out if you are in the middle of another onboarding before waiting for affiliate.

859tdb,"Streamed for about 10 hours today with no luck, then it paid off at the end.","I streamed all day pretty much today. I recently started streaming, and really have been trying to put in the work this week. I've been very lucky and over the past couple days I've always had a few viewers and chatters! Today I was def feeling discouraged though, it was the first time I streamed all day with nobody other than my 1 IRL friend and my girlfriend stopping in to say hello while I streamed. But at the very end of the night, when I was super tired and wanted to stop streaming hours earlier, I had 5 new people come in, 2 chatters, and 3 of them followed! It def made the long night worth it and now my short-term goal of 25 followers is almost there! Super excited to stream again tomorrow. Anyone feeling discouraged just keep trying and if you got a smile on your face and keep on hanging in there, it will pay off.

84z0rg,Here's what helped me get partnered on Twitch and what worked.,"Hey everyone. I'm KilicK, used to play professional hots, been sponsored a few times, and grew a pretty decent stream I was proud of. Over the past few weeks I've completely opened up my twitter and have been answering all sorts of questions on growing your stream.  I'm going to be throwing some strategies and general guidelines I used to get partnered on Twitch. I’m not the biggest/most successful streamer out there, but I’ve been around forever and get how the twitch game works.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's what I've seen work and what's worked for me.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Have something unique, people need a good reason to watch you. Stick to one game if you can, variety is harder to get started with. Build genuine relationships with people, look at ways you can offer them value before you even think about asking for anything in return.

&amp;nbsp;

- Your stream needs to HAVE something special. Are you hella entertaining/funny/dramatic like lirik, soda, etc? Are you top 100, and have great gameplay? Are you super instructional and help your viewers improve? Are you all about community, plan events, plan your streams, have a set schedule, have special days, etc...? If you don't have that X factor, if you're not bringing in something unique, everything else I'm going to tell ya won't be nearly as effective. The simple fact is, there's thousands of streamers you're competing with, so, give people an amazing reason to watch you. If you feel like you're missing that, it's not the end of the world. Just spend some time thinking on what your strengths are. I ended up being an instructional/top 100 player with a family friendly community.

&amp;nbsp;

- Pick a game and crush it. Starting off as variety is really, really, hard. The benefits you get from sticking to one game is a ton. 

A) You can get really good at it, which people love to watch. 

B) You can really spread your roots within that game, join forums, other communities, streams, and really be involved and help make that game/community better. Which makes it easier to grow your community. It's super hard to do that when you're jumping from game to game. If you do wanna stick with variety just remember it's harder and you really need to be that entertaining/funny/dramatic kinda person.

&amp;nbsp;

- You can't just grind and stream 10 hours a day and get more viewers when you have no viewers. If you're streaming for 10 hours a day to no one, more people aren't going to magically come. You gotta hustle and build relationships with other streamers. That's why it's important to not only support each other in here but go out and make connections with other streamers. If you stick to one game you know the other streamers in your game, knowing the different communities within your game makes it easier to reach out to them.

&amp;nbsp;

- Reach out to people. Make a list of 30-40 streamers who are bigger/same size as you. Hit them up! Don't just ask for hosts, you know that shit don't work. You have to help improve their community and build a genuine relationship with them before they'll even think about helping you out. Look at all of their streams, what are they lacking? Could their designs use an upgrade? Do they have a YouTube, maybe help them get started on that? What about a website, could you help them build one? Here are some of the skills streamers really find useful that you can offer/do for them if you feel confident in your skills:

A) Graphic design work (Overlays, buttons, animations, logos)

B) Video editing work (Can be simply cutting together funny moments from their daily streams to creating complicated tutorial videos)

C) Music work (Creating beats, sound effects, or anything else they can upgrade their stream with)

D) Being a loyal viewer and eventually becoming a faithful moderator they trust that ACTUALLY moderates the chat and doesn't just sit there showing off their badge.

E) Offering them ideas for giveaways or ways to make their stream better

F) Building them a website, or blog, or offering technical services they can utilize, such as coding or creating bots for their channel

&amp;nbsp;

- Be realistic, not everyone is going to care/message you back. All it takes is building a connection with ONE bigger streamer to change everything. I got 1K followers with just one host. It’s really worth putting the time into. 

&amp;nbsp;

- It's a lot of work, but that works in your favor. Everyone wants to get big on twitch but no one wants to put in the work. If you're willing to go above and beyond for someone to build a connection, you're going to stand out, and eventually, see some traction.


&amp;nbsp;

If that wasn't enough reading for you I have a 3k+ blog post with sample emails I sent out to build a relationship with another streamer. https://streamassist.tv/how-to-become-a-twitch-partner/

&amp;nbsp;

Let me know what you think, or if you have any questions, super happy to discuss them with all of you! And would love to hear what you've been doing to work on your stream, what's working, what's not

83ueut,Why I will never talk as openly about depression again.,"This is probably one of the most conflicted messages I've ever written, so bear with me while I try to process this/share my story. Its a hard one to tell on a few levels, although I'll try to keep it short.

I have suffered from chronic depression since I was 12 (currently 32 years old). It comes and goes every few months, some cycles worse than others, some years worse than others, and over time, through therapy, medication, and just pure elongated existence, I've learned to manage it for the most part, most of the time. 

Part of what has helped me over recent years is being able to connect with other people who are also struggling, and help show them there is light ahead. There is hope, there are solutions, medication DOES help (if you get on the right stuff for you) and you can do ANYTHING in this world if you are willing to fight for it. Sometimes we all just need a bit of help with that fighting part, and that's completely normal and OK as well. 

So this said, I've always been super open with my viewers about whats going on with me. I often feel put off by it, like people will feel I'm seeking attention by being open about how I feel, which is not my intention at all, and luckily so far I've never had anyone accuse me of being a scumbag like that (I'm not, honestly). 

Recently I've been struggling pretty hard though. I sort of stepped passed my personal mental boundaries, put myself in a situation where I knew I shouldn't have due to my instability, and it ended up backfiring as expected, leaving me in a heap. As such, I haven't been streaming much these past three weeks, as I've barely been able to keep myself together using all the tools I've acquired over the years and that's left me pretty damn miserable, to put it lightly. 

Because I don't like leaving my viewers hanging, wondering what happened to me or if I'm ok, I put a message up on my channel explaining what was going on, as well as on discord, so everyone would know I am alive, working on getting better (getting back on medication, because I stupidly stopped taking it a while back thinking ""this time you'll be fine!!"" ha.) 

What happened next really shook my whole philosophy of being open. Later that night, after posting that message, I start getting calls on discord from a viewer/friend. He starts sending me very frantic messages, saying he needs to talk to me, its super important. I was not feeling like talking to anyone so I ignored the first few, until he sent me a picture of himself covered in blood, with glass stuck in his hands and messages of 'call me'. 

So I called him. He was crying his eyes out, telling me he hurt himself so he could feel my pain, he'd apparently filled his sink up with wine glasses and been punching them for a while. He told me I was important, that I mattered. That I needed to tell him I matter. That I needed to tell him how I was going to be ok or he was going to keep doing it until I believed him. So I told him of course, I will be fine. I know I will be fine anyway, I've been through depression like this before. Its not pleasant, and yes my mind does go to some dark places when I'm like this, but I've also been down this road enough times to recognize the familiar feel when those suicidal thoughts creep in to KNOW they stem only from a chemical imbalance in my brain, not due to any real world horrors that my mind creates.

I talked to him long enough to get him to go to a hospital. Talked to him the whole way there, made sure he got help. But something I'd never considered was just how my actions and words up to this point can affect someone who is more mentally unstable than I. I never considered how it made other people feel to hear someone they care about is hurting in such a way. This was obviously an extreme case, and obviously its not my fault or anything for his actions, but for the sake of protecting others who are more vulnerable than I, I don't think I will be quite as open in the future about such things. 

People always say I'm brave for talking so openly about depression; I don't think they realize it comes from a total lack of connection with the world that I feel. I tell people about my issues the same way I'd tell someone about the weather; its a factual based thing, this is who I am, also its sunny and 66 degrees today. I've come to the realization this casual approach isn't always so casual for people who are unstable, and there are likely a lot of them on twitch. 

After this experience, I honestly fear for what others might do. This guy turned out to be pretty obsessed with me it seemed. Told me he loved me, loved my streams, didn't wanna see bad things happen to me, that it hurt him when I was like this, etc. So, to avoid ever causing this sort of pain again in someone, I will limit myself from being quite as open and forthcoming about the issues I feel, for the sake of making sure others don't hurt as well. 

I realize this was a one-off case. 99.999% of people would never react this way, and never have in the past, but its important as a streamer to remember that some people really do not have the same stability as you, and to remember your words can actually cost people their lives. 

Its been 2 days since I heard from him, but just heard from him tonight. Hes going to be seeing a psychologist, he was in inpatient for the last two days being held for a psych eval, and I really hope he gets the help he needs.

I wanted to share this story mostly to pass along the message to other streamers that some people, some less stable people, really will go full on psycho fan mode, even for a smaller streamer. And being mindful of how your words can be perceived by viewers may help save a life in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/83ueut/why_i_will_never_talk_as_openly_about_depression/,1520856002.0,353,0.85,79,Twitch,cconeus
83sa6b,How can I help?,"Hey folks.

First I'll explain that when it comes to the ""gaming world"", I have no idea what I'm talking about. So apologies if I sound silly in this post! I'm also posting via mobile, so sorry for the formatting. 

My bf has been streaming for about a year on Twitch. He absolutely loves it. He still works his normal full time day job, but spends most of his free time streaming on twitch, networking on twitch, or trying to improve his channel. We have dedicated an entire room in our place to be his Twitch lab with multiple computers, screens, devices and green screen. He even watches steams on his phone and falls asleep listening every night. 

Is there anything I can do to help him be successful? I currently buy any game he mentions, so he can play it. Is there any must have equipment that I could surprise him with, that can help with the quality of his channel? Is there any community forums I can use to help promote him? Is there any other things I can do, that I haven't listed? 

He currently has a PS4 with VR bundle, PS3, Switch, SNES with an emulator, GameCube, Gameboy, 3DS and I'm sure more stuff that I'm not aware of. I know he's mentioned something about his capture card (?) getting to hot and glitchy. At least that what I think he's said. I know he likes doing stuff like randomizers, speed runs, and playing scary games.

835f13,The Truth about Twitch life for me,"Warning: Long af.

These are things that I have realized in my past 5 months of being a streamer on Twitch.
It is about myself, how I impact others, and how I somehow manage to keep going.

I am 23, I have Asperger's (high functioning autism), extreme anxiety, and depression fo' days.

Starting out in this journey, I didn't know what Twitch even was a year ago. I met someone who I fell in love with and is a partnered streamer. I watched him play for hours and hours, and continued asking questions. As the nervous nelly I am, I didn't want to be on camera, I didn't want my photo shown, and I didn't want personal information about me on the internet at all. I was literally terrified as I was rather sheltered growing up.

I continued to ask Tanner aka Kinetic (the boyfriend) about how OBS works, and how chat works, what fps means, what BR games were, and what bitrate was. He answered everything to the best of his knowledge, knowing that I had a hard time understanding why things work the way they do.

He encouraged me often to stream, and I really didn't want to yet. But I did. No cam, just a mic, and people who I had met from his stream came to cheer me on and give me advice.

I played h1z1, because I was interested. Was loving it, despite my nerves. Ended it after a few hours. Was itching to do it again, and I did. Got up to 45 followers and just stopped. I got too nervous. Way too many people. (You'd think that was a good thing right?)

Started a new account. Convinced myself that it was just a fluke. Didn't tell anyone I started a new one, just started streaming one day. Got up to 31 followers and still couldn't bring myself to stream more.

After a year long break. And some life lessons, I decided to try one more time.

I joined an organization. I met a lot of people through Tanner, I connected, I finally connected.

I am now 5 months into this account. An Affiliate. 50+ subs, almost 500 followers, 20+ daily average viewers. And I am thriving.

I finally found out what a community is. And it's my own. I found a way to connect, I use a face cam, I smile all day, I'm excited to talk to people, excited to talk to more people.

There are days when there is nobody. Just me and good ol' Nightbot. At first it hurt. I was like, where are the people who said they'd be here go? Was it me? Is it my music? My gaming? What did I do?

Then after weeks of fretting, I decided not to give a crap anymore. I was gonna have fun no matter what. I turned my music up, and focused on ranking up in Rocket League (which is now what I stream all the time)

After I decided to breathe, have fun, accept the bad days, love the good days, and smile through it all. I finally learned what it is like to live.

Through this incredible gaming community, this girl found a way to smile all day through all the hardships of daily life. 

I know probably none of you know me, nor ever will know me, and that's totally fine. Just know what if you are a streamer who is struggling, you'll get there. May take longer, may take shorter. You'll get it. Believe. Turn your music up and stop giving a shit.

If you're a viewer, you make someone feel like this. Thank you.

Love always,
Enter_Moon



----edit

Holy crap everyone... I didn't expect this kind of reaction.. This morning so many of you came to visit and give me encouragement and told me ""Good job, keep it up"" and just those words made me smile from ear to ear. I did NOT post this for attention, follows, or viewers. I only wanted to say it because I was feeling some kind of way and needed to share. I hope you all know that I appreciate everything, and I love this community even more now thanks to you.

Please, spread this love to all other streamers. The little guys are discouraged and need to be shown they're worthwhile too. YOU. ARE. WORTHWHILE. 

Never give up.

I'm looking for advice on how to handle the kind of viewers that say things like ""Hi gorgeous"", ""Hi princess"", etc... when they come onto my stream.

He says ""Hey Demonic, can you check Discord when you're done?"". I didn't think much of it and checked. This is what was written for me:

&amp;nbsp;

*""Demo dude, I've been watching your streams for a long time now and enjoy them a bunch. Playing with A, B and C (took out the names) and the community is hilarious. I have a lot of anxiety issues around talking and using voice chat online (why I didn't talk in ARMA COMMUNITY NAME  or to you for ages until i built up confidence) pretty much because I'm fucking 15 and my voice hasn't broken yet but I'm just so thankful you haven't taken the piss or anything... anyway I don't know where I'm going with this but thanks a bunch mate. And i 100% understand if you don't want to play or stream with me in it.*  
  
  
*This was probably the weirdest para I've ever sent but felt like I needed to get things off my chest.*

*Thanks for being a great streamer*


*I know its awkward so you don't have to say anything tbh
As long a you understand""*

&amp;nbsp;

I was quite taken back by the message as I never expected to get anything like this. It was a really heartwarming thing to read. I've heard stories or seen clips about how a fan of a streamer says how much the streamer's content means to them but I always thought that is something that only happens to the bigger streamers.

I could relate to the message as well, I never used voice at that age in online games in fear of being taken the piss out of and I'm happy he managed to build up his confidence in the end.

I don't know if this is an appropriate post for the sub-reddit, I thought it was just nice to show how streaming can have such an impact and positive effect on both the viewer and the streamer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/82npvy/so_i_got_an_out_of_the_blue_message_from_one_of/,1520423734.0,472,0.92,44,Twitch,RuggerMuffin

82g0iw,Its amazing to actually speak to a viewer.,"So I've actually be streaming for about 2-3 years but it was on &amp; off but I've been getting really into it since I just love the communication between people. I've tried YouTube before but it's just not as fun . I had about an hour discussion with a guy today and it was amazing and it was a first. But then he said he needed to go so I was okay with that . But I don't think ive ever been so sad after someone leaving. I just felt alone and couldn't talk to myself yet I normally can.

Any suggestions?

81ysdr,"'Largest ""Viewer Boosting"" site has been closed forcefully by Twitch! HUGE victory for Twitch!'. Has there been any confirmation of this since or was the OP lying?","About a month ago someone posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7uutel/largest_viewer_boosting_site_has_been_closed/) thread saying that the largest viewbotting site had been shut down by Twitch, and that a large streamer they looked up to came clean about having used it and had quit streaming after hearing about the site shutting down.

The lack of evidence at the time made me kinda hesitant to believe it since if Twitch were shutting down the largest viewbotting site there'd probably be news about it other than one throwaway account's word. But 1 month later the largest viewbotting site is still up (he says you can tell which one it is because it's the one multiple people have been banned for accidentally showing on stream, and I know which that is).

Also I haven't heard of any big streamers having come out as viewbotters which would be pretty big news that I think I'd hear about.

What are they you ask? Well here is the list.

1. A girl standing in the middle of a open field walking slowly toward the camera as the camera person backs up.

2. A birthday cake collapsing on itself.

3. A car following a truck on what seems to be a high way, a mattress falls out of the truck and the car swerves off the road and the camera stares at the mattress.

4. A person walking slowly into a lake.

5. A wheelchair in an empty room. This is the one with sound and it is of a baby crying.

These aren't advertising anything at all or if they are it isn't clear,  These are basically the only ads I get on mobile anymore, and I have never seen these ads on anywhere but mobile.

80lymd,Some Twitch Channel Growth Tactics to Consider!,"**DISCLAIMER!**
Everything written here is based on my own personal preference and style. To say that there is one way to grow your Twitch channel would be incorrect. My background is in digital marketing and conversion rate optimization. I’m not a full-time Twitch streamer. I’ve watched different streamers of all shapes and sizes critically for a while now and I’ve also noticed things that have clearly worked particularly well for me and my own channel growth thus far.

For me, the name of the game with *Twitch Channel Growth* is spreading your stream and your past broadcasts/highlights/clips to as many other channels across the web as possible WITHOUT spamming. That being said, let’s dive into some Twitch channel growth strategies. First and foremost…

**Contribute to your communities!** I’m part of about 14 Discord servers and I try to chime in and stay active as much as I can. I also make a point of checking out the streams and channels of everyone who follows me and expressed interest in my channel. I make sure to give advice to new streamers in Discord whenever I can, and to help others test their streams. This is a two way street guys, put in as much as you want to get back!

**Commit to a schedule (obvious)!** It’s really hard to grow without this. Every article, blog and large streamer I’ve ever talked to has always said the same thing. Committing to a schedule get’s your core viewers in a routine, and creates regulars to your stream. Make sure you have your schedule clearly outlined in your panels below, and don’t be afraid to end your stream by reminding people what your schedule is and when you’re going live next! If you miss a day, make sure you keep your viewers and your community in the loop by letting them know in advance.

**Be smart with what you choose to stream!** If you’re streaming super saturated games like PUBG and Fortnite, as a new streamer, you’re going to have a hard time growing. Why? Because you’re up against hundreds of other channels for views. Remember that in Twitch’s browse pages, streams are categorized by how many views they have at that moment. In some cases, it would take several minutes for someone to even reach the bottom of the browse page, which is where you’ll be if you’re a new streamer with a low view count.

I’m not suggesting you stop streaming these games altogether, especially if you love playing them. But, if you want channel growth, try switching to a game you still enjoy, but has less channels fighting for views.

A great tool to help you figure out what to stream is *Twitch Strike*. It’s an unofficial tool that aggregates Twitch channels and viewer data over time. It will give you super valuable insight as to which games have a higher view demand, how many channels are currently streaming the game, and what percentage of total channels own x% of total views. As a new streamer looking to grow your channel, this data is invaluable.

You can also pay to have your stream promoted on their front page when you’re live. I’ve done this for a couple months just to support the developer that built it. Surprisingly, I consistently got around 8% of my total views from Twitch Strike which is relevant if you’re just starting out.

**YouTube &amp; Social Media!** Every social media platform provides an opportunity to share your content across the web and to direct people back to your stream. It’s important to have a dedicated set of social media platforms that you regularly share content on. For me, it’s basically just Twitter and Instagram. I have a Facebook page as well, but I rarely post content on it because I see far more traffic coming to my Twitch stream from Twitter and Instagram.

If you’re comfortable telling everyone on your personal Facebook page when you go live, I say do it! Who better to support you and your streaming than friends and family. I occasionally do this, but not often because I don’t want to inundate people on my personal Facebook feed.

Also, use the Twitch *EXPORT TO YOUTUBE feature!* This is such an easy way to spread highlights and funny moments from your stream to YouTube. Don’t even worry about having to promote your YouTube channel. Just by having your content copied over to YouTube, you will become more searchable across the web. By doing this, you will also make your content more accessible for people who may have seen you passively on Twitch.

If you are planning to grow your Twitch channel, it’s important utilize YouTube, as Twitch viewers are often on Youtube just as much. *There is a good reason Twitch makes it so easy for streamers to export their highlights and past broadcasts to YouTube.* Because it directs YouTube traffic to your Twitch channel!

**Contests and giveaways** are not a must-do for all streamers (especially new ones). However, they can be a great way to connect with viewers, get people excited about your growth and to give back to your community. You don’t have to spend a bunch of money on fancy prizes either. Simple, small (even handmade) prizes often go way further than a gift card.

I often do random giveaways for the people in my stream once I hit a high point in views. It's also worth mentioning that I **rarely advertise** giveaways on social media or in my stream titles. It's been a great way for me to connect with people, make new friends and I also find it *really* fun. I only give away small little things like prints, pins, action figures, video game paraphernalia, etc (stuff that's easy to mail). I love it when people take pictures of what I mailed them and share them online. I also *ask* people to do that if it's convenient for them, and it also makes it more fun for everyone else who didn't win.

I’ve got a panel dedicated to **“Goals &amp; Giveaways”** where I will award random people in my community once I’ve hit specific follower goals. I give extra luck to viewers who are in chat more and who are more closely part of my community.

You can also rally your viewers and the people in your community, to get others involved in giveaways. You can also give people extra entries if they (for example) share your highlights, clip your streams, or get you a raid. There are lots of ways to rally your viewers to help promote your stream via the contests you’re running.

**Gleam** is a popular tool for running contests. I’ve only ever entered contests with it, but it’s a well used and trusted product.

There are so many ways of doing contests and giveaways and, if you decide to partake, you really have to find what works best for you. Like most things in life, you should also only do contests/giveaways if you enjoy doing them.

**Twitter** has been a really important part of my Twitch growth up to this point. That being said, I had a decent amount of followers on Twitter going into it, but I don’t think that’s super relevant as they were mainly digital marketing and music industry connections. Consequently, I have been slowly building more and more Twitch friends on Twitter, and those are the main people that engage with my tweets now.

**Experiment with different hashtags** on Twitter (and Instagram) for getting your channel and your content out there. Do research. This is so dependent on the type of streamer you are, the content you’re making and the type of games your playing. Different hashtags are also more relevant depending on the platform (Twitter, Instagram, etc).

I’ve had some success with #SupportSmallStreamers #Kappa #TwitchFam,m #TwitchKittens and a few others. Growth is all about testing, identifying patterns, refining and seeing what sticks.

**Obvious ProTip:** Tweet an hour or so before you go live.

Think about how you can make your tweets stand out in the vast ocean of noise. For example, I like to litter my tweets with emojis. On average, I do get more engagement with tweets I use emojis in. It’s an easy way to make your tweets stand out.

Also, use RT twitter accounts sparingly. These are Twitter accounts run by bots that just Re-Tweet tweets that mention them. There are so many! Find out which one’s work best for you and stick with those. The ones I use most are @SupStreamers @twitchraid @TwitchSharer @TwitchReTweets @TwitchTVOnline and @Vued_Retweets.

**Use engagement bots with care.** Engagement bots are essentially bots that auto-engage with content on different social media networks. They can do all sorts of different things, and they are commonly met with criticism. One simple growth hack you can try is to use Tweetfull to “like” tweets with certain keywords.

Perhaps you mainly stream a certain video game. You could try having Tweetfull “like” tweets that often use they keywords from that game. Example: if you play a lot of PUBG, you might have Tweetfull “like” tweets that mention “chicken dinner”, “PUBG”, etc.

If you had all the time in the world, this might be something you would do anyway to meet like minded people in your communities. Because we only have so much time in a day, it can sometimes be beneficial to use bots like this, however, ONLY to assist you.

**WARNING**: bot use in social media can get you banned from using entire social media platforms. If you try this tactic, do your research and due diligence before implementing!

**Clips &amp; Highlights!** These are so important for growing your channel! Clips are easier to share throughout Twitch, but can only be 60 seconds long. They are also more for your viewers to use, but you can create your own clips from past broadcasts too. Clips are also ideal for posting in your Channel Feed. Highlights can only be used by streamers and are good for summarizing and capturing funny, longer moments of your streams.

I like to create my own clips for quick funny moments and shout outs, and my own highlights for the purpose of summarizing my streams for new viewers — it’s about 50/50 for me. This is totally up to you though, and I don’t personally have a recommendation for how many clips vs highlights you should make.

**Highlights** should always be exported to your YouTube channel, with proper metadata on both platforms.

**ProTip:** after each stream, spend 15 minutes clipping and/or highlighting the top 2–3 of moments and then post them to your social media channels!

**Metadata &amp; Twitch features!** I talk about metadata and Twitch Features in my article on Channel Presentation. Both of these things are KEY to growth and should be taken seriously and always considered. The next few paragraphs are pulled right from my article on Twitch Channel Presentation.

*Most streamers don’t realize that they need to go back into their past broadcasts and highlights and add in RELEVANT METADATA like keywords and video descriptions!* This is important because you’re basically telling Twitch what your content is all about, making it easier for them to categorize you and feature you in whatever discovery algorithms they have going. This is my speculation.

Your channel’s metadata tells Twitch what kind of streamer you are, what kind of content you create, and how to categorize you. It also gets you discovered by new viewers!

**Tags!** Don’t use tags that are not directly relevant to your streams and your video content. This is asking for trouble and will screw you over in the long run. A properly tagged highlight or past broadcast will include tags related to the content and keywords that you think people may search for on Twitch. Example: if I’m streaming Super Mario Maker the tags I might use would be — “Super Mario Maker”, “Mario”, “Nintendo”, “Mario Maker”, etc.

**Your stream summary and stats** give you valuable insights into where your channel’s traffic is coming from (traffic sources), when your peak times are for views during your streams, what devices people are watching you from, which of your videos are getting the more views, and much more.

One of the most important stats to look at is Avg. views. Both the Twitch Affiliate and Twitch Partner programmes use this an important criteria for eligibility.
The name of the game with your Twitch channel stats is seeing patterns in your data so you can optimize where necessary.

E.g., if most of my views are consistently coming from mobile devices in Wisconsin, I want to make sure both my channel and stream are optimized for mobile, and my stream schedule is better suited to Wisconsin’s time zone for my peak viewing times.

This is just an example of what I might do based on seeing a consistent pattern in my Twitch channel stats. Try not to ignore them.

**Conclusion!** What have I missed? I’d really love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this section, so please comment below anything you think I may be missing or how your experience has been different.

I have a whole series of this stuff on Medium. You can find it by just searching JoMo Senpai on Medium. There is the intro and Identifying Yourself As a Streamer, Community Interaction, Equipment, Software, Tools &amp; Settings, Twitch Channel Presentation and Channel Interaction.

**This work is meant to be updated, refined and discussed critically by the Twitch community.** You can also (of course) find me on Twitch and Twitter (JoMo Senpai, everywhere!). Looking forward to continuing the conversation, and talk soon everyone!


**Edit 1:** WOW! Thanks for all the great compliments and feedback from everyone! I appreciate all the time people have taken into responding. 

**Edit 2:** Added a brief *DISCLAIMER* at the top: *To say that there is one way to grow your Twitch channel would be incorrect.* It's different for everyone and you just have to try a lot of different things and find what works best for you.

**Edit 3:** Updated the section about *CONTESTS AND GIVEAWAYS* based on all the **great** feedback from everyone. Thanks!

7zy04u,To all the small streamers out there!,"Don't give up! I've noticed this issue with a lot of smaller streamers! They stream for a short amount of time and then feel very disheartened and quit.

Streaming should not feel like a chore! You have to have fun with it. No one said it will be easy and you certainly won't have hundreds of viewers within your first few weeks.

Keep yourself engaged and stream on a consistent schedule. Truly think about your content and what brand you want to develop.

As far as content goes, think about why you think people will want to watch YOU versus someone more popular. Bring something new to the game, something original. No one wants to watch a deadpan streamer...(usually). :|

Stay motivated and have friends support you. Being positive is also very important. Try to make every single follower, viewer, subscriber entertained or feel special.

I've only been doing this for just over a month now and I'm having a blast! 

Good luck to everyone and I hope you guys have wonderful twitch careers!

7zpgdy,"What steps do you take to make yourself more secure as a streamer, to keep people from learning your address, etc.?","Hi everyone,

My friend and I recently started a podcast/Twitch talk show discussing things that new and veteran streamers need to keep in mind. On this week's episode, we are going to talk about online security/privacy.

I'd love to crowd source some ideas as the ""You don't know what you don't know"" motto really comes into play with people trying to troll/doxx you. What steps have you taken to protect yourself? Bots? ""Training"" your mods? 

We plan on discussing:

- bots that blacklist words (like addresses, phone numbers) and prevent links from non-subs/regulars
- using Twitch automod
- giving your moderators guidance in what to ban/purge
- deleting yourself from whitepages, etc

7ze0fs,AI playing FPS?,"Hello guys!

I'm a postgrad math student, and I recently focused on machine learning and deep neural networks.

I'm building an AI to play complex FPS, like CS:GO or PUBG.

Could be interesting for people to watch and play with such an AI? 

Would it be worth to stream, to raise awareness about machine learning, and maybe collect some funding for my university?

Just to be clear: It would not be a cheating AI, but a neural agent that will play repetitively to get better, using only the video output as its feedback, while streaming its behavior on twitch.

7z80h5,My dad thinks im an internet cam babe?...,"But i am a dude...

How do you explain streaming to those who dont know? 

I thought this topic might bring some entertaining stories, like the one i will share with you now.... 

Once upon a time, while enjoying a dinner with the family, the topic of ""Hobbies"" was brought up... Immediately the cold sweats began pouring as i knew i would have to yet again explain to someone my recent escapades in the world of Twitch streaming. Once my turn came around i did the usual dance of ""Its kind of like YouTube but live"" and the ever famous ""Yes people actually watch other people play video games live""... 

While my younger siblings understood and were familiar with the platform, my dad had a somewhat flabbergasted look on his 65 year old, ""I just got my first smartphone"" face....

After further explaining how the medium works, Pops seemed satisfied with the answer and the night carried on... 

Fast forward to the next day, while in hot pursuit of the nearest Burger King i received a phone call from my father who very obviously has something of severity to talk about... 

Dad than proceeded to explain to me how he doesn't think my newfound path as, and i quote, ""An internet porn man"" is the right choice and that while it is ""A relief that men can be cam girls too"" i should pursue other avenues....

After almost taking out a somewhat obtuse woman at a bus stop with my truck from laughing so much, I explained the situation to my embarrassed father and he now understands

......... I hope.

7y0iq7,"When you start streaming, make time to visit other communities","Since starting streaming over a year ago, I've noticed a few regulars getting into streaming and disappearing, never to be seen again. I was talking to one IRL and they said they never have time to watch streams because they're too busy streaming themselves.
I don't think I can stress enough how important it is to watch other streams and be part of other people's communities. Not only will you make friendships and connections (maybe get thrown a host every now and again) but you can learn so much from them (or steal ideas like I do). One thing I recommend streamers do is set yourself a schedule so you're not just streaming whenever you're free and make time to watch other people. 

I hope I don't sound preachy but I was guilty of it at the start and as someone who watched a lot of Twitch before I had a powerful enough PC to stream, a lot of people I'd built close bonds with started to disappear.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not worried about my viewers leaving, but it really rubs me as disrespectful. This is not something you're saying casually.

7x39pc,"1upCoin.com - Accept cryptocurrencies easily, securely and free on your stream with alerts!","Hey /r/twitch, I recently created and launched a new service on January 1st, called https://1upcoin.com/. It's a free service that makes accepting cryptocurrencies on your stream easy and secure, and requires no prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to setup! 

&amp;nbsp;

One of the biggest benefits of accepting cryptocurrencies is that users are unable to do any sort of chargebacks. Cryptocurrencies have this protection built in and based on some of the posts in this sub alone, this should be a huge reason to start accepting cryptocurrencies today. Additionally donations in cryptocurrencies can be anonymous, so you won't have to worry about some of your details that sometimes get shared by PayPal getting out there. Finally with cryptocurrencies becoming more popular this is a great way to introduce yourself with cryptocurrencies!

&amp;nbsp;

As I mentioned, setup is easy, but it's also quick! Most users have been able to start accepting cryptocurrencies in less than 1 minute! Go on over to https://1upcoin.com/ and log in with Twitch or YouTube, you'll be brought to your main dashboard page. The next step is to connect Stream Labs or Stream Elements for your alert system. Stream Labs makes this next step a lot easier, but Stream Elements isn't too bad either. Additional alert platform support and options are coming. If you have any that you'd like to see supported first, please let me know in the comments!

&amp;nbsp;

Once you have your alert platform linked you'll have to link your Coinbase account. If you're brand new to cryptcurrencies then you might not have an account on Coinbase yet. Setup for Coinbase is easy and free, I have a handy video for you to watch if you need any help with the setup, [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv-9bFzi3k0). 

&amp;nbsp;

After you created your account, linking it to 1upCoin is as easy as the previous steps! Now whenever you receive a cryptocurrency donation, you will receive it on your Coinbase account and our service will trigger an alert on your stream! Once you receive the donation you can choose to either keep it there in the form that it was donated or to cash out to real money. Also 100% of the donations that are sent, go directly to your Coinbase!

&amp;nbsp;

To see our service in action, I've included some of my favorite clips of users receiving donations. Overall we helped streamers get over $10,000 in USD in the last month!

* https://clips.twitch.tv/EncouragingSmoothChickpeaArgieB8
* https://clips.twitch.tv/DependableUglyWatermelonVoteYea
* https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpartialEmpathicDiamondSeemsGood 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, if you're just a viewer and you're interested in having your favorite streamers accept cryptocurrencies, we have a referral system setup where you can get $100 in Litecoin! Just sign up and goto your referrals page to get your unique link!

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I understand the need for other cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Bcash being supported. I'm currently running a beta that allows additional coins, including DOGE so if you're interested in helping test those, let me know!

&amp;nbsp;

If you have any questions/comments/concerns feel free to post them below, also be sure to check out https://1upcoin.com/faq and https://www.twitch.tv/videos/227828459?t=00h52m27s or reach out to me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jaku)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaku)! Thanks!

I've had an 18 second ad of footage of a hill, no products or voices or text. Just a video of a hill for 18 seconds with some wind blowing. I've had 2 minute long ads of people having a conversations, always in languages I don't understand, with no subtitles or any obvious products or services being shown. I've had ads of just...facts being said? Like a graph of our population growth over time? I've also had what I can only describe as a low-budget How It's Made excerpt, with really grainy film and a hard to understand narrator.

7vpqmh,Where to find no copyright twitch background music... And why you can't always trust soundcloud,"I recently learned that not all song on SoundCloud that claim to be cc-by (aka free to use if you include attribution) are actually free to use. The majority of the time it is a remix from an artist who never had the right to remix the song in the first place. Ugh.  

Thus I've set up a system to upload each song to youtube (because of their automated copyright check – the song is processed and checked for copyright the instant you upload it) so I know if it is good to go to stream on Twitch. I've found that the majority of remixes get flagged, but small artists who upload as cc-by are normally telling the truth because they aren't claimed by YouTubes automated copyright system. I delete any song that gets a copyright claim (unless it is cleared later, but I still put a warning in the description). So far I've been able to check and clear ~500 songs for streaming on Twitch. 



Long story short!

Here are a bunch of playlists that I've pre-checked to make sure they don't get any copyright claims on them. They are all good to go for streaming on twitch.

7vagzp,A Growth Hacker’s Guide to Growing Your Twitch Channel In 2018 (Part 4/6)!,"**Disclaimer**

Everything written here is based on my own personal preference and style. To say that there is one way to grow your Twitch channel would be incorrect. My background is in digital marketing and conversion rate optimization. I’m not a full-time Twitch streamer. I’ve watched different streamers of all shapes and sizes critically for a while now and I’ve also noticed things that have clearly worked particularly well for me and my own channel growth thus far.

I wrote a 6-part series on Twitch channel growth called ""A Growth Hacker’s Guide to Growing Your Twitch Channel In 2018"" and I think part 4 is relevant (especially around your channel's metadata)!

**Let's get into it!**

Think of your Twitch Channel like a physical store. Things like your stream title and thumbnail are your display window to generate interest from each passerby.

The first thing is getting people to come in. Once they are in, everything from the look of your stream, panels, bio, schedule, and the story you create is what will help someone decide whether or not they want to interact or follow you.

When they're in, most people want to know who you are and what you’re all about. Make sure that you have panels that talks a bit about who you are. I feel much more connected to a channel when I know, even just a little bit, about the person I’m watching.

Who are you, what is your story, what are you all about and why should I watch you?

These are the questions your brand and story should answer. You should also be thinking about how you can maximize every bit of real-estate on your Twitch channel to make you and your brand stand out.

**Panels**

Can be a great way to differentiate yourself from other streamers, and also make you and your channel look more interesting to follow. Think about how you can make yours look unique and interesting.

**Stream titles**

Stream titles are super important for attracting viewers from Twitch’s browse section. Have you ever stumbled upon a stream in the browse section of Twitch? Why were you attracted by it, what interested you about the stream title and the thumbnail?

**Here are a few ways to make your stream titles better:**

**Use emojis**: This is such a simple way to make your stream titles stand out in the vast oceans of streamers out there. I actually tested this, and I found (on avg.) I had about 15–20% more unique viewers come into my stream from the Browse section than when I did not use emojis in my stream titles. Aesthetic preferences aside, this works to help your title stand out in an ocean of text.

**Meme jacking**: Do any of the games you’re playing have any wildly popular jokes/memes/culture references associated with them? If so, try to weave them into your stream titles. This will give people a direct, familiar reference and will make people more comfortable choosing your stream over someone else’s.
Spelling and grammar: You can use CAPS if you want to, but try to use proper grammar/spelling. People are more sophisticated than you may think, and it will turn off a lot of potential viewers if you have poor spelling and grammar. I always have one or two people look over my stream titles quickly before going live.

**Branding**: Is there anything consistent you can have in all your stream titles? You have a better chance at popping out in the browse categories if there is some consistency that people might see over time. For me, I always include “SENPAI plays…” somewhere in the title.

**Update your category**: Imagine walking into a pizza joint only to find they’re serving spaghetti and meatballs. Still awesome, but not really what you signed up for. If you switch between games during the same stream, PLEASE update this in in your stream title and category selection! This is such a common mistake I see streamers make. If someone finds you through browsing streams for a specific game, and they go into your stream to find you are playing something else, you are offering something they weren’t looking for in the first place and will leave. ALWAYS make sure your storefront (stream category/game) properly reflects what you’re offering!

**DON’T**
Don’t include anything in your stream title that YOU, YOURSELF wouldn’t care about if you saw it in someone else’s stream title. Example: do you care when a streamer you’ve never heard of is trying to reach a certain follower goal? I don’t, and you probably don’t either.

If you want to rally your current viewers, just say so during your stream! Your stream title should be optimized for enticing NEW VIEWERS to check you out.

Don’t put too much flare in your titles. Example: [ENG], [PARTNER], [SUB GOAL: 50], [TALKS TO VIEWERS], [AFFILIATE], etc. In my opinion, these are things that you shouldn’t be trying to convince people of in your stream title; it looks clunky. Talk the talk when/if people decide to chime in during your stream. The things you want to communicate in your flare will be obvious soon enough.

Don’t misrepresent your streams in the stream title. Be direct, and give people a good sense of what they’re getting themselves into.

**Twitch Channel Feed**

It’s important to use all of the features Twitch provides, especially your Channel Feed. Why? Because it makes you and your channel more discoverable.

What you post in your Channel Feed shows up in other people’s home pages and is not only relevant for engagement but keeping you top of mind as a streamer that people enjoy!

I will always make clips and highlights from past broadcasts and post at least one update in my channel feed every day.

**Metadata: more people should talk about this!**

In this context, metadata refers to all the information that describes and gives context to your past broadcasts, highlights and vods/videos. The metadata Twitch allows its users to control is the thumbnail, title, game/category, description, language, tags, and what collections your videos may fall under. Here is why this is all super important, especially to small streamers and growing channels.

Most streamers don’t realize that they need to go back into their past broadcasts and highlights and add in relevant metadata like keywords and video descriptions. This is important because you’re basically telling Twitch what your content is all about, making it easier for them to categorize you and feature you in whatever discovery algorithms they have going.

Your channel’s metadata tells Twitch what kind of streamer you are, what kind of content you create, and how to categorize you. It also gets you discovered by new viewers!

Discovery algorithms tend to favor metadata with keyword stacks and layers of similarity. This is why it’s important to categorize all your content into Collections; another Twitch feature. Twitch only lets you categorize your highlights and past broadcasts. You can include relevant keywords and info in your collection titles and descriptions! Think about how it all works together.

Video Tags! Don’t use tags that are not directly relevant to your streams and your video content. This is asking for trouble and will undermine you in the long run. A properly tagged highlight or past broadcast will include tags related to the content and keywords that you think people may search for on Twitch. Example: if I’m streaming Super Mario Maker the tags I might use would be — “Super Mario Maker”, “Mario”, “Nintendo”, “Mario Maker”, etc.

7uutel,"Largest ""Viewer Boosting"" site has been closed forcefully by Twitch! HUGE victory for Twitch!","Hey guys,

Sorry I am posting this on a ""throw away"" account. I obtained this information from someone I looked up to: Always had tons of viewers, tons of support, etc. but with the closing of this service he decided to quit and come clean instead of get caught otherwise. Possibly, you guys will get the information on him later on (~2k viewers average, lots of 100k+ clips, etc.) but for now I will keep his name out of it and mine as I don't want to be affiliated to this stuff in any way. Really sad and devastated that the person I looked up to was boosting for years now.. Goes to show what Twitch has come to :/

------

**The biggest site for ""viewer boosting"" has now officially closed it's doors.**

Twitch has been pushing their lawsuit against them and plenty of other sites for about 7 months now (since June). They finally got to the point where they couldn't get away from Twitch/Amazon's lawyers and forcefully had to close their doors. Every other site on the lawsuit had closed their doors basically as soon as the suit came out but these guys continued. All sites on the lawsuit don't provide these services anymore. A true victory for Twitch!

Not sure if they will stop providing viewers instantly or if they will stop once people's services run out (to avoid charge backs I assume; their control panel still works from what he states) but we should start seeing A LOT of streams losing massive amounts of average viewers soon. 

- This is the site that got a lot of streamers banned because they showed it on stream, you should know which one it is by just this info.

Thought I would share this information as it is pretty damn dope in my eyes. Hopefully you guys think so as well.

7uskji,"TIP- if you stream off the xbox app, always check your game.","This might sound ridiculous but I just streamed 3 hours under ""call of duty (R symbol I don't have in my phone) : ww2 instead of just call of duty: ww2. I know that might be confusing, but because of that one symbol I did not show up in the directory. 
Another example would have been sea of thieves beta. Everyone streamed the game under sea of thieves, however, if you don't have a pc yet like me, the game automatically set itself to sea of thieves beta which isn't availible under the twitch directory.

Basically, there is literally 0 chance someone will see your stream unless they already follow you. There is no room for growth because you will not be on the directory. Nobody will know you exist.

7ubahn,Advice/Motivation: PATIENCE,"

Everyone want's instant growth. They expect to earn $100 a day, gain 200 followers in a week, become the best streamer on Twitch. When, in reality, it's never going to happen. Everyone lives for the now, they want a Lamborghini right now, but they don't want to work/grind for their Lamborghini. They want 100,000 followers right now. In reality, it'll take you 3-6 years to make that happen IF you GRIND your ass off.

Seriously, everyone reading this if you don't know who Gary is, go look him up right now. You won't regret it.

Give me a reason why you'll be the next superstar streamer. What's so special about you? Great, you work hard, you're charismatic and funny. But, how long do you think it'll take to reach your goal. Be honest with yourself. Do it, don't say, oh maybe 3 years. No, add 5 to that... Now what do you think about all that hard work? Whenever you make a goal, realize it's going to take much longer than you expect. Then tell yourself, are you able to put in 8-12 hours a day, everyday, weekends to, to reach that goal? No, then go back to complaining and making excuses. I'm not writing this as your friend, this is life. Patience, patience, patience. You may be the hardest worker in the world, but if you're not patient enough, tough luck, you've lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7ubahn/advicemotivation_patience/,1517417626.0,73,0.72,89,Twitch,StreamersTele
7u1o7a,"Reminder to put ""no refunds"" on your Donation panel.","So TL;DR this happened yesterday (WARNING: language):

https://twitter.com/i0ki_LoL/status/958330485884768256

Long version of the story:  I streamed a game with a player that was unhappy with my performance in the game, despite us winning it.  He came to my stream after the game and harassed me (truth be told we were shit talking each other), I then said enough is enough and banned him from my stream.  Within 1 minute he donates, continuing the stream of shit talk and I basically say ""thanks for the money"" and ignore his comment.  

I move on with my stream, and what a surprise, the guy filed a chargeback.  I've had a little amount of chargebacks in the past, so I knew exactly how to handle myself.  I did all of the following, and recommend you do too:

- downloaded the VOD
- screencap'd the chatlog
- screencap'd the PayPal receipt
- screencap'd the StreamAlerts donation

And wrote out a 4 paragraph message to him letting him know I would be escalating it, documenting every single thing that happened and showing him that I had proof.  The chargeback claimed that he ""did not receive the service he ordered"".  I included a screencap of **my donation panel explicitly stating that all donations are just that: donations, and are not refundable.  (This is the important part you should take away from this thread.)**

Long story short -- I woke up to my $3.00 safely nestled in my PayPal account.  It felt good to win against a jackass trying to abuse the system.  The guy was so desperate for my attention that he spent money to try to get the last word in, thinking he could further inconvenience me with a chargeback.  Guess he underestimated the lengths I would go to! :) 

It wasn't about the $3.00 at that point, it was about not letting him take advantage of the way the streamer/viewer relationship works.  

**Remember to make it explicitly clear in your Donation panel that all donations are final, and do not promise you any service or product in return!**

EDIT: Formatting.

EDIT2: It's more important that you keep all of the evidence (as I did) than it is to put ""no refunds"" in the panel.  Stay safe streamers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/7u1o7a/reminder_to_put_no_refunds_on_your_donation_panel/,1517325356.0,538,0.87,109,Twitch,i0ki

3 days ago I got a notification that a streamer named ""thefyzu"" had come online. Seems to be some random Russian PUBG guy.

I also noticed a lot of other random people followed him 16-17hrs earlier that clearly spoke English and probably would not follow a random guy streaming in Russian.
