o0me1f,The Obesity Epidemic is the biggest problem in the industrialized world right now.,"If fat is beautiful, then so is lung cancer. You don't get to pick one.

It's extremely popular to downplay the obesity epidemic when most people we know are obese. They think that, since they're mom's obese, that they have to constantly justify it as ""not being that bad"". Go right now, and look at the statistics. It almost doesn't matter what country you live in.

In 2014, the obese population outnumbered the underweight population.

And when you go outside and struggle to see somebody who's actually in shape, it's a *massive* fucking problem. A *huge* fucking problem.

In fact, it is the single biggest problem right now, and it's getting tiring watching ""fat acceptance"" and fast-food advertising, and driving home and having to wait because the fucking McDonalds drive-thru extends onto the road.

In the '90's we started cracking down on smoking because it was a public health issue. When will they crack down on fast food and realize that it doesn't just affect themselves, it affects their kids and their families?

Except, this is even worse than smoking. Hands down.

And it's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. I don't know how people justify the current state of the world when most people they love are in extremely poor physical health.

And there are groups of people who make fun of those who exercise. Think of the ""sports bro"" stereotype. People actually avoid people who do sports because they think they're ""assholes"". I bet there's more psychologically to that though, I bet it's hard for someone who is obese to spend time with people who exercise. It will constantly challenge the lifestyle they've picked for themselves, so they protect their ego: ""Who needs to exercise in 2021? It's not caveman days anymore lol!""

And maybe they justify themselves by saying they are focusing on their mind as opposed to their body. Well, your mind is your body. Healthy body = healthy mind. Don't pick one over the other, unless you focus on both, your not doing it right. And you won't fix your mental health issues.

The state of denial, the profit-driven adverts, the downplaying, the acceptance, everything.

It's been the saddest thing to watch. Because I've been watching it and hearing about it all my life. And it's only gotten worse. WAY WAY WAY WORSE.

Some might say the environmental damage right now is a bigger problem than the obesity epidemic. And I'm not going to downplay either, but I don't believe we can save the environment while most people are eating the plastic foods that litter it. And that's why the obesity epidemic is more important than the environmental one right now. Save yourselves, save the environment.

*every* man in that cast beleived us. All the guys formed a system to keep each other safe, we made sure we were never alone with him, etc. 

But *none* of the girls believed us exept for one, and that was only because she was dating one of the guys and the 21 year old told her how he wanted to have sex with her boyfriend and that she was just ""an obstacle"". When I told the other girls, they shamed me for gossiping, claimed he seemed just fine, etc. 

And this man, at 23, continues to do shows with children because our female director didn't beleive any of us either. 

There has never, ever been a time where my male friends made fun of me for being harrased, or didn't beleive me.

lxapd5,"The reason that ""gender stereotypes"" are so common in TV shows, movies and other popular media is that they're generally accurate.","A lot of feminists like to complain that entertainment media has too many stereotypical male and female characters and even go as far as to blame it for alleged societal sexism. In fact, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority even introduced a rule in 2018 that bans ads that use ""gender stereotypes"". Four ads have since been banned under it. I had a look at all of them and they were pretty tame, I couldn't wrap my head around anyone genuinely taking issue with any of them. All of this misses something important.

The use of such ""stereotypes"" in entertainment media doesn't condition society, it reflects it. Whether feminists are willing to admit it or not, gender does have a significant impact on personality. There's been research upon research showing average personality differences between men and women, and anyone who lives in reality and isn't in denial can tell the men/boys and women/girls around them generally don't behave in the same way. This is why ""gender stereotypes"" are often used in media whether it be as a comedic device or just part of the characters' personalities. It helps make it funny and/or relatable by reflecting/caricaturing what real people tend to be like. We can argue all day if it's because of nature or socialisation, but it's a real thing regardless of where it comes from.

Also, I put the word ""stereotypes"" in quotes because I'm not even sure it's the right word here. Racial stereotypes for example tend to be based on a lack of experience with other races, ""gender stereotypes"" on the other hand tend to be based on experience with the two genders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/lxapd5/the_reason_that_gender_stereotypes_are_so_common/,1614825630.0,198,0.9,38,TrueUnpopularOpinion,theinspector5
lx0841,"Cancelling Dr. Seuss is no benign development, it's part of a cultural movement on the left and it's not slowing down any time soon. They continually moving to greater and greater thought control","First of all I am not claiming this is a centrally planned operation being coordinated by a few elites in some smoke filled dark room. Reddit easily tolerates the idea of Republicans propagandizing, pushing and pulling culture in general movements all the time. But if you try to say the same of the left people call you a conspiracy theorist. And of course, all criticism toward the left is dismissed as either evil or insane.
    
Second of all, I realize 6 specific books are being pulled from print. But again, this is a part of general movements. We don't have to have cartoonish examples of exaggerated happenings in order to comment on trends within culture. Check out Washington Post's Ashley Parkers timely complaints on the books being ""too long"" and ""annoying"". The journos and corporate press are descending on this cherished property, piling on
      
https://twitter.com/AshleyRParker/status/1366818692361773057
     
""The left"" I'm referring to is the identity politics obsessed, socialist/communist sympathizing field of journalists, corporate marketing depts and liberal university students/faculty + the allied Democratic state. This alliance makes a rather powerful force to shape culture, with the state and corporations working together as best as they can. Not always a perfect marriage, but the alliance is obvious.
      
Anyway, why Dr. Seuss? It's part of destroying any ""old"" culture so it can be replaced with new programming. The fact one could read 10 Dr. Seuss books and find no trace of Marxism or identity politics makes the whole franchise unacceptable. This is a slower, more drawn out version of book burning. They cant be that drastic to outright burn books, so they slowly ""cancel"" non-conformist media over the years.
  
Also, It won't be *all* old media, again it's not so drastic. Rather popular old media will be reassessed here and there, discarded if it cannot be reinvented as woke, in order to set the general trend and signal to what is permissible. Eventually people will learn to select leftist ""permissible"" media on their own. They can fill in the gaps so not every single piece has to be cancelled individually.
  
The left wants total thought control. From the fundamentals of language itself to all manner of cultural expressions. They're digging their claws into every area of reality they can. It's a movement, not a conspiracy. I'd argue it's natural and has many precursors through history. I don't think the ""the left"" is the first or will be the last group of humans to become greedy in their control of humanity. It's a shitty thing humans tend to do.

lwzkwj,"As a black woman, we don't want to be viewed as strong.","I hate this narrative of black women being viewed as stronger or more durable than other groups of women. Most black women don't like this narrative, either, but they embrace it because it's one of the only positive stereotypes we have. And it's rarely ever even viewed as a positive trait. It's used to portray us as intractable and masculine. This ""strong black woman who don't need no man"" business is almost always used to mock us.

Some of you are going to say black women started this, that we say it all the time. It doesn't come from us. The concept that black women are tougher than other groups of women comes from slavery. It was a way to justify working us so hard, despite us being women. Sojourner Truth even addressed this in her ""Ain't I a Woman?"" Speech. 

This has modern day consequences. Did you know black girls, [starting at age 5](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/research-confirms-that-black-girls-feel-the-sting-of-adultification-bias-identified-in-earlier-georgetown-law-study/), are viewed as ""less innocent"", less deserving of nurturing, and ""more likely to have sexual knowledge"", compared to their white peers of the same age? 

This bullshit starts at five years old and proceeds until we die. That's fucked. 

[Did you know 40% of all sex trafficked women are black?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.cbcfinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SexTraffickingReport3.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6yurq0pTvAhU5FFkFHRFbCg4QFjABegQIAhAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TJLVTBKxd_ekhncXVQX4v)? We are 7% of the population. 7. Percent. Not to mention, this disparity gets larger the younger the victims are. 

Did you know traffickers prefer to traffic black women, not because of any especially high demand, but because they (correctly) assume that the penalties for being caught won't be as high? And that the cops don't care as much about them? [Well, now you know.](https://humantraffickingsearch.org/human-trafficking-not-all-black-or-white/)

This carries into adulthood as well, with Black women not being believed when they say they are in pain, which is at least partly responsible for the gigantic disparity in maternity deaths. Black women are [twice as likely to die when birthing a child](https://www.ajmc.com/view/racial-disparities-persist-in-maternal-morbidity-mortality-and-infant-health). That's insane.

lsxh8l,"'Hate crime' legislation is unconstitutional because it creates special classes of people whom are more protected from the law than others. There is no such thing as a 'hate crime', only crime. All crime is wrong and should be punished the same.","There is no such thing as a ""hate crime"". No one can know what is in someone else's head or heart. Blurting out a racially insensitive word doesn't mean someone is filled with hate, or necessarily even reveal their motivation in said crime. 

When governments enact ""hate crime"" legislation they create two classes of people:

1. People who are now subject to more strict criminal penalties because of nongermane extraneous reasons.

2. People who have EXTRA protection under the law, also because of nongermane extraneous reasons. 

The idea that a person who assaults another person should be punished less than the person who assaults another person in the same way while yelling some racially insensitive remarks is an egregious miscarriage of the concept of equality before the law.

**Put another way:**

&gt;My point is that this system means that administration of Justice is different for the same crime, based only on inferred socio-political beliefs. 

&gt;Person A punches an asian woman in the face because she's asian. 

&gt;Person B punches an asian woman in the face because they felt like it. 

&gt;Person A shouldn't be punished more than Person B, and Person B shouldn't be punished less for their crime just because it didn't have a perceived socio-political component.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: It creates two classes of people: those who get extra protections and rights under the law, and those who receive more punishment during the administration of Justice than others because of **inferred socio-political beliefs**. This is not blind Justice.

This entire website dosen't even bother attempting to listen to the anti-lockdown argument. They blindly attack you and immediately condemn you because you don't support lockdowns, never mind the fact that their crippling our economy and running our country into the ground. My biggest issue with the pro-lockdown community is that they never seem to have an end goal in sight. JUST HOW LONG are we supposed to put up with lockdowns? WHEN can people FINALLY get back to work and feed their families? WHEN can we finally just enjoy our lives again? The pro-lockdown fanatics on reddit seem to want us to live like this forever. Yes, I know keep granny safe. But do you really think granny, who's probably not gonna live but another decade anyway is gonna enjoy spending her final years trapped all alone in her house completely isolated from everyone she loves? Living out the rest of her life miserable? Our economy is falling apart. We can't afford to sit on pause for eternity. I'm convinced the only reason reddit is so fanatical about lockdowns is because 1. The website is a far left echo chamber that treats anything the left (who are the ones in support of lockdowns) like religious text and blindly support it because the other side MUST be wrong on every issue and if you support the other side you MUST be an evil anti-mask deplorable scum. 2. Reddit wants to feel smart and self righteous and wants something to feel superior to. They think that by being pro-lockdown and panicking about covid that it  makes them somehow on the side of ""science"" and ""logic"" even though they are completely illogical towards how long they want these lockdowns to go on. 3. Most of them are teenagers and college students who don't understand that some people can't go 8 months unemployed because some people actually have JOBS they need to work in or desperately are looking for one. And NO. Not everyone can just ""work from home"". Oh, and Don't even get me started on the ""introverts"" who were celebrating the lockdowns while relishing in  the pain of extroverts who were unhappy about it.

lrg30u,Science has been pervaded by money and special interests. Whereas once i embraced scientific endeavors I now approach every claim and study with extreme skepticism.,"Science used to be the pinnacle of human achievement in my opinion. However, even hard sciences have been perverted and/or corrupted by wishy washy bullshit. 

Today money and special interests control a good portion of the funding that goes to scientific research. Researchers at universities operate under the de-facto unspoken expectation that their research will ultimately conform to societal expectations and ""advance"" (aka, not contradict) ""well-settled science"". 

This goes against everything that science once stood for. When I was a child we learned about the scientific method and how important it was to adhere strictly to it. The scientific method essentially does not exist anymore if the results of a study are whitewashed for social or ""equity"" reasons, or if they happen to go against a specific political or scientific narrative that generates enormous ""points"" (points can be money, power, achievement, awards, recognition, notoriety, or any combination thereof) for lots of now-powerful people. 

I'm not just talking about the fantastic claims in MSM headlines about science. I am talking about the actual science and the actual researchers performing it and writing the studies.

If I had to change my name from Wang Li to Timothy Li to get a job, that's bad, but changing some aspects isn't always bad and 'white washing'. For example, if my dialect uses ain't but I had to change it to get more interviews, it isn't 'washing' yourself. You are changing your language to a common one so people can understand you. I honestly don't see a problem, and I don't think the country has to cater to your dialect or accent. For example, if a company doesn't hire a British speaker for their customer service job, I don't think it's bad discrimination. The clients are Canadian English speakers, maybe the company thinks for ease of communication they hire someone with a more understandable accent. 

For example, if your culture is relaxed and casual and wears jeans, we'll say the country is a made up country in the Middle East. However, there is an event that requires suit and tie and no jeans allowed, it isn't discrimination, it isn't 'give up your heritage'. You can keep your heritage at home. Work is work. And there really isn't any need to 'celebrate your heritage'. Sure, you can if you want, but I don't think it's white washing to ask people to have uniform. I mean, if you want to argue about uniformity and corporate environment being toxic and all, sure. But that's not an issue of race.

On the flip, people should get mad if, say, a German moves to Indonesia and starts behaving like the rest of them. Such as celebrating the celebration even if it's religious and not their religion.

lb1n9q,"""person of colour"" is a stupid term.","People who use 'person of colour' can't even decide who counts as a 'person of colour'. Kim Kardashian is roughly the same shade as Mariah Carey. And sure, Kim Kardashian probably used a spray tan, but some people tan naturally. There are people whom some will call white that tan to the same shade as Mariah Carey. If it's not about skin tone, then what is it about? 

Lets say we agree Barack Obama is black and he has a kid with someone whom we agree is white. Then the kids will be half black half white. So now what if this kid has a kid with someone that is agreed as white. At what point does the descendant become white? I think that's the problem with terms like this. No one can agree. 

If 'colour' is an experience thing, then if I as an asian immigrant adopt a kid who is neither asian nor immigrant, then they are allowed to enjoy my culture and thus have no such thing as 'white privilege'. Then my white baby suddenly becomes a 'person of colour' since i adopted such baby. 

For me, I think white, black etc is fine to describe things in general. the same with tall, short.

However I keep seeing them being treated by shit by these 'inclusive', lgbt, feminist types. Who ironically try to champion the flag of inclusivity and tolerance. And I mean they treat them like shit, I know a christian guy in my college who gets very discriminated against and they tell him its because he's a christian and pro life. Meanwhile all my college does is email everyone their new lgbt trans pro women guidelines. Which is weird because I go to film school and the majority of the students fit in that mold, so who the fuck is discriminating them for that, I don't know.

And they don't give the same shitty treatment to muslims or jews or any other religions. Its just christianism. It's insane. Muslim treatment of their kind is way worse. They also support leftist icons like che guevara who'd straight up execute homosexuals.

Most christians I've met are really simple low profile people and they are a minority.

If my dad came up to me and said ""The moon landing is fake, the Earth is flat,"" I would ask for compelling evidence, hear him out, and then decide if it's logical or not. If it's not logical, I respectfully disagree and avoid the topic to bring up further conflict.

You don't need a support group for this. My mind is literally running into a brick wall even attempting to understand the logic here. There is only one way this can exist without being satire; if Q is real and the deep state set it up to further the anti-Q narrative to deter from their sins. I'm not saying that's the case but I want to believe it because I refuse to believe humans have weakened down to the point where they need a support group for a family member or friend believing in a conspiracy.

jukzjk,"AskReddit shouldn't have removed the ""ask a r*pist"" thread back in 2012","For those who don't know about this, back in mid-2012, on AskReddit, there was a thread that was essentially ""ask a r\*pist"". Many r\*pists shared their stories, and there was a lot of very interesting discussion on it. Sadly, however, the entire thread and all the comments in it got entirely nuked, which was a major loss.

Yes, I know it's a horrible thing that can be triggering to many, but still, it was a rare chance for honest discussion of a taboo topic. They should have just removed any comments that encouraged r\*pe, and left the thread alone.

* The thread was used for research in multiple studies
* The thread gave a rare opportunity to hear the other side of the story

Then some psychiatrist made a thread calling it dangerous, based on what he admitted were theories that had never been tested, despite the fact that many r\*pe victims and advocates, including Gloria Allred and Jezebel, thought that the thread was a valuable thing.

is3rt0,The social justice left is the new religous right.,"The left, primarily the ones overly concerned with social justice, are the ""religious right"" of the 2010s and the 2020s. They both have engaged in the same or similar behaviors and share some of the same morals and viewpoints. Here's a list of the similarities.

* **They're both moral puritans, guardians, and prudes, that always cause a moral panic over something they deem immoral or offensive.**
* **They both engage in witch hunts or a form of McCarthyism.**
* **They both have some influence in politics, based on their subjective morals, usually for the worst.**
* **They both use censorship or ""deplatforming""-which is a form of censorship regardless-against anyone or anything they deem immoral.**
* **They both experience the same or similar backlashes or backfire effects, such as, a loss of credibility as a result of censoring or supporting the censoring of their opponents-that's one of the reasons why new atheists defeated the religious right.**
* **They both like to hop on their moral high horse out of arrogance.**
* **They're both sensitive and tend to react poorly to criticism.**
* **They both believe in conspiracies.**
* **They both believe that there's a pipeline to immoral beliefs and behaviors.**
* **They both use the same logical fallacies.**

Now there are some differences to note

* **The obvious difference is the social justice left is at least 70% atheist, while religious right is self-explanatory-they're 99 if not, 100% christian.**
* **Both groups have a different boogeyman: for the social justice, it's fascists and nazis, for the religious, it's the devil and satanists.**
* **While both groups believe in the same slippery slope logic, the difference again is the boogeyman they fear monger about. For example, the social justice left believe there's a ""alt right"" pipeline linking non-leftist politics and offensive humor to fascism. The religious right, since the 1950s, believe there's a satanic pipeline, going from rock music and R-rated movies to satanism.**
* **There's different tactics: the social justice left is more likely to take matters into their own hands to censor their opposition, by ""deplatforming"", due to the influence they have on corporations. Historically, the religious right have used ""deplatforming"" against, atheists, communists, LGBT groups, and pagans, since the 50s. However they much prefer to use legal means to censor their opponents.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/is3rt0/the_social_justice_left_is_the_new_religous_right/,1600021969.0,309,0.93,39,TrueUnpopularOpinion,Bad_Company173

If a moron wants to believe that all women are hypergamous and the right way of life is to marry a hypergamous woman, to whom he must be a 'provider' until she dumps him for a better caretaker, he is entitled to express his 5th grade views and remain a moron. We should create better subreddits to challenge these views and explain and educate why these views are toxic and stupid. What makes reddit so awesome is the fact that we can exchange ideas and reach the truth with full freedom under anonymity. We need to pay the price of putting up with stupid ideas inorder to preserve freedom of speech. We don't have the right to dictate what ideas people in general deserve to get exposed to. We cannot ban any subreddit even if majority of redditors unequivocally agree that the said subreddit has really bad ideas.

Also, believe me, letting people espouse wrong ideas actually HELPS combat them. Wrong ideas innevitably lead to bad consequences for people who believe in them and most reasonable people can see clearly for themselves the difference between right and wrong. I never cared about feminism and gender equality until i was exposed to redpill. Here, for the first time i understood how a seemingly inconsequntial statement like 'men are like this, male mentality is this' or 'women must be like this, female mentality is this' leads to crazy, horrible, self destructive ideologies. It made me value real feminism instead of judging feminism badly based on how some idiotic feminists behave. Banning a toxic subreddit will not make the false idea go away. Just the way, banning drugs doesn't cure the drug menace. These ideologies will remain in a person's mind in his personal space. However, discussing every single idea in an anonymous platform helps us eliminate these wrong ideas better. 

More than anything else, freedom of speech is an individual's basic right. Reddit is the only site where it gets preserved better than in any social networking site and this is the real reason why i enjoy reddit, despite having some annoying people on it.

hv4d09,Jk rowling has a point,"First of all, i am a feminist and by this i mean,  someone who believes that what constitutes a man or a woman is not psychological traits they are expected to possess. I believe that a biological man does not become any less 'male' if he crossdresses, is feminine etc...because these are personality traits. Same for women. I have always sympathized with gender dysphoric people who are expected to fit this rigid cubby hole of gender expectations and not allowed to self express. I utterly despise people who discriminate or ill treat trans population in any way, because who are you to dictate what men and women are supposed to behave like? Gender stereotypes or saying maleness is this (personality wise not anatomically) and femaleness is this is what has been historically used to discriminate and oppress women.

But this is the deal. Most people are entirely missing jk rowling's point and the point that i am tring to convey. Modern transgender activism is a CONTRADICTION of gender equality and spits in the face of what early feminists fought for. It actually SUPPORTS gender stereotypes!

People often quote studies that show sex differences between male and female brains when the above fact is stated. I am not denying the scientific reality that certain traits appear more commonly in female population and others in male population. But this is the tricky part of this study, gender brain differences are like a spectrum, with 80% overlap. Men and women are personality wise much much more similar than different. Transmen (for eg) could be having brains which are slightly more similar to men on that spectrum. (A lot of cis women also have brains more similar to men than the brains of average women without experiencing dysphoria) yes, this brain structure could explain why some  transmen/women have certain atypical personality traits for their gender which culminates in dysphoria. People with dysphoria must try their best to feel comfortable with their biological sex and if NOTHING alleviates their distress, must have the full freedom to opt to alter their body/transition and SHOULD NOT BE ILL TREATED FOR DOING WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY. I don't even mind calling a person who transitioned with the pronoun they are comfortable with, out of respect.

But here is the catch. 

Trans women are NOT women. They are what i will call, effeminate men. Calling trans women, women for having a brain that is slightly closer to a female brain than an average man or having the  personality of a woman is wrong. (what defines male or female personality anyways? Is there a scientifically established definition of what kind of a personality is womanly?) This phenomenon is a lot like saying, on an average boys are taller than girls, so any boy who is short must now be identified as a true girl in a boys body and tall girls are actually boys! Isn't that stupid?

Gender roles create dysphoria. But calling women who fit the gender role of men as men in the wrong body, enhances gender discrimination and archaic views on men and women. (I am not opposed to a woman choosing to undergo transition if it makes her happier or calling the woman by male pronouns after identifying as male or to personal choice of any kind). But saying anyone, regardless of biological sex, calling themselves male is a man and a female is woman (forget anatomy) is moronic. It will create a GREAT deal of problems in the long run. Any amount of transition will not change your biological sex. Stating this obvious fact is making people lose jobs off late.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/hv4d09/jk_rowling_has_a_point/,1595323695.0,186,0.8,135,TrueUnpopularOpinion,redit4speechfreedom

huarwf,"Body Positivity Needs to Be About Acne, Deformities, and Disabilities, Not Letting Fat People Eat Themselves to Death and Promote It","Body positivity and acceptance are almost 100% about overweight people who are doing nothing to help their situation, while acne, deformities, and disabilities are totally out of most people‚Äôs control and they are relentlessly shamed and bullied or not acknowledged or heard.

In brand campaigns, how often do we see someone who is in a wheelchair? Someone who has down syndrome or cerebral palsy? What about women who have battled breast cancer and undergone double mastectomies? People with no limbs? People with severe acne or other skin conditions?

The answer is almost never. But what we do see are 400+lbs people endorsing products and getting millions for destroying their health and telling other people it‚Äôs ok to do it too. That is NOT a healthy way to live, and it should never be encouraged. I‚Äôm not saying these people deserve to be shamed and bullied or attacked at all, I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs scary to see that being 400-500 pounds is all good and fine and it‚Äôs almost praised. 

I think that the modeling world and advertising world did need to become more accepting of other body shapes and types but it‚Äôs gotten out of hand and like I said, we still don‚Äôt see people with acne or disabilities and etc being accepted as ‚Äúbeautiful and inspiring‚Äù.

htqfpo,I think BLM wants people to get hit by cars.,"If you look at any kind of revolutionary strategy, it's a staple that groups try to do things that provoke a harsh response, because that makes them look more sympathetic.

Now consider also that protesters all around the world have developed ways to barricade against cars. Consider that protests often decline to have police barricade and redirect traffic, when it's offered. Consider also that they keep having protests in the road, and there keeps being incidents (50+?) of cars hitting protesters. It seems kind of obvious that organizers are content to throw activists into the meat grinder for public support and media attention.

On that note, almost all of these incidents I see go down like this: a car pulls up and honks, then people mob the car and start hitting it (I've seen one video where someone shoots the car first), then the driver panics and hits the gas. Which seems pretty reasonable? And then of course the media narrative is that another violent reactionary attacked the protests. When a black man ran over two white protesters in Seattle, killing one, the narrative I saw develop immediately about it was still that it was anti black racism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/htqfpo/i_think_blm_wants_people_to_get_hit_by_cars/,1595114718.0,63,0.84,59,TrueUnpopularOpinion,[deleted]

However, many videos have surfaced showing whites, in groups, being asked by BLM or misc. protest groups to kneel in solidarity. Also, sometimes to put their hands up, or renounce ""white privilege."" Some have even washed African-American protester's feet.

If you're white and you do this, I no longer take you seriously. You are either obsequisouly attempting to fit in, or attempting to signal virtue emptily.

While not all cops are bad caps, I agree that there are problems with police in America, e.g. police brutality and cops not holding their fellow cops accountable. As such, I can understand why some people in America march and protest for that. And it would make sense for Americans to march for that, as these are problems and events happening in their home country

That said, Europeans protesting problems in the US is the most annoying shit I've seen all week. You don't give two fucks about injustices. You just care about appearing like you care. Where were your mass protests for the thriving slave trade in the Arab world? Where were your mass protests for the Uyghur Muslims being put in *literal* concentration camps in China?

h0xe1x,"Everyone's calling Trump the Nazi/extremist, but tearing down statues, banning media and de-platforming 'racists' reminds me of what the soviets and mao's cultural revolution did.","I think we often forget to look on the other side of the political spectrum to see that extremists come in two shades. Extremism doesn't exist only under the banner of racial superiority but also under the naive utopianistic flag of 'equality'. In the case of the communist chinese, this was class equality, and I'm sure this seemed like a great idea for the millions of young students who preached ""class equality"" whilst burning books, national flags, sending teachers, parents (etc.) into work camps or outright shooting 'class oppressors'. In Cambodia the communist  Khmer Rouge  took this a step further and figured 'men who wear glasses' was an enough of a superior class signifier, and as with all superior classes, they were shot or relocated to forced labour camps. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if we're to compare our current political goings on to history, we can draw the line two ways. It's very popular amongst liberals and twitterites to draw the Trump = Hitler conclusion, but if we're playing this game, I'm going to draw the reverse card. The current BLM craze reminds me of the exact frenzy that happened in communist china and soviet union. The same destructive frenzy that was heralded under the banner of 'equality' (and lets not fool ourselves, this was envy/ bitterness as much as a desire for equality). So on the metaphor of card games, lets look at an example of today's social revisionism : Magic The Gathering has removed certain ideologically awkward cards. I think ideologues are blind to parody. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really this frenzy is very awkward. It makes me cringe actually . I respond to BLM the way I respond to nationalist sentiments on remembrance days: I would prefer not to.

h0u9ii,JK Rowling Is Right," This post got removed automatically from BOTH r/unpopularopinion and r/TrueOffMyChest 

This is certainly unpopular on both Reddit, Twitter and even Tumblr, though I imagine it's less unpopular on places like Facebook and in the real world.

JK Rowling wrote an incredibly well-thought out article, filled with factual statements, statistics and research from educated sources. But the hyperwoke extreme left are not interested in the safety, the history, the reality of biological women and would rather that 50% of the world population, women, shut up and lower their heads in favour of the 2% that are trans identifying.

She also got blasted for doing this during the BLM movement, but she includes women of color in her statements, which is also ignored. Women's rights are black women's rights too. It's also heinous to imply that there is a ""right"" and ""wrong"" time to care for women's rights. Or rights not concerning BLM, which I find horrendously Americentric. While BLM is turning into a worldwide issues, in certain places in the world, women's rights precede this movement.

I understand that from an American viewpoint, she might seem like she is ""overreacting"", but that only exemplifies ignorance considering the state that the UK, the country she lives in, is in. She provides multiple statements from various sources regarding the current state of the UK regarding gender ideology, but this too is ignored.

Within her article, she discusses how she is concerned for the comfort, safety and rights of biological women. However, most of the discussion I see directed towards her only care about her supposedly transphobic language.

All this does, to me, is show me what a horrendously misogynistic culture the woke left has turned into. They do not care for the rights of women - and I am sure this is an unpopular statement on reddit because I constantly see posts on [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) and [r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/) about how women are the priviliged gender, etc. All they care about is competing in this weird race to seem the most ""progressive"" and ""woke"" and ""inclusive"" without considering the ramification it has on actual women.

So, do yourself a favour and read her statement, especially if you initially disagreed with it and especially if you're the type to just tell her to shut up. It might open your eyes.

Sidenote: It is also fascinating, in an incredibly depressing way, that the woke left completely forgets about transMEN during all of this. It's always ""transwomen are women!"" ""womxn!"" and so on. They rarely discuss the rights of trans men. Which again just tells me this is a majorly sexist movement, once again ignoring biological females in favour of biological men.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/h0u9ii/jk_rowling_is_right/,1591859562.0,133,0.92,32,TrueUnpopularOpinion,IAmHereForDiscourse

gzgp59,"The biggest issue in the black community is not racism, it's culture."," This is something that's been bothering me for a while. Especially with all the protests going on now. Which for a disclaimer: I do think there has to be some sort of cop reform because they get away with a lot of shit that they shouldn't get away with. This applies to ALL RACES because it's an ALL RACE issue.

With that being said, it bothers me how unfocused people are. Everything is being drawn to race. When there are more logical conclusions that make more sense. Let's go down the rabbit hole.

It is a fact that black people commit a [disproportionate amount of crime or violence.](https://i.imgur.com/pkN8yWB.jpg) Especially when black men only account for 6% of the population while black women account for 7%. So why is this? Why are black men and women committing such a large amount of America's crime?

The answer is simple, poverty. Black people are disproportionally in poverty and odds are they'll grow up in poor neighborhoods. There's been a bunch of studies that find direct correlation between poverty and violence with teenagers. As well people from poor backgrounds are disproportionately selected into the juvenile justice system and retained there by decision making based on many things, including their impoverished status. This system marginalizes the most vulnerable group of society which makes it difficult for them to move on as they mature.

So how do we solve this? Some people may suggest affirmative action or reparations. But both don't address the problem and provides no real solutions, it only enables the problem.

So if blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crime, it's safe to assume that that's partially the reason why they're targeted by cops more. Because generally speaking, they're committing more crime for such a small population.

So what's the solution to this? Well, there's a huge issue with the number of single parenthood homes. It's just a fact that if you have both parents in the home you are less likely to end up in jail, less likely to join gangs, and less likely to be poor.

Both parents will also fill the void that is sometimes filled by gangs. If fewer people are joining gangs, fewer people are committing crimes, then fewer people are going to jail which means poverty will decrease over time.

This is not to say that racism, hate, or laws do not play a part in ""holding black people back."" Of course and I think some laws will eventually be changed to help out with that. But I think the core of the issue is a cultural problem and no law or reparations will ever be able to fix that.

There's more I want to say but this is already insanely long as it is. So perhaps some of this will be continued in the comments.
