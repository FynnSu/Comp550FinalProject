juqucl,My dad is an extreme Trump supporter,"This is going to be quite a long post. I need to vent and want some outside perspectives.

I am liberal and my dad is an extreme Trump supporter. Over the past 4 years, it has been hard. As a result in the recent months, we setup a civil debate on topics that we alternate who decides. I'm looking for anyone with any experience in this and can offer some advice.

Here is my story...

# Background

I grew up approx. 40 minutes outside New York City. Both of my father's parents are liberals. My dad is educated, Jewish, has an immigrant wife, had an abortion for his girlfriend at 22, exposed to diversity on a regular basis since he works in NYC and at one point was considered liberal.

He became a republican, when Bush ran, for financial reasons. However, he is now a pro-life, anti-liberal, gun obsessed, Fox News loving, all in Trump fanatic. He reasons and believes every one of Trump's lies(and those who support him).

When Trump was elected in 2016, I tried to avoid all talks about politics to avoid the blow up fights. To be honest, it ate away at me every day. I thought to myself how could this privileged and educated man be so brainwashed. This summer when COVID hit and BLM protests broke out I started to boil. I thought about how to approach the situation with my dad and my execution went pretty poorly. It ended up being a phone call where he was screaming ""planned parenthood is a baby killing mill"" and more outrageous comments.

At that point I froze, this man who told me when I was younger I could be whatever I wanted, to look at all people equally and inclusiveness is better than exclusiveness was not the man who I was talking to. I told him straight-up I don't see us having more than surface level relationship and I can't have this toxicity in my life. I told him I thought he was on the wrong side of history, which actually brought silence, I felt that got to him for some reason(but thats an assumption). I also continued to tell him that his uneducated and unverified claims did not warrant such an emotional response. Surprisingly, at that point my dad suggested we do monthly debates.

# The Debate

Each month we alternate who picks a topic. After he suggested this I put together a debate doc to help structure each debate. I even had us put our goals down for what we want to achieve in this process, so we can remind ourselves whenever things got heated. The structure is we have 2-3 days to pick a topic after our prior debate, 2 weeks for us to both provide research(articles, documentaries, videos, etc.) to support our claim and then an additional 2 weeks to review each others research.

The first topic I decided on was **False information is a serious problem with irreversible consequences that cause a massive divide in America.** I did this to plan how we would conduct our research, deem what sources are credible, decide on tools we would use to fact check and define certain terms. This was setup to prevent a back and forth on what is fact and fiction.

I wanted to encourage him to think twice before believing information he read from biased sources and  verify his information using other sources. A goal of mine is to have productive debates based on educated, well sourced and non-partisan content. While agreeing that some of our content would be biased and left/right leaning, but the claims made need to be based on **credible facts**.

My research included:

* [How Your Brain Tricks You Into Believing Fake News](https://time.com/5362183/the-real-fake-news-crisis/)
* HBO's [After Truth](https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/after-truth-disinformation-and-the-cost-of-fake-news)
* A [John Oliver clip](https://www.hbo.com/video/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/seasons/season-7/episodes/138-episode-197/videos/july-19-2020-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories)
* [YouTube Radicalization](https://medium.com/@markoledwich/youtube-radicalization-an-authoritative-saucy-story-28f73953ed17) \- this was to help show my understanding that even liberals can produce fake news. My goal was to help see that I try to find the truth with FACTS over opinion.

His research included:

* [This is how fake news spreads](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/14/this-is-how-fake-news-spreads/)
* A article that no longer exists, but essentially it  discussed Google extending fact checking to image search
* Unfreedom Press by Mark Levin, that we both agreed was far too long to get through in 2 weeks - *Reddit even reported this as fake, so I removed the link*

My approach to this, was to review the limited research he provided. I read Dennis Pragner's article and it seemed apparent this guy focused on his opinion over facts. First, I used a few fact checkers on Dennis to see his credibility, which was amazingly low. To prove this, I went through roughly 10-15 of Dennis's most recent articles and put together data.

* One spreadsheet listed his 13 most recent articles how many times he used the words left leaning words such a **Left, Democrat,** and **Liberal** and right leaning words such as **Right, Conservative** and **Republican.**
* Then I researched top spin words &amp; phrases, subjective statements and emotional terms to see how he was using emotion to persuade his audience of his claims. I created a doc highlighting how often he used these terms.
* Also in the doc with the content from his articles I made a list of all words that he surrounded the left leaning terms he used in the first spreadsheet.

My results were that he used used *112 left leaning words* and *8 right leaning words*. Some examples of the words he used surrounding the left included:

* Every *leftist*
* Lying
* Russian collusion
* Indistinguishable
* Brands
* Abolish standards
* As they have done for decades
* Denounce
* Reaction
* Mantra
* Bringing America down
* The communists
* Don’t give a damn
* *If* *the left* cared

Anyway, without my opinion and solely using Dennis's words I was able to convince my dad that Dennis was not credible. It was a victory I did not think I'd get so easily. I felt after our first debate that we made real progress. He even went as far to say ""Yeah, I don't know why I was getting so emotional and I won't read Dennis Pragner anymore"" It was awesome.

The victory I felt was not based on that he agreed with me, but that we were able to agree on verifiable facts. This is and has been my goal so far. Let's get past debating what is verifiably true, since to me it's common sense and obvious, and let's focus on factual information that we can discuss.

As a result from our first debate we agreed upon certain definitions, a few tools we can use to fact check and how we would judge credibility and that we want to avoid content with extreme bias.  In addition, we shared an understanding that there will be manipulation and bias in documentaries, articles, etc., we send each other to persuade the audience of what the author is saying. However, the claims, evidence and research the author presents must be factual. **There is a difference of using manipulation and bias to convince the audience of false information and verified information.** This is what we as an audience have to judge, is the bias or manipulation credible?

# The Problem

However, it feels like all the work I am doing and how far we get, the progress just reverts. I'm frustrated and don't know when I should just throw in the towel. The second debate we had, my dad decided on **Appointment of Supreme Court Justices**. The debate was ok, but I didn't spend as much time as I did in the first debate. I learned a lot, however I felt there wasn't much for us to debate. However, I still felt we were on the right track and agreed upon being factual versus emotional/opinionated on unverifiable facts. His research supported this and was way more interesting and factual this time around.

For our upcoming debate I decided on **The Republican Party’s Conflict with Science &amp; How it Affected America’s Response to COVID-19**. Both of our research was due last Thursday and here is the list:

* [A Sensible and Compassionate Anti-COVID Strategy](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/sensible-compassionate-anti-covid-strategy/?utm_term=emailclicks&amp;utm_campaign=imprimis&amp;utm_medium=housefile-email&amp;_hsmi=98690753&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9k8qDZgV-TFamTIpUNpPp3hyR86Vzn95oIJtK1Q7eeuZ1IPVHEGpsBuO7HCun2VtMf48ypDCX-zVReAGGamAEiUohXvg&amp;utm_content=SensibleAntiCOVIDStrategyOCT&amp;utm_source=email)

Initially I read the Breitbart article, [CDC Journal: Cloth Mask 'May give users a False Sense of Protection' against Coronavirus'](https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/10/28/cdc-journal-cloth-masks-may-give-users-a-false-sense-of-protection-against-coronavirus/), which refers to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus(first red flag). From the fake news discussion, I felt we were aligned. I don't want to have to go through the exercise I already did or use the limited time we have for our debate on what is credible information. I had hoped we were moving past this. I decided to message him ""it's hard for me to take an article seriously, when they are consistently referring to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus."" We had a small back and forth, but it was civil and he understood. In addition, I searched a few fact checkers on Breitbart's credibility and it's labeled as a questionable source, extreme right-wing bias and publication of conspiracy theories and propaganda with numerous false claims. It shows he did zero fact checking here, which we agreed we would do with our research.

Then I started watching **Fibs, Falsehoods and Fauci**, done by Mark Levin on BlazeTV.  The main topic was discussing Trump's ad campaign and using Fauci saying in an interview ""I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more"" in regards to Trump. I got about 10 minutes and felt defeated. I know the situation well and knew Mark Levin was claiming verifiably false information as true. So, in our google doc, I flagged this video as verifiably false and stated that I conducted minimal research into BlazeTV's credibility. My findings were that BlazeTV has some credibility concerns.

We are currently in a back and forth on this topic, *yet again*. I'm am spending a TON of time and energy on this. Repeating to myself that I gotta put my all into this and if it doesn't work out I know I had done everything I could.

I haven't gone through the rest of his research, but I'm just feeling super down and hopeless. When do I know I need to walk away? How do I know if I should keep trying? I'm conflicted and frustrated.

hv3nx0,Is it wrong to cut family out of your life for still supporting Trump at this point?,"Is it wrong to cut family out of your life for still supporting Trump at this point?  Not just voting for him b/c they are republican and that's their only option but still acknowledging that he's a dangerous fool, but like still being total fans of his, going to rallies, etc.

I'm a middle aged adult, my parents were very good to me throughout my life and helped me succeed in life. However they also were moderately racist and taught me this racist behavior was ok. Not Klan level racist, but using the N-word and always making fun of black people.

Now that I'm an adult and I'm married to a black woman, I really regret how I grew up, things that were said behind closed doors, and behaviors I grew up thinking were no big deal.  I'm angry at my parents over this and over still supporting this dangerous, ill-informed lunatic after all that we've seen the past four years.

The open racism sort of stopped after I got serious with my wife. But what happened in the past for many years eats away at me. With the amount of incompetence and corruption we've seen from trump at this point, I believe that the only reason anyone still supports him is because he's racist.

I stopped answering their calls a few months ago. My best friend also of 30 years (he's actually a democrat but extremely racist, more than my trumper parents).

I am conflicted but I resent them and I don't want to hear any of it ever again or have my wife hear any of it, which unfortunately she has already.

htwriq,US Anti-Mask Conservatives are Motivated by Irrational Ignorant Machismo,"It may be hard to believe, but I am not cherry picking their reasoning here. It is representative of the answers I get on this subject.

Figuring Reddit had the best chance of meeting pro-mask conservatives, I posted in r/Conservative, which boasts 390k members.

My pro-mask post received 50% upvotes, for a score of zero. The [top comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ht34if/american_rightwingers_should_embrace_voluntary/fyf0alm/), by u/banjopicker, justifies the anti-mask position. My rebuttal to it was not published, indicating moderator agreement with Banjo. In the absence of anything better, I'm forced to take it seriously.

First, Banjopicker accuses me of being ""somewhat hysterical"", which is like calling someone ""somewhat enraged"": in other words, angry. It is true that I am irritated, disgusted, and disappointed. However, Banjopicker's insinuation that I am afflicted with a feminine irrational fear is false. Rather, his response reads as moronic machismo.

This is demonstrated in the very next line, wherein he bravely asserts: ""I won’t be tied to a mask over a 99.3% recovery rate."" That implies a .7% CFR, which, if it swept the USA, would kill 2.3 million, nearly doubling the yearly death rate of 2.8 million. For comparison, only 170k die of accidents, yet no one objects to seat belts and helmets.

Obligatory common sense clarification:  I'm not saying one must always wear the blue-white surgical mask. I wear a cycling neck gaiter in public and raise it when strangers might fear infection or around public hand surfaces.

Banjo next asserts, ""The significant majority has nothing to worry about."" This is true, assuming they do not care about any of the vulnerable elderly. Machismo or psychopathy? You decide. However, I fail to see how the elderly are supposed to quarantine themselves from asymptomatic carriers among the able-bodied young on whom they depend.

""This is largely a political power play,"" Banjo judges. Certainly, lockdown is a dramatic exercise of state power. Yet Banjo seems incapable of grasping that masks intrinsically favor the wearer in a political struggle. For example, masked state enforcers act with anonymous impunity. The same applies to masked dissidents, as Antifa know well. Which is why Hong Kong's government is trying to [ban protesters from wearing masks](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3092714/hong-kong-protests-top-court-hear-legal-challenge), an effort severely impeded by high citizen adherence to voluntary mask culture.

By ""power play,"" Banjo alludes to the split between pro-lockdown Democrats and anti-lockdown Republicans. The logical thing would be for Republicans to embrace masks to reduce hospitalizations, with empty beds shaming Democrats into lifting restrictions. But this chain of reasoning seems too complicated for the macho conservative amygdala, which can only muster an ""ignore, fight or flee"" trichotomous response. Since COVID19 is ""ignore"" and Democrats are ""fight"", the conservative cannot agree with Democrats on masks in order to better fight Democrats on lockdown by reducing COVID19's impact to negligible.

COVID19 can be stopped either by strong government or voluntary citizen anti-contagion measures, but taking no countermeasures leads to overwhelmed hospitals and morgues. The US government's countermeasures were delayed and ineffective, so it's up to the citizens. Conservatives are failing to pull their weight, which justly angers the portion of the population rational on the issue. Which leads to my last point:

&gt;Banjo&gt; the science is not conclusive on the capability of masks to protect you. For every article you post on the benefits, I can post a research paper that says the opposite.

This is more idiotic machismo. He boasts his citational prowess on an irrelevant point.

Coughing and sneezing [project sprays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnafrAtfMzE) of germ-laden saliva quite far. It is unquestionable that masks stop quite a lot of that spray, thereby reducing respiratory contagion.

Obviously a basic fabric mask can't compete with a hazmat suit. To point this out is asinine. The goal is to reduce the contagiousness of the overall pandemic, and reducing the range of respiratory droplet sprays does so admirably.

It would be just as idiotic to argue against handwashing during an epidemic because handwashing doesn't kill 100% of germs. It's identical logic. Here, I'll even link a research paper proving one shouldn't wash hands anymore:

from [The Effect of Handwashing with Water or Soap on Bacterial Contamination of Hands](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21318017/):

&gt;Handwashing with plain soap and water reduced the presence of bacteria to 8%

Clearly handwashing is ineffective and a political power play backed by hysterical advocates!

cw3v7t,Are there any state or local Democratic officials committed to prosecuting the crimes of ICE agents and contractors?,"This seems like a pretty straightforward case of law-and-order needing to be restored.  Under the Trump insurgency, ICE no longer operates as a law enforcement agency, but as a criminal conspiracy tied to hate groups.  

They openly break the law on a constant basis, engage in kidnapping and false imprisonment, hostage-taking, extortion rackets, ransom demands, child endangerment/abuse/neglect, and first degree murder by causing the deaths of their captives.

So regardless of whatever technicality or maneuver the regime might try to avoid justice, I'd like to know if any state or local Democratic officials are committed to pursuing it.  E.g., 

* Ordering CPS visits to children in detention.

* Seeking arrest warrants for ICE agents, officials, and contractors.

* Seeking restraining orders against same.

Etc.

Never mind the fact that Obama began his presidency almost exactly 65 years after the end of WWII.
Never mind the fact that college enrollment hit record highs under the Obama presidency.
Never mind the endless string of fact checks pointing out these nuances and others showing why that number is where it is.
The criticism was based on the number alone, and mitigating factors were discussed rarely, if ever.
I'd say it's time to start talking about this statistic, if only to point out that there's more to labor force participation than just this number.

6sd6ay,Can we agree not to generalize conservatives?,"**TL;DR for those who don't want to read this whole thing: no, we cannot agree to it.  Strong arguments from both sides, though I believe some attempts to call me racist or conservative were confusing and misguided.**  
  
Update: because there has been significant interest in my doing so, I posted the same question (but about liberals) in /r/conservative.  It was denied by moderators.  
   
**Edit:  I'm trying to reply to your comments.  Sometimes my replies appear as though I've been shadowbanned, but it's only for some so I'm not sure what to think about that.  Everyone makes good points.  Some of the attitude and overall nastiness of some members within the community has been really sad to see as a long time liberal and newcomer to this subreddit.**  
  
**Please know that I'm not a troll or here to ""defend racists"" as some have ridiculously suggested.  I'm here because I'm a left leaning person with many conservatives who I am friends with and care about, and I want to see our ideology progress to one which can draw people in from across the aisle, rather than burn the bridge between it.**  
  
**The other half of the country does have reasonable people in it.  It's actually really made me pretty sad to see how firmly people doubt that.**  
  
  
It feels like we're constantly in a struggle of Liberal vs. Conservative instead of America vs. Our Issues.  All I hear about are how ""all conservatives are racist"" or ""all liberals are idiots"" etc etc..  
  
I believe that this is incredibly misguided on both sides.  These groups of people represent so many millions of Americans and each ideology has fostered incredible genius.  All conservatives aren't racist.  All conservatives aren't idiots.  Conservative ideology has many admirable tenets, regardless of whether we see them as the right fit for our country today.  Often times, Conservatives are smart, honest people just like how I would characterize many of us.  
  
It would speak greatly to our ideology if we were to make a push toward dropping this negative rhetoric that both sides have been employing for most of my life and instead focus on how we can work to humanize all people, regardless of ideology, and progress our country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/6sd6ay/can_we_agree_not_to_generalize_conservatives/,1502195625.0,95,0.72,159,Liberal,TheLoneDonut

Then other times I just voiced my distaste for whatever the subject was in a somewhat reasonable manner. One comment is all it took to get banned from each sub. Nothing I say is anywhere near as bad as the trump trolls that roam almost every subreddit getting downvoted to oblivion but not banned. They claim to be pro freedom of speech, anti PC, and anti safe spaces but are so quick to ban those with opposing views. I know it's no surprise that they're huge hypocrites. I'm just a little bothered that I get banned for some relatively decent comments while their troll army is everywhere spewing their garbage.

6lhn5c,"CNN was fully within its rights to reveal the name of the 30-40+ year old alt-righter/neo-Nazi who was involved in a national news story--that's one of the things the news does, name people in national news stories--but refrained from doing so even though he has posted heinously racist things","1) He's not a 15 year old LGBT kid. He's a grown-ass man, somewhere from his late 20s to mid-40s: https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882533322160832512

Confirming he lives in Tennessee and is almost finished with his doctorate: https://i.imgur.com/gXkiLKu.jpg

Confirming he left Maryland in 1990: https://i.imgur.com/2g6MFdm.png

2) CNN didn't blackmail anyone. They did him a favor by not releasing his name. The First Amendment protects you from the government. It doesn't stop others from using their free speech to criticize your bigotry.

Racists will cry about free speech because they know their views are not accepted in public. It's not doxxing when CNN reports your name. It's journalism.

The news reports people's names all the time. Being anonymous on 4chan and reddit doesn't give you a right to remain anonymous if you're careless with your personal information and you do something newsworthy.

3) CNN also didn't doxx anyone. Again, they did him a favor by not releasing his information. CNN was perfectly within their rights and ethics to investigate this guy because he was part of a nationally-relevant news story.

The president re-tweeting something you said makes you into a person of public interest whether you like it or not, whether you posted it semi-anonymously or not.

4) He said FAR WORSE things than the GIF:

&gt; June 2017: HanAssholeSolo posted an image of CNN journalists and employees with a Star of David next to them writing, “Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it...” [above]

&gt; “FBI stats don’t lie n-----. You hood rats account for more that 50% of the murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the USA.”

&gt; “I just like dancing when n------ are getting beat down by the cops.”

&gt; “I guess letting them [Muslims] into your country and then being killed by them if you don't conform to their stone age ideology is? You can't win with these f------ wake the f--- up the only way to win is to eradicate them 100% they cannot integrate into modern society they take over like cockroaches.”

5zbjc5,Trump the rich guy and his very rich Republican party can only think about giving a tax break to their rich buddies under Trumpcare rather than taking care of these 24 million Americans whose healthcare will be gutted as per the latest C.B.O. report.,"Yes, if only a multi billionaire Trump and his billionaire buddies in the Republican party, whose coffer was filled up thanks to the huge amount of money that their very rich donors are pouring in, could think in a sensible way what their Trumpcare plan are going to do 24 million American citizens like us and also the legal residents of this great country, they'd have abandoned their very ill conceived and very malicious plan which is going to kill more people here from lack of a basic healthcare that what a small time famine can do in an impoverished country in Africa.

Actually Trump and the Republicans are still in denial that they've been left standing on their broken legs since this very shocking and a very damning C.B.O. report came out 2 days back saying very correctly that at least 24 million of our people will lose their only lifeline that Obamacare provided to them in 2010 through the Democratic healthcare bill which covered more number of Americans that anyone could dream then.

But Trump and the Republicans started denigrating this latest report long before it came out.

They didn't care that this report was compiled by the same bipartisan government agency as before. Nothing's changed.

And it's quite an irony to hear Trump complain about this report whereas he always used C.B.O. reports to cuss Obama""on economic growth,tax cuts,employment and other issues"" as mentioned in a NYT column.

But now the same Trump, who'd always shown a tendency to accept news that was favorable to him and rejected the results that pointed out his faults, is once again trying to prove to his ignorant followers that this report was biased from the very beginning.

He has no intention to tell them the truth that C.B.O. office has equal number of Democrats and Republicans in it.

Yes Trump is the same man, who denounced the job numbers when it said the number of jobless Americans are much lower since Obama came in, blaming the report on Obama's henchmen, is now touting the higher number of American employed in February as if it happened because of him.

For Trump the lower unemployment numbers could never happen if he didn't win the presidential election.

He also takes credit for higher growth and the rise in stock market telling his under educated followers that Dow Jones Industrial marker was going down when Obama was president but shot up since he came into power.

5z58xw,"To start winning again,the Democrats have to shed their goody goody personalities and go on an all out war of words and wits to take over the congress next year.","Yes, if the Democrats in congress want to take the party back to those glory days when they held all the power and the Republican party was on oxygen and on life support, then they've to remove their shackles that they put on themselves by trying to be Mr. Nice or Ms. Gentle.

There were many reasons why Trump won and the Democrats lost everything.

And one of them was not capitalizing on Obama's win on Nov 4th, 2008 when his win gave them the Senate with 60 Democrats to 40 Republican Senators.

But soon after, the Democrats fumbled miserably in the mid term elections in 2010, losing their majorities in the congress and also their strength and stamina that always defined our renowned party which is compassionate to begin with. 

And will remain compassionate till the end.

Our Senate Democrats started bungling with one mistake after another. 

With the healthcare bill first they consumed most of their time than creating jobs in America which should've been their No. 1 priority.

Second, being nice to the Republicans who'd made a resolve to malign Obama's legacy by bringing down his government, the Democrats got bogged down in lengthy discussions on the future of Obamacare.

The amount of time that they should've spent in creating jobs in America mainly through punishing the employers who were creating millions of jobs in impoverished countries, the Congressional Democrats went on adding countries to their NAFTA like agreements.

Lo and behold, we're suddenly in the minority in 2 branches of Government. And might even lose the 3rd one when the Republicans will put their guy in the S.C.O.T.U.S. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5z58xw/to_start_winning_againthe_democrats_have_to_shed/,1489415093.0,77,0.8,43,Liberal,ihatejoemcCarthy

5yybbp,Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney might be related to Mr. Bharara becoming a nightmare for all the insider traders in the Wall Street including many of Trump's friends and associates in New York.,"Yes, by firing of Preet Bharara Trump has shown that he doesn't want to clean the swamp in Washington or elsewhere in the country, especially in New York where Trump grew up and where most of Trump's shady businesses are located.

Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.

The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.

Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.

And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. 

Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.

So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.

By going after the same people in the Wall Street, Mr. Bharara very inadvertently might've come across some big names in the hedge fund industry who were using insider trading as a way to make billions of dollars for billionaires like Trump and his partners in crime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5yybbp/trumps_firing_of_us_attorney_might_be_related_to/,1489318930.0,250,0.89,30,Liberal,ihatejoemcCarthy

5r10ir,Is the Muslim ban simply a cover? Pay very close attention over the next several days...,"""I don't like to talk about politics on Facebook-- political history is my job, after all, and you are my friends-- but there is an important non-partisan point to make today. 

What Bannon is doing, most dramatically with last night's ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a ""shock event."" Such an event is unexpected and confusing and throws a society into chaos. People scramble to react to the event, usually along some fault line that those responsible for the event can widen by claiming that they alone know how to restore order. When opponents speak out, the authors of the shock event call them enemies. As society reels and tempers run high, those responsible for the shock event perform a sleight of hand to achieve their real goal, a goal they know to be hugely unpopular, but from which everyone has been distracted as they fight over the initial event. There is no longer concerted opposition to the real goal; opposition divides along the partisan lines established by the shock event.

Last night's Executive Order has all the hallmarks of a shock event. It was not reviewed by any governmental agencies or lawyers before it was released, and counterterrorism experts insist they did not ask for it. People charged with enforcing it got no instructions about how to do so. Courts immediately have declared parts of it unconstitutional, but border police in some airports are refusing to stop enforcing it. 

Predictably, chaos has followed and tempers are hot.

My point today is this: unless you are the person setting it up, it is in no one's interest to play the shock event game. It is designed explicitly to divide people who might otherwise come together so they cannot stand against something its authors think they won't like. I don't know what Bannon is up to-- although I have some guesses-- but because I know Bannon's ideas well, I am positive that there is not a single person whom I consider a friend on either side of the aisle-- and my friends range pretty widely-- who will benefit from whatever it is. If the shock event strategy works, though, many of you will blame each other, rather than Bannon, for the fallout. And the country will have been tricked into accepting their real goal. 

But because shock events destabilize a society, they can also be used positively. We do not have to respond along old fault lines. We could just as easily reorganize into a different pattern that threatens the people who sparked the event. A successful shock event depends on speed and chaos because it requires knee-jerk reactions so that people divide along established lines. This, for example, is how Confederate leaders railroaded the initial southern states out of the Union. If people realize they are being played, though, they can reach across old lines and reorganize to challenge the leaders who are pulling the strings. This was Lincoln's strategy when he joined together Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, anti-Nebraska voters, and nativists into the new Republican Party to stand against the Slave Power. Five years before, such a coalition would have been unimaginable. Members of those groups agreed on very little other than that they wanted all Americans to have equal economic opportunity. Once they began to work together to promote a fair economic system, though, they found much common ground. They ended up rededicating the nation to a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" 

Confederate leaders and Lincoln both knew about the political potential of a shock event. As we are in the midst of one, it seems worth noting that Lincoln seemed to have the better idea about how to use it.""


The post is not mine. It originated from a person named Heather Richardson (apparently she's on the top search result for shock event). And I would appreciate it if it were shared to other left leaning forums so we can maintain focus (I would love to, but the ten minute rule). Thanks.

5e3zkh,How we can reduce Breitbart's revenue by more than 50%,"Breitbart seems to make most of its ad revenue from Google Adwords and a couple other random ad services like Taboola.  Major advertisers are using these services and inadvertently running ads on Breitbart (and therefore are funneling money to Breitbart).

Any advertiser that uses Adwords or another service can decide to block particular sites, like Breitbart.com, in their ad settings and it will not show any of their ads on that site.  It would take their ad manager about 2 minutes to add it to their blocked list.

We can reduce Breitbart's ad revenue by 50% or more by getting the largest, highest paying advertisers to stop running ads on their site. 

What to do:

1. Go to Breitbart.com and look at what AdWords ads you see (dont click any ads or they will get revenue).

2. Take a screenshot of the page showing that its on Breitbart and the advertiser.

3. Tweet the screenshot at the advertiser, something like this: "".@adidas Why are you running AdWords ads on Breitbart? Please stop supporting their hateful propaganda."" (Adidas really does run AdWords on Breitbart, so does Amazon and many others.)

This should be very winnable with most major corporations because any specific advertiser has little reason to care about keeping their ads on Breitbart (unless they are selling confederate flags or something targeting that audience in particular) and very big reasons to not face a consumer backlash for supporting such a horrible site.

I've tweeted at about 30 advertisers, but there are probably many more that I don't see because the ads aren't targeted at me.  And I think it's working -- many of the advertisers I tweeted at are no longer appearing for me when I check the site.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5e3zkh/how_we_can_reduce_breitbarts_revenue_by_more_than/,1479734503.0,93,0.85,25,Liberal,disbooya

5d2boc,Trump's first 100 day plans have some disastrous consequences on the environment,"If you haven't seen Trump's plans for his first 100 days as president here's the link.

http://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/501451368/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days


Okay first off let me say this, I don't disagree with everything on this list. The first item of the first list being term limits on congress, and the fourth item being a 5 year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists, I actually do agree. However, the anti-immigration and the things I wanted to focus in on in this post, the anti-environmentalist portions are what worry me here. 

Look at the second list of proposals to ""protect American workers"" particularly five and six. Essentially what he's saying he'll do is take out these restrictions put in place to protect the environment and let the fuel and energy industry go nuts. Yeah sure it'll make some jobs but it will be a disaster for the environment, not that he would care, being a climate change/global warming denier who's putting another climate change denier at the head of the EPA. We spend a lot of time looking at his bigotry against women, immigrants, racial minorities, and the LGBT community, and that's all very important to look at but we need to also really be bashing him over this anti-enviornment garbage too lest we end up like China where you can't just casually take a shower and you can't see your hand in front of your fuckin face cause there's so much smog in the air.

On top of that those little things I said I agreed with, the anti-establishment propositions almost certainly won't go through because the establishment has to approve against their own self interest, while these anti-environment and anti-immigration proposals likely will go through. If he really isn't full of shit we have a lot to be fearful of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5d2boc/trumps_first_100_day_plans_have_some_disastrous/,1479214233.0,81,0.93,24,Liberal,Autumn-Moonlight

5cx500,I attended an anti-Trump rally and was severely disappointed in what I saw.,"There were a couple hundred people at this particular rally this weekend.  We were supposed to march down main street, but it ended up just being a gathering with people speaking in front of city hall. 

No problem, right?  

Well... there was a problem.  I watched about 15-20 people speak.  What they had to say left me feeling embarrassed.  Maybe even a little angry.  

Why?

Because when white people got on the megaphone, half of them started with ""I know I'm white, but...""

So what?  Who cares about your race?  Why does that have to be a disclaimer?  This makes me think that many Trump voters voted for Trump because they thought they lived in a culture where they need to apologize for their white race.

Aside from the those annoying opening comments *every other speech* was about a person who was afraid they would be disenfranchised.  

""I don't want my rights as a trans woman to be taken away!""

""As a proud lesbian, I'm afraid I won't be able to marry my girlfriend!""

""Now I won't have a safe space to go to if I need to talk about my problems with other like-minded people.""

""I'm a Muslim and I'm afraid I won't be able to wear my hiijab!""

20 people.  Over and over and over again thinking of nobody but themselves.  I left when there was a line of 30 or more people waiting to say the exact same thing.  It was unbearable. 

*Of course* equality for all is a very important aspect for all, but can we stop being so incredibly selfish?

I'm starting to get the feeling that conservatives weren't voting *for* Trump, but they were voting *against* the mindset of people who are only self-interested (which is ironic, but that's another topic...)

You know what no one mentioned?

Climate change.

The war on drugs.

Alternative energy

""filling GTMO up with bad guys""

Nuclear arms

CLIMATE CHANGE

I get that some of you will feel like you won't be treated fairly by Donald Trump.  But none of that will matter when our resources are gone, our food doesn't grow, and nuclear threats are looming. 

Does nobody care about these issues but me?  Is nobody pissed off about *that*?

We need to focus our energy and anger on more than just things that benefit individuals.  We need to focus on making the world better.  Then we can focus on ourselves.

Does anyone else share my sentiments?

**Edit:**  Thank you for all the great discussion points.  I know I have learned a few things and heard some excellent perspectives.  Just please don't think I'm trying to ignore or denigrate the emotions that minorities are feeling.  My point isn't to say ""they don't matter"".  I care deeply about equality for all.  It's to say ""Other things matter too.  And these issues also need attention.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5cx500/i_attended_an_antitrump_rally_and_was_severely/,1479144516.0,104,0.72,85,Liberal,WubbaLubbaDubStep

5cdarx,"If you're a liberal and you voted for third party or not voted at all, especially in swing or close states, you also share the blame. Please stop trying to scapegoat out of the responsibility for your choice.","I've seen a lot of liberals scapegoating this as it's because of Hillary or the DNC rigged it against Bernie or if Bernie was it we'd win. I get that and understand where it is coming from. 

The reality though was that on 11/8/2016, there were two Presidential candidates: one being the personification of everything liberal were against and the other candidate being the less than ideal candidate but would at least protect progressiveness. If you decided to throw away your vote or not vote at all you are also part of the reason for why we have a Republican Legislation, Republican Presidency, and essentially handed over the Supreme Court to conservatives (the biggest lost and damage to the progressive movement). The bigger picture was painted pretty clearly for you: a President that would at least protect the progressive achievements this country has made and obtaining a liberal Supreme Court. 

Own up to your actions and accept the outcome of your choices rather than trying to scapegoat it. 

I am a tad bit biased and angry but my fellow liberals need to understand that this tantrum has costed us dearly. 

edit: I need to make this clear, I am not putting most of the blame on the voters. I mostly blame this on the DNC and Hillary Clinton. At the same time I do not see why the voters I pointed out should be absolve of blame. Those voters, in swing or close states, also played a part in the outcome we got and they should not get a free pass on the blame. 

edit2: So I won't have to repeat myself. Losing this election lost liberals the opportunity to make the Supreme Court lean liberal rather than conservative. Clinton was 4 years at least, Supreme Court is for decades.

On a presidential level, the gdp growth has been 1.8% higher under democratic presidents since 1949 than under republican presidents. That may not seem like a lot, but we’re talking about less than a 4% average here.

cl15ca,A record number of Republicans want to see Trump primaried!,"If Trump doesnt get the GOP nomination, his base will stay home in 2020 and there will be landslide victories for Democrats across the board, not just in the presidential election but in local elections, in a critical year in which new electoral districts will be drawn.

44% of Republicans said they want to see Trump challenged in the Primary... https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/449357-poll-republicans-more-interested-in-a-primary-challenge-to?amp

Say the 10% of Democrats that most passionately want to see Trump humiliated switch party registration to Republican and vote for Governor Weld (the only announced candidate thus far that is running against Trump).

Trump already won’t be on the California ballot unless he decides to release his tax returns. He likely wont be on the New York, Illinois or Washington ballots either. These are large states with lots of delegates that will all be going to Weld.

Could some crossover Dem voters be enough to get Weld the GOP nomination over Trump? Probably not many Republicans will show up to vote in the primaries anyway. And it would be humiliating for Trump not to get his own party’s nomination.

If that succeeds, the hardcore Trump supporters will stay home election day 2020 rather than vote for Weld, essentially guaranteeing a Democratic landslide, likely to down ticket seats as well.

Is this a plausible way to beat Trump, just get all the democrats that most want to see him defeated to register as Republican and vote against him in the primary?

——————
In summary, Trump is already being primaried, by Governor Bill Weld, a prochoice proimmigration  Republican that hates Trump and calls Trump a “raging racist” and who will be in the GOP primary ballot of every single state.

Weld will be getting all the delegates from California and any other states that will require Trump to release his tax returns to be on the primary ballot.

If liberals crossover and vote for Weld in the other state primaries, its possible for Weld to get the nomination instead of Trump(albeit getting enough dems to vote in the GOP primary to give Weld some delegates will be tough).

Even if it doesnt work, its a nice FU to Trump and a way to vote against Trump twice in 2020.

All the MAGAers will stay home in 2020 instead of voting for the guy that called Trump a racist, and Dems win 2020 in a landslide that will lead to downseat pickups as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/cl15ca/a_record_number_of_republicans_want_to_see_trump/,1564732727.0,234,0.93,45,Liberal,MagicVV

4hiwgy,Am I the only Sanders supporter who will gladly accept Clinton as POTUS?,"Seriously. It's so polarized. I either see Clinton supporters who will accept Sanders, Clinton supporters who won't accept Sanders, who Sanders supporters that think that Clinton is the Devil in disguise. Maybe it has to do with the fact that many Sanders supporters are young, white entitled males (such as myself, actually- except without the entitled part, less than $60,000 a year at my household, and I'm sixteen). It just saddens me to see the left alienate each other in such a way. Both candidates have their faults and merits, and I'm leaning sixty percent Bernie and forty percent Hillary. Is there anything wrong with compromise? With teamwork? That's what a party is all about, after all. The whole thing just paints one big, ugly brush over all Sanders supporters as intolerant, entitled, sexist, racist, selfish young white men. I wasn't just putting on slurs in that previous sentence just to make generalizations. I see those all the time. Maybe not specific, but implicit, like saying that Clinton only wins in really conservative states, or ""The Deep South"", when that is rather racist and dismissive of all the liberals and African-American voters there. After all, Sanders has won his share of conservative states, as long as they didn't have a significant Latino or African-American population. And of course I don't think the rest has to be elaborated; the insults against Hillary reek of sexism and entitlement. 

I'm actually wondering if it's hurting Sanders, the way I see so many of his supporters act. To be sure, it saddens me, the way they have become the face of the Sanders campaign and his support.

I just wish that we could present a united front. Sanders has said, after all, that he would throw his support behind Clinton if she were to be the nominee.

By far the worst thing I have seen is when people say that if Sanders doesn't win, they will abstain. Almost as worse is when they say they will support Trump. I have trouble wrapping my head around it, to be honest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/4hiwgy/am_i_the_only_sanders_supporter_who_will_gladly/,1462212164.0,52,0.63,344,Liberal,[deleted]

44u8km,How Liberals have been changing my viewpoint,"I wanted to share my experience, because to me it highlights an important difference that I've been seeing between Liberal and Conservative groups.  First off, I've been pretty much a lifelong Republican - straight (R) down the ticket.  As such, I've never been shy about debating or criticizing points from the Left that I've disagreed with.  I've always tried to be reasonable and respectful, but I've always believed that you can't improve your opinion if you aren't willing to put it up against one that's different.

Over the past decade or so, though, I've been growing increasingly dissatisfied both with Republican policies and candidates.  With that, I've been much more likely to debate or criticize points from the Right that I disagree with.  

The result? Over Twitter, reddit, and various other forums and social media, I've been banned or blocked by Conservatives at least 6+ times that I know of.  Not for trolling, just civil, respectful messages where I'm disagreeing.  In the same timeframe (or longer), I don't think I've *ever* been banned or blocked from a Liberal forum.  In fact, I've ended up having some very interesting, very informative discussions, and I've come away with what I feel is a more solid point of view.

From a higher level, I see that same willingness (or unwillingness) to discuss ideas in elected officials from the respective parties.  This is one of the biggest reasons I'm finding myself supporting and voting Democratic instead of Republican lately. As much as I might disagree with some of the Democratic policies, there seems to be much more willingness to actually engage in (some form of) constructive discussion of the ideas.  There's an willingness, or at least *more* of a willingness to consider alternatives or, even if not, a willingness to help me understand _why_ not.

So yeah, to the groups and individuals that I've talked to - thank you for helping change my view.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/44u8km/how_liberals_have_been_changing_my_viewpoint/,1454981989.0,104,0.94,63,Liberal,manatorn

42nhab,It's started! OBAMA IS TAKING AWAY OUR GUNS! IT HAPPENED TO ME!,"
There I was, sitting at home loving America and not making cakes for gay weddings, when I heard a knock on my door.
“Who is it” I asked, expecting my order of a quintuple cheeseburger and freedom fries but no, without answering Obama himself, wearing a pimp coat made entirely of white people’s tax dollars kicked in my door with a furious “Allahu Akbar!”
Then he was all like “I’m here… uh… for the guns? Where… uh… are you keeping them, infidel?”
I said, “Go away Obama! Guns are there to prevent tyranny!”
He simply gave the most Muslim smile he could and said “Uh… yeah, I know! That’s… uh… why I’m taking them!”
Then he reached up on top of my trophy case, took both the Flamethrower I use for home protection and the rocket launcher I hunt hummingbirds with. He even tipped over the bookshelf holding all my Ann Coulter books as well as my Bernie Sanders dartboard, then leapt out the window saying “Enjoy Sharia Law. Obama awayyyyy”
The next day I got a burqa in the mail attached with planned parenthood abortion gift certificate.

3xdyau,"Am I missing something, or is Clinton's campaign overtly and obviously lying about this Sanders ""data breach""?","I'll preface this post with the context that for anyone who doesn't know, [Clinton's campaign got the DNC to suspend Sander's campaigns access to VAN (the Voter Activation Network) which is devastating.](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/18/sanders-campaign-disciplined-for-breaching-clinton-data/) It makes it pretty impossible to host events or contact supporters, etc., etc. VAN is a database of voter and volunteer information, anytime you see someone calling a list or mailing information at a democratic event, they're using a list printed out from VAN. ([Here's a screenshot from some old training pdf I had to use a few times.](http://imgur.com/LHMgASD)) Anyone who’s had Organizing Fellow or above status on the Obama campaign, or any democratic campaign after Obama was elected and standardized Howard Dean's shitty system, has used VAN extensively. 


**I’ve used and trained people on VAN and I'm extremely confused as the idea that the Sanders campaign harvested data from Clinton’s campaign to gain some meaningful advantage seems like COMPLETE bullshit.**


From everything I've seen, pretty much the entire point of VAN is to serve as a database wherein it’s (relatively) easy to see, but immensely difficult to export the data. (I.e., it's easy to set a target door knocking 'universe' or also target groups based on a percentage likelihood the voter will exhibit a certain characteristic and then pull up a contact list for them; But very difficult to export the raw data of every time Jane Doe shopped at whole foods of an entire state or county and email it to someone--which is info the campaign pays for and only interacts with VAN tangentially rather than supporter activity things like event attendance the staffer or volunteer puts into VAN itself).


Every account has a specific set of permissions, activity is logged, and any account you create can be set to auto delete after a set number of days. Moreover, I had to use my regional data coordinator’s VAN account for a day because he couldn’t give access privileges to mine for a very specific task, and unless there was some higher access privileges than the regional data coordinator (there’s not--you can clearly see in the username list exactly what privileges you, or any other user account, have or don’t have access to), I don’t understand how one Sanders staffer would be able to meaningfully save or export that data other than as cumbersome pdf’s or excel spreadsheets. 


And beyond just how prohibitively difficult to work with those formats are for the type and amount of data they’d want from clinton’s campaign, I’m fairly certain VAN has limits on the sheer size of data you can export at one time (for that very reason).


To me it simply sounds like a campaign staffer got an account assigned to the Clinton campaigns permission set. (Generally all accounts have access to [at least two 'committees,'](http://imgur.com/Mdlw2sT) your individual campaign file by state or nationally, and the general DNC information your campaign paid for.)

**This is three years ago, so fundamental aspects of the program may have changed, and honestly I haven't used VAN since 2013 so my memory may be really off, but I really don't understand how the Clinton camp can get away with crippling Sander's entire campaign over something so minor. The idea that a brief access to VAN permissions in any significant way advantaged Sander’s campaign over Clinton’s seems completely ludicrous.**


Someone please chime in and explain this to me because I'm absolutely confused. I'm not a particularly large Bernie supporter, but **the idea that Clinton's campaign can effectively end the campaign of her closest challenger, and undermine the democratic process, over almost literally nothing, infuriates me.**

They're so afraid of terrorists that they'll let widows and orphans die in the Mediterrannean Sea rather than risk it.,"Let's stop beating around the bush and call these GOP Governors and candidates what they are: cowards. The point of terrorism is to use fear to change someone's actions. Apparently it's working on Republicans. They're so afraid of ISIS they won't let innocent women and children into this country on the off chance that some scary terrorists might get in. The French are braver than the GOP; days after a terrorist attack and they're saying they want three times as many refugees as the US has agreed to. They should be ashamed of themselves, and liberals should be using that word and holding their feet to the fire.

3kmgsm,New here. I don't mean to this subreddit. I mean to liberalism.,"Wanted to share with you guys my new found political ideology. I'm 39 years old...I know, a little older than the standard redditer. My first election was 1996 and I voted for Bob Dole. Then Bush. And even McCain and Romney
I'm the father of a 17 year old. He's a great son and about 2 years ago he came out as gay. I was working at the time for the Republican Party. I had worked tirelessly for years to ban marriage equality. And when my son came out I felt ashamed. I love him and support him, but I realized that I couldn't continue to do what I was doing and be truly supportive. So I left my job at the party. 
At first I thought I could be a Rob Portman/Dick Cheney Republican: agree with the party on everything else except marriage and be ok. Then I started to question abortion rights. Then gun laws. Then income inequality. Pretty soon, every conservative value I held on to so dear I was questioning. I realized about 6 months ago that I was no longer even a moderate Republican. So I switched to no party on my registration. Then Bernie Sanders came on the scene. And I fell in love with the man's views and realized that this was the guy for me. I'm still registered no party because I find myself even more left than the Democratic Party on certain issues. I regret my former positions and am embarrassed and deeply sorry that I supported such oppressive ideas. I'm now proudly liberal, working for a local Democrat elected official, and my son will be registering to  vote on his 18th bday next week-he told me he'll be proud that his first ever vote will be Bernie. That makes two of us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/3kmgsm/new_here_i_dont_mean_to_this_subreddit_i_mean_to/,1442026503.0,64,0.89,24,Liberal,MidwestMike2015

Up until the Regan tax cuts in 1986, the income tax rate for the highest bracket was around 70%. And it was at this rate since the 1940’s (it was 90% in the 40’s!). This is based off the ability-to-pay principle and it’s how this country has been running things since the ’20s.

It’s hysterical to me that people seem to think the richest Americans are only just now getting taxed more. If anything, they are being given a HUGE break, because for 46 years, they were taxed at rates as high as 70%… And guess what? Our economy was never better then.

An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ""Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?""

The serious answer: Here’s what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't...

That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine.""

That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem.""

That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue.""

That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, ""He sure knows me.""

That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, ""That's cool!""

That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.

That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?""

That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense.""

That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!""

That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!""

That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!""

That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be.""

That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!""

That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!""

That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense.""

That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, ""falling in love"" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, ""That's statesmanship!""

That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids. has opened a tent city incarceration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they’re just “animals” - and you say, “well, ok then.”

That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.

What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable.

Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.

bk77e8,I just spent the last few hours reading through conservative and far-right message boards. It's too disturbing for words.,"I thought I was familiar with the alt-right's lunacy, but reading through their message boards today puts into perspective how dangerous they are. I'm legitimately baffled by some of the stuff I read today.

They all seem to be waiting for the excuse to start killing people. They seem to want a civil war. They actively talk about sieges, battle tactics, and how to deal with leftists when the fighting breaks out. They detail how the southern states will drive the armies in the coastal cities towards the sea, pin them against the shore and annihilate them. One person talked about killing everyone who isn't a conservative Christian. From reading the comments it seems like a large amount of semi-normal conservatives are starting to lean into extremist views and ideologies. It's spreading.

The thing that makes this all the more scary is that they legitimately think they are victims who need to defend and preserve something. They think they are warriors who will be martyred after they die ""fighting for America"". Their personalities are rooted in ""white identity"" or ""Proud American"" and they are ready to kill the people they perceive as threats. They think the Dems want open borders because it's a Jewish conspiracy to replace the white race and put brown people in power.

This scares me. These people terrify me. There's so many of them and they all plot and plan in their corners of the internet. Many of them are armed and would probably actually kill given the excuse. We've seen the rise in white supremacist hate crimes and it doesn't seem to be getting better. These are terrorists in the making.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/bk77e8/i_just_spent_the_last_few_hours_reading_through/,1556881820.0,279,0.86,179,Liberal,HayleyKJ

Most high school grads are not ready for college immediately.  I think making trades such as welding, machining, A/C repair, etc more available. is a win/ win for everyone.  From what I understand it will cost $60 billion over 10 years, so $6 billion a year with the federal government absorbing 75% of that cost, and states picking up the remaining 25%.  This would lead to a better paid workforce, which in the long run would lead to more tax revenue, without necessarily having to raise taxes.  My only request would be that the president find the funding without having to raise taxes, i.e. ""pay as you go"".  

P.S. I'm a community college grad and I make well over $60,000 a year.

I am a Conservative. This is a scary and strange place for me. However, I have an idea that I would like to put out there.

I'm not sure if this already exists but I thought it might be really interesting and productive if we could create a sub-reddit that was for bipartisan solutions. I would imagine it to be a place where the left and the right start with an idea or problem, discuss each others concerns or ""must haves"" and try to compose a solution that satisfies both sides. Since no one in DC seems to be able to do this, I thought we could give it a shot. If we came up with something good, we could all send it to our leaders. Let me know what you think! and........ugh.......con.....congratulations......you won..... 

Edit: Thanks for the awesome feed back guys. Someone below has created the sub-reddit. Please go check it out and lets get some ideas going. I think the first step would be to pick our starting issue. One that would be fairly easy to compromise on. Any ideas? Put them in the sub-reddit. Thanks!

&gt;Gov. Romney: But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is **every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.** No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier.

&gt;If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because **there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.**


So people earning less than $200k per year will not see any taxes AT ALL on interest, dividends, and capital gains. My question is: don't many people live off of these things and thus they don't have an income?

10oglu,TIL that I am not a Libertarian,"I have been struggling for a while trying to determine which political philosophy best describes my personal philosophy.

I started with conservativism because I was raised fairly conservative and am a Christian. I decided to determine where they stand on several key issues. The way I see the current conservative views are as follows: (foriegn affairs) interventionalist, (economic policy) Raegan style top-down economics, (social) racist/sexist/homhobic--and using the Bible to support these views. Well, that didn't cut it for me.

So I went on to look at Libertarians, they support gay rights and are non-interventionalist, right? Well, I was finally able to wrap my mind around the ideas of Libertarianism and they kind of scared the shit out of me. Did you know that they support a system of governance whereby the free-market controls EVERYTHING? Basically, many libertarians are anti-tax, anti-regulation, and believe that the free market and enterprise will be able to effectively regulate itself. Taxes used to build infrastructure are wrong (nay, theft!), taxes used to educate the populace are THEFT!, and taxes used for really anything that government does are theft. This is completely insane.

TL;DR: I now realize that I am a ""crazy Liberal"" because I believe top-down economics doesn't work, because I believe people should have freedom over their bodies, and because I believe that some level of government spending and regulation (schools, infrastructure, etc.) are absolutely necessary to the functioning of a modern economy.

105chj,Here are my Republican-style reasons for voting for Obama this election.,"So I've only recently become involved in politics, and the first thing I noticed about MANY republican sources is that rhetoric seems to be very much a part of their M.O. I've noticed that they come to these INSANE conclusions from things that are hardly even related. I also noticed there is A LOT of unfair hype against Obama, and how he's a Muslim, atheist, foreign-born, drug using, communist, fascist who wants to take over America and rule/destroy/reign master over all at once. 

According to the kind of logic I have learned from Fox News and other sources, I have compiled a list of reasons why I will vote for Obama this election:

Reasons I'm voting for Obama:
He cured cancer.
He adopted every orphan in the world.
He thinks my hair style is nice.
He's quarterback for the New Orleans Saints.

Please spread the word so that people can know what a wonderful person Obama is.

Because we elect Presidents based not only for their skill sets, but also according to how we feel about them in the office, how they reflect our values and what we think each one will be able to teach younger generations as our country's top role model.  In fact, it can be argued personal character is the *main* reason most Presidents win election.  And character is as evident in our adolescence as it is relevant in the White House.

[Today in the *Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop), Romney's former prep school classmates - ""who gave their accounts independently of one another"" - recounted his attitude and dealings with a student who was presumed to be gay.

&gt; John Lauber, a soft-spoken new student one year behind Romney, was perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality. Now he was walking around the all-boys school with bleached-blond hair that draped over one eye, and Romney wasn’t having it.

&gt; “He can’t look like that. That’s wrong. Just look at him!” an incensed Romney told Matthew Friedemann, his close friend in the Stevens Hall dorm, according to Friedemann’s recollection. Mitt, the teenaged son of Michigan Gov. George Romney, kept complaining about Lauber’s look, Friedemann recalled.

&gt; A few days later, Friedemann entered Stevens Hall off the school’s collegiate quad to find **Romney marching out of his own room ahead of a prep school posse shouting about their plan to cut Lauber’s hair.** Friedemann followed them to a nearby room where **they came upon Lauber, tackled him and pinned him to the ground. As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears, screamed for help, Romney repeatedly clipped his hair with a pair of scissors.**

Critics of the article may point out this paragraph:

&gt; The men have differing political affiliations, although they mostly lean Democratic. Buford volunteered for Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008. Seed, a registered independent, has served as a Republican county chairman in Michigan. All of them said that politics in no way colored their recollections.

However, all five of those interviewed are today successful, professional men (a dentist, a lawyer, a retired prosecutor and a retired principal, along with a fifth man who asked to remain anonymous), and as previously noted, spoke of their recollections independently.  Five witnesses, speaking separately, all saying the same thing.

&gt; “It was a hack job,” recalled Maxwell, a childhood friend of Romney who was in the dorm room when the incident occurred. “It was vicious.”

&gt; The incident transpired in a flash, and Friedemann said **Romney then led his cheering schoolmates** back to his bay-windowed room in Stevens Hall. 

&gt; Friedemann, guilt ridden, made a point of not talking about it with his friend and waited to see what form of discipline would befall Romney at the famously strict institution. **Nothing happened.**

This is the guy running for our President.  A coldhearted, homophobic bully.  And he wants to lead our nation.

If character matters in the White House, few revelations (particularly coming on the heels of North Carolina's Amendment One vote and President Obama's coming out in favor gay marriage) can shed more light on who Mitt Romney really is.

nf48x,Go ahead and hate me for this.,"I get the whole, ""Support our troops"" thing. Really, I do. But I don't think every individual deserves praise all the time.

I was just chatting with an old friend who is in the service right now. He was telling me all about how funny it is that people make comments like, ""Let's curb stomp all the liberal faggots,"" and, ""We should drive a tank over the whole lot of them,"" (in reference to a bunch of tied up occupiers lying facedown on the pavement). He also informed me of the hysterics of a picture of a woman who was severely bruised and bloodied with a caption that read, ""Dumb bitch. Last time she ever makes me a sandwich with beef when I asked for ham."" I lost my cool and argued with him a bit and told him that those things were hugely offensive, and a third party (yes, unfortunately this was on Facebook) decided to cut into our argument to add, ""What we all should be doing..... is thanking andrew here for his service, so thank you."" WTF?? Are you fucking kidding me?!

This kid literally spends 12 hours a day on Facebook and apparently searching the internet for this ridiculous crap. Yeah, real fucking heroic, bro. I'm sorry I decided against starting off every conversation with my sincerest thanks for wasting our tax dollars in order to breed a culture of hate. It's like you can never say anything to a soldier other than to thank them for their service without being antagonized to no end.

You know what, bud? I'm not sorry. And I don't care if you never forgive me for that. I cannot respect you.

I may not have been shipped halfway across the world, but I fight my battles here at home every day. I can GUARANTEE I've changed more lives than you have. Just because I don't have a convenient badge I can use to flaunt it doesn't mean that you are any better than I am. While you're busy Googling racist jokes and finding new ways to insult women, I'm out protecting the people I care about. I fight for the future of education, for reproductive justice, for equality for all. And I don't require a paycheck to do so. But you don't see me posting fucking spam every day about how grateful everyone should be that I'm around.

* Conservative courts uphold Obama healthcare reform

* Republican Rep Joe Walsh totally loses it at one of his events

* Herman Cain makes an ass out of himself and the Republican Party today

* Herman Cain says he’s not dropping out of the race (Best news ever!)

* Kentucky Democratic Governor cruises to a win in today’s elections

* Romney says he was right to when he said let Detroit go bankrupt

* Michele Bachmann says we should add three more heads to Mt. Rushmore

* Mississippi defeats life at conception bill

* Maine defeats GOP’s attempt to eliminate same day voter registration 

* GOP seems to be panicking about super-committee negotiations. Already blaming dems for the failure they know they will achieve

* On a sad note: Nancy Grace was voted off “Dancing With The Stars.”

**The Democratic Party and other interested groups need to hire a team of professional investigators and lawyers.** These people can gather all of the evidence and testimony from witnesses and involved parties. They can talk to witnesses willing to talk and get their statements.  They can include This any information and testimony made public from the FBI's investigation.   


**An experienced team can organize all of this evidence in one document that can be presented to the public.** It should be published online in PDF format so that anyone can read this report.  

Please tell me this is happening. I hope there people with vision and leadership within the Party or other organizations that are making this happen.  We need to have the evidence in one place, compiled and organized, and available to the public.

- Who is doing this?  
- Pelosi, will your office offer this to the public?   
- Can we identify who is doing this or determine that no one is doing this?

&gt;In Austria you pay 7.74 % of your income for healthcare. 3.78 % the employee and 3.78% the employer.

&gt;This is part of the social security payments and those are capped if you earn more than 71,820.00 € a year. So nobody will ever pay more than 5,558.86 € a year for healthcare.

&gt;**The median working person in Austria pays 1,974.17 € a year for heathcare throug taxes.**

&gt;Also: Your country spent 1634 billion on Medicaid and Medicare in 2017. The USA has a population of 325.7 million. This means that **the avverage US Person pays already 5,016.88 $ a year for healthcare through taxes!**

&gt;https://budget.house.gov/budget-digest/fiscal-year-2018-budget-sustaining-medicare-medicaid/

&gt;So... **there isn't a single person who works in Austria who pays more for healthcare through taxes than a person who works in the USA.** And than you still have to buy private insurance (or your employer has to buy it for you which is essential the same). WTF. just WTF.

&gt;You could decrease taxes if you adopt single payer.

They could have worked with Democrats back then, gotten 60 votes and not needed them now. But again, they made a choice.

7mpxtu,#7 on my list of Top 10 American Political Evils: Twojobism,"Here's one from my family over the holidays, which I call ""twojobism"": it's where you can't cite any facts to back up your political beliefs, because you're way too busy bustin' your ass, but you're sure you could if you weren't working two jobs.

Trump fans love to state many ""facts"" about their repugnant hero, e.g. ""he's gotten more done in his first year than Obama did in eight years!"".  But if you ask ""what?"" they can usually list SC (his incredible feat getting a conservative justice approved by a conservative Congress) and ""tax reform"" (written and approved by a majority Republican Congress, merely signed by the President).  What else?  ""I don't have time to read all the papers and watch all the different networks -- I'm working two jobs!  When I get off work from the supermarket, I just have time to watch a half-hour of Fox News before I have to go to sleep to get up 6 AM to work at the coffee shop!  If I had more time, I know I could list a dozen great things he's accomplished!  I'm sure of it!""

And so, because of Twojobism, 25-30% of the US voting public believes not what the facts indicate, but what would most validate their emotions, and the US slides into the toilet of history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/7mpxtu/7_on_my_list_of_top_10_american_political_evils/,1514499854.0,71,0.85,11,Liberal,[deleted]

It's not difficult to imagine the same attitudes and words filled Germany in 1930s.

7htaqc,"Even amongst prison inmates, pedophilia is perceived to be the most disgusting of crimes. Yet Roy Moore is still supported by the GOP","It's commonly known by those who are familiar with the prison system that people who have committed sex crimes against children are the inmates who have the most difficult time. Ostracized, often faced with physical abuse from inmates who view their actions as heinous and detestable, many eventually commit suicide in prison. [(source)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/prison-living-hell-pedophiles/story?id=90004)

Cue Roy Moore. Not only have many 'Alabamians' doubled-down on Moore over a Democratic candidate, but the RNC has actually reversed their initial rejection of the accused candidate, and continue to fund his campaign. While I support due process in a court of law, enough substantial evidence has been provided to reasonably question Moore's fitness for public office. If I were a Republican official (especially in the current climate of sexual harassment of the past couple months), I'd want to distance my party as far as possible from the highly plausible accusations against Moore. This Faustian deal of endorsing Moore to maintain the GOP majority and pass their haphazardly constructed legislation further proves to me that even society's worst, America's criminals, will condemn a pedophile before a ""scrupulous"" Republican if votes are at stake. Sexual behavior with an adolescent or younger is predatory, wrong, and illegal, whether your name is Milo Yiannopoulos, Kevin Spacey, or Judge Roy Moore. If so many Republicans have the guile to say homosexuality is immoral, but won't stand against the sexual misconduct of their peers, then when will the GOP stop being identified as the party of moral, Christian, family values?
