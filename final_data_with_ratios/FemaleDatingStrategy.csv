qkkowc,Porn users will always be NVM,"In case you were wondering why porn is so terrible, other than the obvious (his limp dick energy, obsession with anal, and daily infidelity with thousands of other women), here's a brief list. This is research largely copied from [https://antiporn-activist.tumblr.com/newmasterpost](https://antiporn-activist.tumblr.com/newmasterpost), and I'll be adding more research from various sources. Some of the studies are pre internet or Big Porn - every man is now massively exposed to violent hardcore pornography, throughout the day (men often look at porn to procrastinate, much like a normal person checks social media.) Porn users will always be 100% undateable, NEVER give one a chance, and please don't waste your energy trying to recuperate him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since the 1950s, the distribution and availability of pornography has become increasingly normalized. Pornography exposure among college males is now almost universal. Boys and men are consuming hardcore pornography, which may include depictions of sex with persons who look like children, teens, scenarios portraying incest, and other paraphilic interests such as sex with animals (i.e. zoophilia), excretory activities (i.e. coprophilia/urophilia), and violence against women, including rape (i.e. biastophilia) and torture (i.e. algolania) Today ‚Äú‚Ä¶ mainstream commercial pornography has coalesced around a relatively homogenous script involving violence and female degradation.‚Äù (Sun)

&amp;#x200B;

## Porn and its Psychological Effects

* In 1982 and 1984, Dr. Dolf Zillmann and Dr. Jennings Bryant conducted an experiment with 80 male and 80 female college-age participants. 101 These were divided into three subgroups, and each group was shown **4 hours and 48 minutes of media over a six-week period**: (1) the ‚ÄúMassive Exposure Group‚Äù was shown 36 non-violent pornographic film clips; (2) the ‚ÄúIntermediate Exposure Group‚Äù was exposed to 18 pornographic film clips and 18 regular films; and (3) the ‚ÄúNo Exposure‚Äù control group was shown 36 non-pornographic film clips.-
   * **A direct correlation was noticed between the amount of pornography one viewed and one‚Äôs overall sexual satisfaction.**
   * Participants from the **Massive Exposure Group reported less satisfaction with their intimate partner, such as their partner‚Äôs physical appearance, affection, and sexual performance**. Researchers concluded, ‚Äúconsumers eventually **compare appearance and performance of pornographic models with that of their intimate partners**, and this comparison rarely favors their intimate partners.‚Äù
   * Those exposed to more pornography attached more value to casual sex (i.e. sex without emotional involvement).
   * When asked if minors should be protecting from seeing pornography, 84% of the No Exposure Group, 54% of the Intermediate Exposure Group, and 37% of the Massive Exposure Group said yes.
   * **Porn seemed to condition participants to trivialize rape**. Male subjects who were exposed to the massive amounts of pornography (4 hours a week) considered rape a less serious crime than they did before they were exposed to it; they thought that prison sentences for rape should be shorter; and they perceived sexual aggression and abuse as causing less suffering for the victims, **even in the case of an adult male having sexual intercourse with a 12-year-old girl.**
   * Participants were asked to read about a legal case where a man raped a female hitchhiker and then recommend a length for the rapist‚Äôs prison sentence. Males in the No Exposure Group said 94 months; the Massive Exposure Group said 50 months (nearly half that of the No Exposure Group).
   *  **Acceptance of male dominance in intimate relationships.** A marked increase in males‚Äô acceptance of male dominance in intimate relationships was yet another result of this massive exposure to pornography The notion that women are, or ought to be, equal in intimate relationships was more likely to be abandoned by these male subjects.
   * Participants were asked to rate their overall **support for women‚Äôs rights. Both men and women who were in the Massive Exposure Group showed significant drops in support** compared to the No Exposure Group. There was 71% male support in the No Exposure Group compared to 25% in the Massive Exposure Group and 82% female support in the No Exposure Group compared to 52% in the Massive Exposure Group.
   *  **Callous attitudes toward female sexuality.** Male sexual callousness toward women was significantly enhanced. For example, they became increasingly accepting of statements such as ‚ÄúA woman doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äòno‚Äô until she slaps you‚Äù; ‚ÄúA man should find them, fool them, fuck them, and forget them‚Äù; and ‚ÄúIf they are old enough to bleed, they are old enough to butcher.‚Äù 
   * When asked how common or popular certain sexual activities were in the general population ‚Äî activities like **anal sex, group sex, sadomasochism, and bestiality** ‚Äî the percentages given by the Massive Exposure Group were two to three times higher than the No Exposure Group.
   * The **Massive Exposure Group was far more likely to believe women fit the stereotype** of the women they see in pornographic films ‚Äî that is, ‚Äú**socially non-discriminating, as hysterically euphoric in response to just about any sexual or pseudosexual stimulation, and as eager to accommodate seemingly any and every sexual request**.‚Äù
   * Additionally, two weeks after they stopped seeing videos, all participants were given an assortment of pornographic and non-pornographic films to watch in private. Those who were exposed to more pornography were **significantly more likely to want to watch hardcore porn.**

&amp;#x200B;

* In a 2002 study, 71 male undergraduate students were divided into 3 groups. Each group watched 10-11-minute video segments: (1) a sexually-explicit and degrading film, (2) a sexually-explicit educational film, and (3) a non-sexual film. Later the men were placed side-by-side with a woman in a seemingly unrelated social experiment.
   * Viewers of the sexually-explicit film displayed more dominance and anxiety, ignored contributions of their partner more often, touched their partner for longer periods of time, and averted their partner‚Äôs gaze more compared to viewers of the non-sexual film.
   * Viewers of the sexually-explicit and degrading film spent longer periods of time averting their partner‚Äôs touch and gazing at their partner‚Äôs face, interrupted their partner more, advanced to touch their partner more, and made more sexual references compared to viewers of the sexually-explicit film.

&amp;#x200B;

* Studies show that after viewing pornography men are more likely to:-

1. report decreased empathy for rape victims-
2. have increasingly aggressive behavioral tendencies-
3. report believing that a woman who dresses provocatively deserves to be raped
4. report anger at women who flirt but then refuse to have sex
5. report decreased sexual interest in their girlfriends or wives
6. report increased interest in coercing partners into unwanted sex acts

(Bridges, 2006) (Yang, Gahyun, 2012).

&amp;#x200B;

* In a meta-analysis of 46 studies published from 1962 to 1995, comprising a total sample of 12,323 people, researchers concluded pornographic material puts one at increased risk of:-
   * developing sexually deviant tendencies -  31% increase in risk
   *  committing sexual offences - 22% increase in risk 
   * accepting rape myths - 31% increase in risk 

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2005, a study of youth between the ages of 10 and 17 concluded that there is a significant **relationship between frequent porn use and feelings of loneliness and major depression.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Gary R. Brooks, Ph.D., describes what he observes as a ‚Äúpervasive disorder‚Äù linked to the consumption of soft- core pornography like Playboy. He mentions five main symptoms of this:
   * (1) **Voyeurism**: An obsession with looking at women rather than interacting with them. This can apply to far more than pornography, including any consumption of the ‚Äúsexuality-on-tap‚Äù culture in which we live; media glorifies and objectifies women‚Äôs bodies, thus promoting unreal images of women, feeding male obsession with visual stimulation and trivializing other mature features of a healthy sexual relationship.
   * (2) **Objectification**: An attitude in which women are objects rated by size, shape and harmony of body parts. Sexual fantasy leads to emotional unavailability and dissatisfaction
   * (3) **Validation**: The need to validate masculinity through beautiful women. Women who meet centerfold standards only retain their power as long as they maintain ‚Äúperfect‚Äù bodies and the lure of unavailability; it is very common for a man‚Äôs fantasy sexual encounter to include a feeling of manly validation; it is also common for men to feel invalidated by their wives if they have trained their minds and bodies to respond only to the fantasy advances of their dream girl.
   * (4) **Trophyism**: The idea that beautiful women are collectibles who show the world who a man is. Pornography reinforces the women‚Äôs-bodies-as-trophies mentality.
   * (5) **Fear of True Intimacy**: Inability to relate to women in an honest and intimate way despite deep loneliness. Pornography exalts a man‚Äôs sexual needs over his need for sensuality and intimacy; some men develop a preoccupation with sexuality, which powerfully handicaps their capacity for emotionally intimate relationships.  

* Pornography increases the acceptability of sexism. As Van White points out, ‚Äúby using pornography, by looking at other human beings as a lower form of life, they \[the pornographers\] are perpetuating the same kind of hatred that brings racism to society‚Äù (1984).
* ‚Äú**Prolonged exposure to pornography, it must be remembered, results in both a loss of respect for female sexual autonomy and the disinhibition of men in the expression of aggression against women**.‚Äù - Dr. James B. Weaver.  


## Porn and Addiction

* 10% of adults admit to having an addiction to online pornography (IFR, 2006).
* In a survey of 63 wives of self-identified sex addicts:
   *  70% met most criteria for a diagnosis of **post-traumatic stress disorder.**
   * 75% discovered evidence of compulsive or addictive sexual behaviors themselves (as opposed to a planned disclosure on the part of a husband)
   * 71% demonstrated a severe level of **functional impairment** in major areas of their lives.
   * Length of marriage at disclosure and number of prior traumatic event exposures were the best predictors of increased trauma symptoms.
* ‚Äú\[M\]odern science allows us to understand that the underlying nature of an addiction to pornography is chemically nearly identical to a heroin addiction.‚Äù - Dr. Jeffrey Satinovet
* ‚ÄúPornography triggers a myriad of endogenous, internal, natural drugs that mimic the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô from a street drug. **Addiction to pornography is addiction to what I dub erototoxins**‚Äîmind altering drugs produced by the viewer‚Äôs own brain.‚Äù - Dr. Judith Reisman

&amp;#x200B;

## Porn and Violence, and Rape

* **88.2% of top rated porn scenes contain aggressive acts** principally spanking, gagging, and slapping, while 48.7% of scenes contained verbal aggression, primarily name-calling.
* In 70% of occurrences, **a man is perpetrator of the aggression**; 87% of the time the act is **directed towards a woman**. Open-hand slapping occurs in 41.1% of scenes. 95% of the time the woman's responses were either neutral or expressions of pleasure.
* Only 9.9% of the top selling scenes analysed contained behaviors such as kissing, laughing, caressing, or verbal compliments. Sex depicted in porn movies generally f**ocuses on men‚Äôs sexual pleasure and orgasm**, rather than equally that of women‚Äôs (Bridges and Wosnitzer, 2007)
* A 2015 meta-analysis of 22 studies from seven countries found that internationally the **consumption of pornography was significantly associated with increases in verbal and physical aggression,** among males and females alike.
* Among perpetrators of sex crimes, adolescent exposure to pornography is a significant predictor of elevated violence and victim humiliation.
* In a study of 30 college fraternity members on a small liberal arts campus, the displayed images of women (in posters, screensavers, calendars, pin-ups, and advertisements) were analyzed for their frequency and degrading nature. **There was a significant association between the average degradation ratings of the images and the student‚Äôs rape-supportive attitude scale** (RSA).
* In a study of 187 **female university students,** researchers concluded **early exposure to pornography was related to subsequent ‚Äúrape fantasies‚Äù** and attitudes supportive of sexual violence against women. Researchers believe pornography consumed at a young age contributes to **women being socialized to accept sexual aggression as a sexual/romantic** event.
* A study of 14- to 19-year-olds found that females who watched pornographic videos were at significantly greater likelihood of being victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault.
* In 2004 data was collected from interviews with 271 women participating in a battered women‚Äôs program. **Pornography use by their partner significantly increased the odds of women being sexually abused by their abusers**. When their abuser used both alcohol and pornography, the odds of sexual abuse increase by a factor of 3.2.
* Some pornography consumers use pornography to build sexual excitement in advance of purchasing sex from prostituted persons; others seek to reenact pornographic scenes on prostituted persons. An analysis of 101 sex buyers, compared to 100 men who did not buy sex, found that sex buyers masturbate to pornography more often than non-sex buyers, masturbate to more types of pornography, and reported that their sexual preferences changed so that they sought more sadomasochistic and anal sex. Other research also demonstrates an association between purchase of commercial sex acts and pornography use
* A Swedish study of 18-year-old males found that frequent users of pornography were significantly more likely to have sold and bought sex than other boys of the same age
* Arrested prostitution clients are twice as likely to report having watched pornographic movies over the past year than a national sample.
* In a study of 804 Italian adolescents, ages 14 to 19 years old, viewing pornography was correlated to both active and passive sexual violence and unwanted sex.
* ‚ÄúWomen are represented as passive and as slavishly dependent upon men. **The role of female characters is limited to the provision of sexual services to men**. To the extent that women‚Äôs sexual pleasure is represented at all, it is subordinated to that of men and is never an end in itself as is the sexual pleasure of men. What pleases women is the use of their bodies to satisfy male desires. While the sexual objectification of women is common to all pornography, women are the recipients of even worse treatment in violent pornography, in which **women characters are killed, tortured, gang-raped, mutilated, bound, and otherwise abused, as a means of providing sexual stimulation or pleasure to the male characters**.‚Äù - Helen Longino
* Research indicates that 25% to 30% of male college students in the United States and Canada **admit that there is some likelihood they would rape a woman if they could get away with it.** (Briere and Malamuth, 1983)
* In her study of male sexuality, Shere Hite found that 67% of the males who admitted that they had wanted to rape a woman reported reading pornographic magazines, compared to only 19% of those who said that they had never wanted to rape a woman (1981, p. 1123). With regard to the frequency of exposure to pornography, Hite reported that only 11% of the 7,000 males she surveyed said that they had never looked at pornography; 36% said they viewed it regularly, 21% said they did so sometimes, 26% said they did so infrequently, and 6% said that they had looked at it in the past.
* In a study of high school males, 50% of those interviewed believed it **acceptable ‚Äúfor a guy to hold a girl down and force her to have sexual intercourse in instances such as when ‚Äòshe gets him sexually excited‚Äô or ‚Äòshe says she‚Äôs going to have sex with him and then changes her mind‚Äô‚Äù** (Goodchilds and Zellman, 1984)
* Non-violent heterosexual porn often becomes ‚Äòtoo boring‚Äô and leads (commonly) men to seek out more ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô and ‚Äòexciting‚Äô types of pornography: often including abuse and rape. (Zillman and Bryant) (Briere and Malamuth)
* Japanese males were divided into three groups and each exposed to different types of home video pornography: a positive rape film (where the female expressed pleasure), a negative rape film (where the female expressed pain), or a consenting sex film. T**hose who viewed the positive rape film were significantly more likely to state that women could enjoy rape** **and higher percentages of rape cases are invented by victims.**
* In an 1985 experiment specifically designed to study desensitization, to rape, Linz, Donnerstein, and Penrod showed ten hours of R-rated or X-rated movies over a period of five days to male subjects. Subjects were preselected  to ensure that they were not psychotic, hostile, or anxious. Some students saw X-rated movies depicting sexual assault; others saw X-rated movies depicting only consenting sex; and a third group saw R-rated sexually violent movies‚Äìfor example, ‚ÄúI Spit on Your Grave,‚Äù ‚ÄúToolbox Murders,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTexas Chainsaw Massacre.‚Äù Donnerstein describes ‚ÄúToolbox Murders‚Äù as follows: There is an erotic bathtub scene in which a woman massages herself. A beautiful song is played. Then a psychotic killer enters with a nail gun. The music stops. He chases the woman around the room, then shoots her through the stomach with the nail gun. She falls across a chair. The song comes back on as he puts the nail gun to her forehead and blows her brains out. **According to Donnerstein, many young males become sexually aroused by this movie.**
   * Donnerstein and Linz described the impact of the R-rated movies on their subjects as follows: ""Initially, after the first day of viewing, the men rated themselves as significantly above the norm for depression, anxiety, and annoyance on a mood adjective checklist. After each subsequent day of viewing, these scores dropped until, on the fourth day of viewing, the males‚Äô levels of anxiety, depression, and annoyance were indistinguishable from baseline norms."" 
   * By the fifth day, the subjects rated the movies as less graphic and less gory and estimated fewer violent or offensive scenes than after the first day of viewing. **They also rated the films as significantly less debasing and degrading to women, more humorous, and more enjoyable, and reported a greater willingness to see this type of film again.** However, **their sexual arousal by this material did not decrease over this five-day period**
   * On the last day, the subjects went to a law school where they saw a documentary re-enactment of a real rape trial. A control group of subjects who had never seen the films also participated in this part of the experiment. Subjects who had seen the R-rated movies: (1) rated the victim as significantly more worthless, (2) rated her injury as significantly less severe, and (3) assigned greater blame to her for being raped than did the subjects who had not seen the film.

&amp;#x200B;

* THE ROLE OF PORNOGRAPHY IN UNDERMINING SOME MALES‚Äô INTERNAL INHIBITIONS AGAINST ACTING OUT THE DESIRE TO RAPE (Russel, The Evidence of Harm)
   * **OBJECTIFYING WOMEN**
      * ‚ÄúIt was difficult for me to admit that I was dealing with a human being when I was talking to a woman,‚Äù one rapist reported, ‚Äúbecause, if you read men‚Äôs magazines, you hear about your stereo, your car, your chick‚Äù. After this rapist had hit his victim several times in her face, she stopped resisting and begged, ‚ÄúAll right, just don‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen she said that,‚Äù he reported, ‚Äúall of a sudden it came into my head, ‚ÄòMy God, this is a human being!‚Äô I came to my senses and saw that I was hurting this person.‚Äù Another rapist said of his victim, ‚ÄúI wanted this beautiful fine thing and I got it‚Äù (Russell, 1975)
      * Dehumanizing oppressed groups or enemy nations in times of war is an important mechanism for facilitating brutal behavior toward members of those groups. However, the dehumanization of women that occurs in pornography is often not recognized because of its sexual guise and its pervasiveness. **It is important to note that the objectification of women is as common in non-violent pornography as it is in violent pornography.**
   * **TRIVILASING RAPE**
      * In an experiment conducted by Neil Malamuth and James Check, one group of college students saw a pornographic depiction in which a woman was portrayed as sexually aroused by sexual violence. **The students who had been exposed to the pornographic depiction of rape were significantly more likely than the students in the control group (1) to perceive the second rape victim as suffering less trauma; (2) to believe that she actually enjoyed it; and (3) to believe that women in general enjoy rape and forced sexual acts** 
      * Male subjects in these studies are more apt to believe after viewing pornography that: ‚Äú**A woman who goes to the home or the apartment of a man on their first date implies that she is willing to have sex‚Äù; ‚ÄúAny healthy woman can successfully resist a rapist if she really wants to‚Äù; ‚ÄúMany women have an unconscious wish to be raped, and many then unconsciously set up a situation in which they are likely to be attacked‚Äù; ‚ÄúIf a girl engages in necking or petting and she lets things get out of hand, it is her own fault if her partner forces sex on her‚Äù** 
      * The boys who were the most frequent consumers of pornography and/or who reported learning a lot from it, were more accepting of rape supportive beliefs than their peers who were less frequent consumers and/or who said they had not learned as much from it.
      * 25% of girls and 57% of boys indicated belief that in one or more situations, it was at least ‚Äúmaybe okay‚Äù for a boy to hold a girl down and force her to have intercourse. Only 21% of the boys and 57% of the girls believed that forced intercourse was ‚Äúdefinitely not okay‚Äù in any of the situations. The situation in which forced intercourse was most accepted, was that in which the girl had sexually excited her date. In this case 43% of the boys and 16% of the girls stated that if was at least ‚Äúmaybe okay‚Äù for the boy to force intercourse
      * According to Donnerstein, ‚ÄúAfter only 10 minutes of exposure to aggressive pornography, particularly material in which women are shown being aggressed against, you find male subjects are much more willing to accept these particular myths‚Äù. These males are also more inclined to believe that 25% of the women they know would enjoy being raped 
   * **ACCEPTANCE OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE.** 
      * Studies have shown that viewing portrayals of sexual violence as having positive consequences increases male subjects‚Äô acceptance of violence against women. Examples of some of the attitudes used to measure acceptance of interpersonal violence include ‚ÄúBeing roughed up is sexually stimulating to many women‚Äù; ‚ÄúSometimes the only way a man can get a cold woman turned on is to use force‚Äù; ‚ÄúMany times a woman will pretend she doesn‚Äôt want to have intercourse because she doesn‚Äôt want to seem loose, but she‚Äôs really hoping the man will force her‚Äù (Briere, Malamuth, and Check, 1985)
      * Malamuth and Check (1981) conducted an experiment in which students were randomly assigned to view either a feature-length film that portrayed violence against women as being justifiable and having positive consequences (‚ÄúSwept Away‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Getaway‚Äù) or a film without sexual violence. The experiment showed that exposure to the sexually violent movies increased the male subjects‚Äô acceptance of interpersonal violence against women. (This outcome did not occur with the female subjects.) These effects were measured several days after the films had been seen.

&amp;#x200B;

* Rapist interviewed by Beneke, 1982: *‚ÄúI went to a porno bookstore, put a quarter in a slot, and saw this porn movie. It was just a guy coming up from behind a girl and attacking her and raping her. That‚Äôs when I started having rape fantasies. When I saw that movie, it was like somebody lit a fuse from my childhood on up‚Ä¶ I just went for it, went out and raped.‚Äù* 
* The following statements were made by women testifying at the Hearings on Pornography in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1993 (Russell, 1993a).
   * Ms. M testified that, *‚ÄúI agree to act out in private a lot of the scenarios that my husband read to me. These depicted bondage and different sexual acts that I found humiliating to do‚Ä¶He read the pornography like a textbook, like a journal. When he finally convinced me to be bound, he read in the magazine how to tie the knots and bind me in a way that I couldn‚Äôt escape. Most of the scenes where I had to dress up or go through different fantasies were the exact same scenes that he has read in the magazines.‚Äù*
   * Ms. O described a case in which a man *‚Äòbrought pornographic magazines, books, and paraphernalia into the bedroom with him and told her that if she did not perform the sexual acts in the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù books and magazines, he would beat her and kill her‚Äô*
   * Ms. S testified about the experience of a group of women prostitutes who, she said, ‚Äò*were forced constantly to enact specific scenes that men had witnessed in pornography‚Ä¶These men‚Ä¶ would set up scenarios, usually with more than one woman, to copy scenes that they had seen portrayed in magazines and books. \[For example, Ms. S quoted a woman in her group as saying:\] ‚ÄúHe held up a porn magazine with a picture of a beaten woman and said, ‚ÄòI want you to look like that. I want you to hurt.‚Äô He then began beating me. When I did not cry fast enough, he lit a cigarette and held it right above my breast for a long time before he burned me.‚Äù*
   * Ms. S. also described what three men did to a nude woman prostitute whom they had tied up while she was seated on a chair: ‚Äú*They burned her with cigarettes and attached nipple clips to her breasts. They had many S and M magazines with them and showed her many pictures of women appearing to consent, enjoy, and encourage this abuse. She was held for twelve hours while she was continuously raped and beaten.‚Äù*
   * Another example cited by Ms. S: *‚ÄúThey (several Johns) forced the women to act simultaneously with the movie. In the movie at this point, a group of men were urinating on a naked woman. All the men in the room were able to perform this task, so they all started urinating on the woman who was now naked.‚Äù*
* ‚ÄúPornography may meet the legal definition of trafficking to the extent that the pornographer recruits, entices, or obtains the people depicted in pornography for the purpose of photographing commercial sex acts.

&amp;#x200B;

## Porn and Child Abuse

* A survey from a general population of Internet pornography users found that users of pornography depicting sexual abuse of children also consume both hardcore pornography (featuring ostensibly adult performers), as well as animal pornography. There were no consumers of child sexual abuse images who only collected child sexual abuse images.
* A study examining 231 Swiss men charged in a 2002 case for possession of child sexual abuse images, found that 60% percent also used pornography that depicted sexual acts with animals, excrement, or brutality; 33% consumed at least three or more types of deviant pornography. Researchers also found that those convicted for possessing child sexual abuse images were more likely to subscribe to commercial websites containing legal (according to Swiss law) pornographic material (19% vs. 4%).  


## Porn and Relationships

* At a gathering of the nation‚Äôs divorce lawyers, attendees revealed that **58% of their divorces were a result of a spouse looking at excessive amounts of pornography online.**
* According to the Journal of Adolescent Health, prolonged exposure to pornography leads to:- An **exaggerated perception of sexual activity** in society- **Diminished trust between intimate couples**\- The abandonment of the hope of sexual monogamy- Belief that promiscuity is the natural state- Belief that abstinence and **sexual inactivity are unhealthy**\- **Cynicism about love** or the need for affection between sexual partners- Belief that marriage is sexually confining- Lack of attraction to family and child-raising
* According to sociologist Jill Manning, the research indicates pornography consumption is associated with the following six trends, among others:

1. Increased **marital distress**, and risk of separation and divorce
2. **Decreased** marital intimacy and **sexual satisfaction**
3. Infidelity
4. **Increased appetite for more graphic types of pornography** and sexual activity associated with **abusive, illegal or unsafe practices**
5. Devaluation of monogamy, marriage and child rearing
6. An increasing number of people struggling with **compulsive and addictive sexual behavior**

* In a survey of women (and some men) who experienced serious adverse consequences from their partner‚Äôs cybersex involvement:- In 68% of the couples, one or both **lost interest in relational sex**: 52% of showed a decreased interest, as did 34% of partners.- Partners commonly reported **feeling hurt, betrayed, rejected, abandoned, lonely, isolated, humiliated, jealous, and angry**.- Partners often **compared themselves unfavorably to online images**.- Partners **overwhelmingly felt that cyber affairs were as emotionally painful as offline affairs**.

I love to re-listen to FDS podcasts. Every single episode is filled with valuable information, systematic analysis of women‚Äôs 2nd class position, porn/sex industry critique, and ruthless assertiveness and boundary setting. I swear, every time I hear these ladies speak, its nothing but the truth and unapologetic female centered strategy. So, I was inspired by an episode, where the girls were making fun of some tweets, from I think feminists, or just women in general saying that having high standards for men when dating was ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù against men that are low value. (hahahaahahahhahahhahah)

First, when men ( or even women) are engaging in this type of rhetoric, be it online or in person (‚Äúgive him a chance/ you‚Äôre not being fair), it reflects how patriarchy positions women to be readily available and willing to allow men access to us. 2nd, that we need to have ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù reasons to consider denying men access to us. If reasons are beyond ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to men, we are breaking a patriarchal rule that is akin to violating a fundamental ‚Äúright‚Äù to them. The right to women. This all stems from male socialization that conditions boys and men to be entitled to women and women‚Äôs emotional labor. That‚Äôs why men find it so abhorrent. That‚Äôs why they become hostile and spew such vitriol when women express standards, their ‚Äúright‚Äù to women is being taken away. So, as a class-conscious group, they‚Äôd rather demean, belittle, name-call, degrade the women that have the courage to speak up on their standards, as to intimidate other women from expressing similar beliefs and keep their access to women open.

I say this in order to prepare you to identify this kind of rhetoric and this kind of thinking online and in person. You will hear: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not fair, you should give him a chance, that‚Äôs outrageous, that‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscriminatory/not right‚Äù against men. You are in no way legaly/socially obligated to make sure your standards fit  any notion of non-discrimination or civil rights policy. You are not a government agency or employer required to give men a fair chance at you. That‚Äôs not how this works. You decide the policy in which a man will enter your life or even be considered for a date. These standards can be as dictatorial, ruthless, unfair, unjust, outrageous, as merciless as you want. Your body, mental and emotional labor, are not subject to external rules of society. They are governed by what will make you happy, bring you material gain and a respectful and adoring partner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q2ni21/you_are_not_an_equal_opportunity_employer_your/,1633536224.0,1205,0.94,50,FemaleDatingStrategy,lakat17

q2jq5b,I'm done with men shorter than me,"So, I'm 5'10 and I met this guy at the art exhibition. He's like 5'7 or something, plus I wear heels most of the time, so a height difference is quite noticeable. But we chatted about some art pieces, discussed our favourite artists and found we have a lot in common, so I gave him my number. We went out a few times, and suddenly he ghosted me. I'm usually an ""out of sight, out of mind"" person, so I didn't even bother with finding out what happened (he posted some stuff on his timeline so it was clear that he's alive and I'm just being ignored). However, he desperately needed me to know what exactly I did ""wrong"", so he sent me some stupid meme about how shallow fEmALeS are and commented on his disappointment because I ""seemed like a normal person"". Turns out this creep somehow found out where my workplace is and wanted to ""surprise me"" after work. But he was heartbroken and humiliated after seeing me walking out with some 6'2 Chad (yeah, he used this word) laughing and getting in the car.

He then continued his inadequate word diarrhoea about how women hate short men and date anyone who's over 6 feet tall despite them being ugly and broke, while my younger brother (yes, the very 6'2 Chad I hang out with daily because we work together) and I were dying from laughter.

Anyway, simply blocked this pathetic clown because I'm tired of being a free psychologist to all the men who were bullied in high school. It's the 5th time when I give a guy like this a chance and later get shamed for something related to height. Yeah, mate, sorry that my mum chose a 6'3 C h a d to have kids with while yours settled for someone under 5'10 and now you have to ""suffer"" in our cruel world designed exclusively for tall people.

By the way, now thinking about it, a first red flag was within 10 minutes after we met when I called an art dealer about buying a certain piece for my home office and this guy let his art connoisseur mask slip a little and he made some remarks about how it's a waste of money and I can get something way cheaper since it doesn't matter because nobody cares what I hang at home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q2jq5b/im_done_with_men_shorter_than_me/,1633524440.0,1492,0.76,176,FemaleDatingStrategy,aoi4eg
q2jaks,More on Why Block and Delete Works,"Spin-off to an earlier post someone did, as I‚Äôve been thinking. Most communication with men is not done in good faith especially with LVM or LV people who are the main people you would be looking to block.

If you‚Äôre already at the point you need to block them there‚Äôs been disrespect- usually repeated or long term.

Disrespect they themselves would not take if the situation was reversed. If you‚Äôre having to get rid of them over repeated disrespect it‚Äôs a fallacy when people say you must cOmMuNiCaTe why with them. 

They‚Äôre assuming this time, when emotions are running high and they are already butt hurt from rejection, is going to be the one time out of 100 opportunities they‚Äôve already had when they finally behave and treat what you‚Äôre saying with respect. 

How likely is that. You‚Äôre leaving them because of disrespect but that one last emotionally difficult convo is going to be the one time they act right and respect you even though there were 99 instances of disrespect prior?

In my experience, men only use communicating why you‚Äôre leaving to invalidate and make you seem wrong or unreasonable, despite knowing exactly what they did. To play dense. To gaslight. And oftentimes to make you out to be crazy.

I‚Äôve even had men demand an explanation from me only to make me out to be crazy and overinvested when I give one. Like I‚Äôm doing too much or need psychological help, which is of course a distraction from the faults and failures I raised about them to neg me in return with a psychological concern troll that I need professional help if I‚Äôm *that upset* or *that worked up*. Even though I‚Äôd given them no explanation at the outset and they had to drag it out of me.

They sought to elicit a reaction, even straight up demanded one, to then shame and humiliate me on it

Almost all end demands by men to communicate when you‚Äôve hit critical mass are false ones. They don‚Äôt really mean it genuinely.

Same often goes for friendships and jobs where you feel you have to ghost.

Demands to communicate at that point are almost never done in good faith, are almost always just entrees to manipulation and invalidation so that they can save face in their failure by putting you down or blaming you

They want an emotional response so they can call you nuts. A rational one so they can tell other people you were overbearing or uptight and unreasonable - any ammo they can use to put blame back on you in the court of public opinion so they don‚Äôt seem like the problem 

They‚Äôre basically whining and pleading and demanding- *Let me abuse/ humiliate you one final time- so I can leave with a clear conscience that I shit on you last/ put you in your place*. It‚Äôs a power play and a plea for one final act of dominance over you.

Deny them this opportunity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q2jaks/more_on_why_block_and_delete_works/,1633522893.0,369,0.96,34,FemaleDatingStrategy,InspectorGadget07
q2hisj,"A very subtle sign of a manipulative, gaslighting LVBF.","This is something I only realised very clearly when I already broke up with my ex boyfriend. When a guy you‚Äôre dating or in relationship with seems overly interested in hearing about your stories/accomplishments when you‚Äôre in a group (talking to family and friends), but when talking about yourself when you‚Äôre alone with him‚Ä¶ he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to hear about it. That‚Äôs a HUGE üö©. 

I once had a LVX who did this. We lived together, and when I was talking about my day at work or my favourite hobbies, he was always less than interested and even talked down on it. Sometimes, he would even pretend to fall asleep (!!) as a ‚ÄòjOkE‚Äô while I was explaining something specific about my hobby. ü§°
 But when we where on a gathering with family or friends and someone else would ask me about these aspects of my life, he faked a sincere interest when I was talking to a group of people about my new job or my progress in my hobbies. He even praised me for my accomplishments. 

It was horrible, because he put up a fake facade as an engaged, interested boyfriend to my friends and family, so they would never suspect he would be so disrespectful and uninterested behind closed doors. It‚Äôs manipulative behaviour and I would even say it‚Äôs a form of gaslighting.

q1rmt8,Trust your intuition,"Manipulators may use all the right words to mess with your mind. However, your body is very perceptive to sense manipulation if you listen to it.

This is a reminder for you to check in on yourself how the presence of people makes you feel (this is important for dating but also applicable for other social situations). If you have a hard time listening to your intuition, check your body for stress symptoms. Do you have tensions in your muscles? In your core, your jaw or your shoulders? Are you shrinking yourself? Do you feel anxious about your behavior / speech / body language around someone? If yes, your body is sending you signals of stress and discomfort that you keep ignoring.

It's all starting to make sense where I learned my pickme habits from, and why I accept the behaviour I do from the men in my life. Last night my dad was going to take me out for dinner, to make up for forgetting my birthday previous to this one (who forgets their daughter's 30th birthday?!). For the past year I've been trying to make plans to see him, he bails at the last minute, or can't commit to a plan.

We had dinner plans at 6pm and I know he's always late. We spoke at 3pm, I told him I'd meet with him for 6pm. I showered, got dressed up and did my makeup. I was very excited. 7pm rolls around and I finally phone him, and he says he's busy with his hobby, and he'll be another hour. I hung up.

I blocked and deleted him today. My time is SO valuable to me - it has to be. I own multiple companies and my schedule is very carefully penciled in. What an absolute waste of my time.

I understand a lot more about myself now because of this, and hopefully by taking this large step I can really begin to heal and grow.

p8w9su,You should NEVER give ugly men a chance,"A lot of women trick themselves into forming relationships with ugly short men who they don't find attractive with the hopes that he would stay loyal to her and treat her well. I constantly hear pickme women and ugly men say that uglier men tend to be nicer but this is FAR from the truth! The reality is, **unattractive men are some of the most bitter misogynistic hateful self loathing and entitled pricks you will ever meet.** If you ever date these men, they WILL ruin you. Why? Because these men are highly insecure and KNOW that you're better than them and have more options. Therefore, they can't stoop to your level (in terms of looks) so what do they do? **They bring you down to their level. They will neg you, put down your looks, and gaslight you into thinking YOU'RE the ugly one. They'll even shame you for liking attractive men and call you shallow and a hypergamous wh\*re for liking men at your level.** Give an ugly man a chance and watch his ego sky rocket and he will act like he's better than you üòÇ These are the same group of men who are obsessed with RedPill and PUA because you have to ask yourself, if he's so good looking and tall, why would he need strategies to manipulate women into sex? Just lol. These are bottom barrel men trying to prevent natural selection from weeding them out of the gene pool.

I'm serious. Ugly men are severely damaged and they're the ones who perpetuate the myth that ""women don't like nice guys"" (referring to themselves) and that ""ugly men treat women better! all Chad's are cheaters!"". They do this because they want to fear monger and make you settle for them because they know women want loyalty and commitment. The reason why an ugly man will stay loyal to you is because he has no other options but **at least a good looking man from a stable family is with you because he genuinely likes you and not because he lacks other prospects. Ugly men will also shame you into settling for them and lowering your standards. They'll make fun of you for being a single woman(calling you a lonely cat lady etc) so that you can settle for them. I'd rather be virgin nun than to ever date an ugly man ü§Æü§Æü§Æ**

Trust me. Ive had men at my workplace who are super short and repulsive to look at tell me that the boy I had a crush on in high school (he's good looking and tall) is a cheater. They didn't even know the guy, they only saw his pics and that automatically made them come up with all these assumptions out of jealousy. Ugly LVM men know that good looking men from a stable family are actually more HVM than they are but they RELY on fear mongering other women into dating them and are very quick to antagonize attractive men. The guy i had a crush on literally had a girlfriend from high school and they're still dating in college.

Truth is, men who are raised well and are decently attractive don't really have much of a reason to be assholes. They get treated well by society, their families, and have a healthier outlook in life. **Ugly men tend to be broken and damaged and will externalize all their anger, pain, insecurities and frustrations onto women. Some women will feel pity for them and think giving these men some love will heal them ü§°ü§°ü§° These men will also try to prevent you from levelling up and improving your life because they'd feel like they're losing control of you if you do so.**

Sure this is just a generalization but **from what I've noticed, some of the best men are usually good looking men from a two-parent stable households and have sisters.** That's just my observation. Obviously, there are attractive men who are fuckboys (Tinder Chads) but I've noticed they tend to come from unstable backgrounds and don't have proper families. Also, lots of baggage from some past trauma or are Cluster B men (Narcs, Sociopaths/Psychos) who are overly spoiled and an only child.

Here's the thing: If you know that most men are just not worth shit, then why would you waste your valuable time and energy on men you're not attracted to? I'd rather date the hot asshole than the ugly one who's also an asshole.

If you're someone who wants kids, it's even more selfish to date ugly men because daughters are more likely to look like their father's and if she inherits his unattractive genes, she will be the target of bullying.  **If you feel like you're not good looking enough to date a handsome man, then you can always level up and try to be the best version of yourself possible and some man you're mutually attracted to will think you're gorgeous.** He doesn't have to be a 10/10 model. Just someone you're attracted to who's at your level looks wise.

I'm just honestly so sick of women forcing themselves to date men they find ugly with the hopes that he will be loyal and kind ü§°ü§°ü§° **I honestly wish women would be more look-ist and take physical attraction into consideration when vetting for men.  I'm so sick of women being guilt-tripped for liking Chads while you got men who look like 1/10 neanderthal balding hairline midgets with tiny d\*cks who demand a model** üíÄ This mindset needs to be changed ASAP.

**Repeat after me: Being single is way better than dating an ugly man who you're not attracted to.**  **~~I can already tell this will trigger the pickmes and crybaby shrimp dicks~~**

p8w6p9,I broke up with my boyfriend because he uses p0rn,"He and I started dating in June and made it official in July. We planned a trip together to celebrate, and it was lovely. On our last day he asked me to use his phone to navigate so he could focus on the road. I needed to look up the address on Google, and when I opened a new tab I noticed P0rnHub was his most frequently visited website, and his search history reflected the same. I brought it up to him the next day as we set off for home and he shrugged it off as if it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I told him it was a dealbreaker for me. At this point I knew things were over between us bc I don‚Äôt have the energy to stress about a p0rn addict in my life, but out of curiosity I asked if he would give it up. He said no. Flat out. He said it was a stupid dealbreaker to have, and that I was being immature. He also said he would be willing to help me get past the feelings of discomfort if I choose not to uphold this particular boundary. I broke up with him and we spent the rest of our flight sitting in separate seats.

p8nwcw,Is he a HVM or is he just less abusive?,"One of the biggest difficulties of women being raised and groomed by LVM and NVM is unlearning behavioral patterns that we perceive as normal even though they are abusive. After being brought up by narcissists, enablers, Pickmeishas and NVM, the same mechanisms that helped us survive are now the same mechanisms that keep us trapped in relationships and situationships not beneficial to us. As we unwrap these patterns, any man who is slightly less bad or better at disguising his abusive side might feel like a breath of fresh air in the first moment.

A woman coming out of relationships shaped by psychological, sexual and physical abuse is easy prey for LVM who expect to be praised and coddled for performing the bare minimum. These are men who ""help"" with housework after their partner has asked them nicely (not nagging!) for 5 times and given them concrete instruction how to do this. These are the men who ""babysit"" their children once every two weeks so that their wife can have some me-time to take a shower and do the laundry. These are the men who would never rape a woman but who get passive-aggressive when their partner turns them down for sex. These are the men who insult their partner during a fight but apologize afterwards bc saying hurtful things to her made them feel bad. These are the men who need ""clear communication"" to learn that women do not enjoy having their partner insult their body. These are the men who watch porn secretly. These are the men who support feminism as long as it doesn't go too far. These are the men who are terrified to have daughters bc of all the bad guys out there but will laugh at their buddies' rape jokes. These are also men we need to stay away from.

In my last relationship (that started right after breaking up with a grandiose narcissist), I overlooked many red flags because he was not as bad as my other relationships. He seemed to act like a gentleman most of the time. But sometimes he would make a hurtful comment about my body, acting surprised when I did not appreciate his ""humour"" . Sometimes, he would try to coerce me into sex when I didn't want to but if I turned him away energetically rather then hesitantly he would actually stop. He would actually communicate about problems we had and let me explain basic feelings to him as if this could make up for his lack of empathy. Back then, this relationship felt like the best thing that I ever had. It took me a long time to understand that he too was manipulative and abusive towards me, long after the relationship had ended.

For women coming out of abusive relationships or family structures, telling subtle abusive behavior apart from daily miscommunication is extremely difficult, especially if a man frequently displays seemingly HVM behavior. This is why keeping away from dating after an abusive relationship is so crucial. This is why selfcare is crucial. This is why filling our lives with fulfilling activities and friendships with supportive women is crucial. If you start dating a man, you should not compare him to other men in your life. You want to find a man that is amazing and good for you - not just one who is less shitty than your exes. Does he add value to your life? Does he consistently treat you with love and respect? If a conflict arises, put yourself in his shoes. Do you really understand his perspective? Was it really a misunderstanding? Did he really think that making a comment about your belly fat was funny? Did he really insult your cooking because he thought this was constructive criticism? Was it really impossible for him to see that you did not want to have sex with him when you turned away half asleep? Did he offer you an actual apology or did he brush it off, claiming you shouldn't be so sensitive? Would you act in a similar way if the roles were reversed? Would you let this comment or this behavior slide if it was your friend? Would you treat yourself like this?

Stay woke and stay strong ladies. Treat yourself like a queen and don't accept any less of a potential partner. The vetting process never ends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/p8nwcw/is_he_a_hvm_or_is_he_just_less_abusive/,1629534734.0,333,0.97,13,FemaleDatingStrategy,edelbiatch

p8kohe,Men have no ability to emotionally regulate because society has been coddling their feelings from the moment they were born,"The amount of posts I see on this site where a man askes something along the lines of:

""I can't get over that my girlfriend had sex with other men.""

""My girlfriend told me I don't make her cum and now I feel bad.""

This complaining does nothing to fix their bad behavior. In addition, every single time its something like:

""Please show me how to get over it.""

These men have literally lived their lives and NEVER have had to learn how to manage difficult emotion. This entitlement and inability to stfu is endemic. Women feel these things too (to a lesser extent due to socialization telling us that we don't deserve good things, etc) but we don't make it other people's problem. Men blame. Women internalize. We move past our feeling and get on with what needs to be done despite our mental health. FDS has been mind opening.

p8ispv,Lurking Redpill forums is actually very beneficial for women,"I know its depressing and revolting and reminds you of what utter trash most men are, but you can take this to your advantage. It's literally FREE information! They're writing out all their strategies and tricks that they use to 'plate' woman and the best part is, by learning their strategies and POV, you can counteract it. You can also use it to learn how to decode their language.

They constantly update and adapt their strategies as well so you need to keep up. Common tactics they use are:

* lying about their trauma and opening up too quickly about their mental health and emotions. Heck, they might even try to trauma bond with you. ""Hey OP, i'm also an FA man with depression :( im gonna take the exit bag soon T\_T lets chat yadayada"" and this can manifest irl too
* lying about their moms having cancer to form a quicker bond with women
* the hot and cold strategy: they'll act super simpy and text you ALOT and act all interested in pursuing you then weeks later, they will ghost. This is basically turning the tables and now forces you into a position where you try to message them and do the chasing
* after having sex with you, they will ghost you, and return back a few days/week later with a bunch of apologies and excuses. Its really just a shit test to test your boundaries and see if you will take them back. Also, to make it look like they're in high demand. Luckily FDS women are immune to this trick, but its a common one
* hyping up their ex girlfriends which puts you into a position of competition where you try to prove that you can be better than their ex; or even the reverse where they shit on their ex alot and act like hurt ""pick me boys"" who got played by his ex and now ur walking on eggshells trying to pander to this scrote and prove ur not like his ex who ""broke him""
* they'll approach a group of women and give attention to the woman they find ugliest so that the more attractive friends can try to get their attention and will have their egos bruised.

&amp;#x200B;

There's just SO MANY more tricks they use. Its literally goldmine. Best part is a lot of these tricks can be used the other way around too. For example, you can also hype up your ex boyfriend and subtly brag about what an amazing man he was.

I can't list them all of the RP strategies in the top of my head but i can recognize them because I've looked through their forums enough times. Feel free to comment some other strategies they've used.

p8ieun,Starting to Regret Getting Tattooed,"The amount of times I have been approached and sexually harassed by scrotes using my tattoos as an excuse is ridiculous. This week especially has been the worst. In the first incident, I was waiting at the bus stop after having spent 3 hours at the beach. Needless to say, I was dead tired and just wanted to go home. Yet some scrote thought it was the perfect opportunity to swoop in to ask me about my tattoos. He extended his hand for a handshake to which I refused (hello, delta variant?!). Then he started sulking like a f-cking baby that I am being weird and ‚Äúnot friendly‚Äù. What?! Yesterday on my way to work, I was accosted by this loser in the subway who literally checked out my tattoos right there and then proceeded to talk me into becoming one of his bottle girls. I know this isn‚Äôt really relevant but I was literally wearing a $100 work dress, a $400 designer handbag, and a $200 pair of shoes. My outfit alone probably costs more than his rent, yet when he said that at that moment, I couldn‚Äôt help feeling so cheap and insulted. Here I was, a grown ass white-collar professional woman being treated like a naive high school girl dying for male attention. I could barely contain my disgust and tried my best to contain my anger and contempt as there weren‚Äôt many others on the subway train. When my stop arrived, I bolted right out. Several hours later as I was walking home from work, some 5-foot dwarf loser with sagging jeans started walking right next to me, talking something about my tattoos and pointing at them. Exhausted, I straight up said that I‚Äôm not interested and that I have a bf. The scrote literally replied back ‚Äúso? I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù He sounded so much like a predatory rapist ü§Æ All kinds of alarm bells started ringing in my head and I pretended I forgot something and dashed away while dialing my bf. I‚Äôm so sick of these f-cking losers thinking they‚Äôre entitled to comment on my appearance and waste my valuable time and energy. I got my tattoos because I‚Äôve always loved the aesthetic and have a great appreciation for the art form, but lately, all the sexual harassment I‚Äôve been getting is making me lowkey regret having so many. The fact that I had a male ex-friend say it makes me look like a ‚Äúhot pornstar‚Äù makes me feel even worse ü§Æ I would love to even wear a spaghetti strap tank top or dress in this scorching heat without some scrote thinking I‚Äôm wearing it for him. I would love to walk outside and run errands in comfortable casual clothing with my tattoos showing without being harassed. I would love for men to stop typecasting me as easy and sexually available just because I have lots of tattoos.

p8dy8l,Exercise: Learn to take yourself out on a date,"This self-love exercise is particularly meant for those who try to recover from love-bombing after leaving an long-term abusive relationship, especially when you are struggling with social anxiety. However, it can - and IMHO should - be an integral component of a healthy relationship with yourself. No matter if you are single or in a committed relationship you should always be happy with yourself first and foremost. Nobody can or should relive you from this ""burden"". 

Men, even LVM as long as they have their shit  together (at least slightly), do this this all the time. They don't call it a ""date with themselves"" tho. The reason I chose this term is because women face different socialization that men. When we go out alone it is implied that our only reason to do so is to meet a man. A date should focus on the person you are engaging with. In this particular case that's you. By labeling it as a date I want to highlight that this exercise focuses quality time.

**Step 1, Know your boundaries:** Decide beforehand if you would be open to engage with a man if one were to approach you while you are out alone. Are you willing to interrupt your public you-time when a supposed HVM chats you up? If so, under what conditions? Personally won't do it, at least not the first few times, as it defeats the purpose of the whole practice. But ofc that's up to you. If you are at a cafe/bar you could compromise by giving him your number (if he asks) but don't allow him to sit at your table/invite you on a drink. FDS is against coffee/drink dates for a reason and a HVM wouldn't impose himself on you like that.

**Step 2, Find your place:** What do you want to do? Think of some place you always wanted to visit with your ex yet he never took you there. Now is the time. The high rope course next to your city, a small but romantic trip in a rowboat at the local pond, visiting the new hookah bar in town, a 4 courses pick-nick after a small hike, that cutesy, little coffee shop you always walk past after work, etc. 

You know yourself the best. Find the location that screams ""hell yeah"" to you.  
**Step 3, Planning and backup:** I recommend to visit about 2-3 different locations on your date. It ensures that if one location doesn't turn out as great as expected (like a rude waiter, weather turning bad, restaurant is closed unexpectedly) your time doesn't feel wasn't. Especially if you put in effort to get dolled up. By having a row of different locations you minimize the risk of sudden disappointment due to uncontrollable external circumstances. At worst you shrug it off and move on to the next event, at best you have an extraordinarily great time.   
*Note: When a HVM plans a date he always has a some kind of a backup plan too, in case things don't work out as they should. Btw FDS warns about the pickup manipulation tactic of visiting several different locations during the first dates to trick your brain into a false sense of intimacy. I'm aware of this and I also advice against it when vetting a new romantic interest. But his here is a different scenario. This is not a first date. You are in an established relationship with yourself. You already know and trust yourself. You won't get handsy with yourself against your will. If anything, you build more genuine intimacy with yourself and this is always a good thing.*

Examples for different date locations are:

Cocktails(1h) -&gt; Cinema(2h)

Coffee/Tea (1,5h) -&gt; Shopping(2-3h) -&gt; Ice Cream in restaurant(1/2h)

Lunch at restaurant (1h) -&gt; Hookah bar(2-3h) -&gt; meeting friends for the rest of the evening

Brunch(1h) -&gt; Outdoor activity with a small prepared pick-nick/lunch (5h) -&gt; fade-out at coffee bar

Brunch(1h) -&gt; Day at the spa -&gt; buying yourself some little gift like a flower bouquet

&amp;#x200B;

My personal experience is that *build-up-phase* \-&gt; *main-event-phase* \-&gt; *fade-out-phase* works best. But it also depends on your chosen activity. Especially when you go for prolonged or physically challenging activities you won't want them to be the first item on your list.

*Safety: Your phone has to be fully charged before you leave. Pack a power bank. Depending on what you do make sure to inform your friends/relatives beforehand of your plans and location. If you go hiking alone keep a location tracker with you. Be equipped to defend yourself in case of emergency. Don't drive when you drink, opt for an uber/taxi instead. Be responsible. Treat your safety like a HVM would treat it. For a better understanding - watch out for yourself like you would for your bff/child/pet/another beloved being when you want them to get home safe late at night.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4, Pick a time**: Maybe you are a spontaneous person or maybe you prefer to plan days or weeks beforehand. Whatever the case may be you should make time for it. Schedule an appointment in your planner the same way you would do for a regular date with a man. Make sure work won't come in the way. Take care of work related issues beforehand. If you are a student your assignments should be finished or in a state where your mind doesn't wander off during the date. Inform your boss that you won't be reachable. If you have pets and/or children that require your attention find a pet-sitter/babysitter or ask your friends and family. Your handy is reserved for emergency cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 5, Enjoy your date:** Finally. This might sound easy but it can be a bit tricky when you are not used to it. Focus on your surroundings. Enjoy nature if you are outside. Use all your senses to stay in the moment. Recognize your company over and over again. **You are out on a date with the most important person you'll ever meet in your life so make sure you honor every moment with her.** If you are worried about of coming off as strange when sitting alone at the cafe you can indulge in reading that book you never had time for. Stay as long as you want and leave when you feel like doing something different. The most important thing is that you have fun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/p8dy8l/exercise_learn_to_take_yourself_out_on_a_date/,1629493448.0,240,0.97,21,FemaleDatingStrategy,_RustInPiece_

p8belk,One red flag is always enough...,"Over the past couple of years I became somewhat friendly with the father of my daughter's classmate.
By friendly, I mean having a chat when we see each other at school things, the kids hang out, occasional fb comments, erc.
He's divorced, extremely attractive and looks after himself.
He works hard, earns well, and is very involved in his daughters' lives.
He also seemed v intelligent and I always enjoyed talking to him. He's never said a bad word against his ex  
In fact, he's never said a single thing that raised any flags. 
If anything, he seemed compassionate and empathetic, and truly appeared to adore his daughters.
I've been to his apartment when dropping my daughter off and it's always spotless.

But one thing always bothered me - a mutual male friend once mentioned to me that it was his wife who initiated the divorce. She seems nice enough - attractive, intelligent, and well-groomed. 
If he really was such an amazing guy, why did she leave him after 12 years of marriage?

The other day I was talking to another friend who is very close with his ex-wife. She's not a gossip at all, but I asked her straight out why they got divorced.
She told me that he verbally and emotionally terrorized this poor woman.
She herself witnessed him absolutely raging at the ex-wife over a dirty dish in the sink or no milk in the fridge.
He'd constantly call her, checking where she was, who she was with, or to make sure she wasn't, heaven forbid, napping. Apparently he hated it and called her lazy because sometimes she'd take a nap.
Whenever he was scheduled to arrive home, no matter where she was or what she was doing, she'd get home 30 mins before his arrival to make sure everything was spotless, or he'd lose it.

I admit i was shocked, but i really shouldn't have been.

p84xrm,Why his music taste is extremely important during the vetting process.,"The type of music a man chooses to listen to is very telling of his character and his values. I don't want to paint everyone with the same brush, but from personal experiences this seems to be the case.

A man who listens to very aggressive music, whether rap or otherwise that consistently preaches objectiying women is a man who most likely believes in the message. I've never met a man who listens to music preaching ""fucking hoes, having threesomes, and getting bread"" as high value. In fact, these men were so entranced by this music and pop culture that they **built their entire identity around it**. Although these men weren't working jobs (half the time they were unemployed) that indicated they were ""getting bread"", they still tried to keep up with the Joneses by going into serious debt, and kept a harem of women.

This post was inspired by someone who thought it was brilliant to play me the song ""Like That"" by Yo Gotti. This song has literary genius verses such as ""But I only bought you Chanel cause I wanted you. You let me fuck you with your friend so I don't cheat on you."" Surprise! This person was a NVM fuckboy who had no healthy relationships at the ripe ol' age of 36.

Continuing to listen to music with such a toxic message began their descent from treating women respectfully and seeing them as human.

On the contrary, a man who listens to music with a positive message or is thought provoking views usually had a healthier take on relationships. 

As a great vetting question, you should ask a man what kind of music he listens to and who his favourite artist is. This question will give you more insight on what kind of things he nutures his brain with. Is it nonsense drivel with the overall goal of objectifying women? Or does he listen to music that is thought provoking and has artistic value?

As you can tell by my username, I'm a huge fan of electronic music. Not big room EDM stuff, but more underground progressive stuff. Now unfortunately, a lot of people who listen to this kind of music have a penchant for drugs so my dating pool is narrowed based on this common interest in music.

o3ouhp,"I'm appalled by some of the comments on Jammies' latest post. If you want to participate here, you have to respect our community. If being expected to follow subreddit rules makes you ""feel unwelcome"", then leave.","I was appalled by some of the comments on Jammies' recent post. So many people getting upset that a dating subreddit wants to stay on-topic as a dating subreddit.

FDS are not female separatists. If *you personally* don't want to date men for whatever reason, that is perfectly fine, you can still participate here so long as you respect the rules (particularly, ""no derailing"")

Ever since all the other female-focused subreddits got banned, I've noticed an influx of refugees from GC, BPF, PPF, femcels, etc. and quite frankly I do not like the direction that these users are trying to take us.

I would like to remind everyone that when these subreddits were around, some of them actually hated FDS.

I'm tagged as a ""gender critical user"" and some scrote is going around saying I used to be a mod of GC (which is completely false, I was never a mod of any of these other subreddits). In fact a lot of GC users (not all, but a lot) were hostile to FDS and called us ""male pandering"", ""upholding traditional gender roles"" (men paying for dates) and ""a subreddit for straight women addicted to dick""

At the time I was in a relationship with an emotionally abusive narcissist and anytime I mentioned my relationship when commenting in GC I basically got roasted for being stupid enough to date men at all. These types of comments were completely unhelpful in helping me break up with him. FDS was far more welcoming and compassionate.

Likewise, a lot of ""femcels"" and pinkpill feminism users criticized FDS for not doing enough to critique beauty standards and lookism, and blackpill feminism didn't like us because they don't think there is such a thing as ""high value men""

So I really don't appreciate that these same users who used to have so much contempt for FDS are now trying to take over FDS now that your communities got banned (...and then getting mad at our mods and downvoting us the moment we set boundaries for what our sub is about).

I get it, it's frustrating that this is the only female-only space on Reddit, but 1) it's not our fault your subs got banned and it's not our responsibility to pick up the slack, 2) we don't want our subreddit to transform into the very thing that got you banned in the first place, 3) there's a reason why FDS has grown so rapidly while yours have remained politically marginalized, so we want to stay consistent with our values and not get derailed.

Some of this may come as a surprise to ordinary users, but that's mostly a perspective issue. As mods, we remove or don't approve a lot of these types of content,  so we still see these, even if ordinary users don't. We are tired of having to constantly remove this shit and in the past couple days we started straight up banning these troublemaking users, which has made our jobs as mods a whole lot easier.

TL;DR: If you want to participate here you have to respect our community. You don't *have* to be actively dating to participate here but if you attempt to derail conversations with femcel/BPF/PPF/GC rhetoric you will be banned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o3ouhp/im_appalled_by_some_of_the_comments_on_jammies/,1624133707.0,838,0.89,113,FemaleDatingStrategy,myousername

o3n08o,Seemingly HV until you find out how he wants to raise your children,"I am well aware of the childfree movement and honestly, I am still deciding my future. If you are considering children with a HV man or are curious, this is for you.

He's the 'HV' man of dreams right? Incredible starting salary and high growth potential (that is practically guaranteed), understands the importance of taking care of his family, has a great network/support system that you might not have, your family loves him, he wants kids and you want kids, what a wonderful HV man right? **Ask him how he was raised and how he wants to raise his kids.**

I've been to more weddings than I can count (if I had to guess, over 60) and it is getting to a point that I can tell from their wedding website or engagement party what their future will look like. In almost all of these couples, NO ONE asks how he wants to raise their kids. And if they do, they say he was 'raised well' and wants the best for his kids. That is the bare minimum. Ask him what he specifically means. Questions like: Who will watch the kids when we are working or gone? Were you spanked as a kid? Do you believe in spanking? Were there any restrictions you had as a child (curfews, television/film ratings, if your friends could come over, etc)? How were child/child or child/parent conflicts handled in your house? Did your parents encourage you and your siblings to hit each other or to talk it out as children? Were you taught how to do car maintenance, how to cook, how to garden, how to navigate a city by yourself, what the value of money is? 

If any of these questions feel uncomfortable to ask, please understand that finding out **AFTER** you have children together is worse. And of course, the man could say all the perfect answers... so ask his parents and/or childhood friends about him in childhood. Look at the 'HV' man's actions and see how he reacts to children.

Out of all of the weddings, two I remember clearly because of the way they are now. The men classically checked off all the boxes, the women and family thought he is great, beautiful wedding and wonderful honeymoon, nice first year or two, then boom. 

First couple, the man wanted to raise the kids and by that he wanted to outsource parenting to babysitters/nannies/and friends. He did not want to teach his kids how to do anything in or out of the household and said that the kids would learn from other people as they got older. He wanted his kids as a badge of honor and to claim all their accomplishments as his own (narc). His wife is not allowed (by him) to teach their kids to do any of this either because 'he said so.' He's not the breadwinner but has his whole family under his control because he's 'the man.'

Second couple, same thing. Great on paper man, short engagement, enviable wedding. Even before they had kids (they waited a while), they had DV issues. She didn't want to ruin his career, so she kept quiet. They have kids and he is teaching them the same way he was raised. He is almost never home, he never says where he is going to be, but has the wife make sure the kids go to the best schools, have the best childcare, and when he is around he neglects his children and tells them to hit each other to resolve conflicts. But he will always tell strangers that his favorite place to be is at home with his children and wife. Cue the 'awwwws.'

The women in both of these examples got the 'I want the best for my kid' response when they were dating the men. They never asked more questions and just assumed that if he wanted the best for himself, that automatically meant he would put in all his effort into wanting the best for his family. WRONG. In both cases the men wanted the children to be 'mini-me' versions of themselves with minimal effort put in on his side.

Someone saying that their husband 'picks up his kids,' 'gives them hugs,' or 'kisses them goodnight,' is listing the bare minimum. Is he a hands-on dad that shows his children how to do things like how to cook or change a tire? Does he encourage them at their sports lessons or in school? Does he take the time to make sure the children feel safe and welcome in their own home? Does he work a lot or far away but makes sure his family is doing well every free second he gets? Or is he a dad that cannot be left at home more than 4 hours with the kids because he gets frustrated? Is he a dad that misses every milestone for the kid because he has work and refuses to take off? Is he a dad that yells at the kid for acting out but does nothing to prevent it? Is he a dad that takes all the accomplishments for himself to brag to his friends?

I would like to add that in the couples I've seen, I have noticed a tiny percentage of women who pull this same bait-and-switch but it is **overwhelmingly** the men that do it. 

I cannot stress enough to know your partner well and should you have children, know how they want to raise them. Do not carry the pick-me mindset of 'he'll change.' HE WON'T CHANGE. Years down the line, you will have children who will repeat the cycle.

As we always say here, constantly vet.

""Actually, most men I've met treated me/women badly"" ""If every man you've dated was a jerk, there is probably something wrong with you, you're the common denominator""","I see this type of exchange echoed all over Reddit and even IRL discussions on dating.

It's just yet another way of blaming women for male depravity. 

If a woman has one bad dating experience and becomes more guarded around men, she is ""doing the same thing as incels and letting one bad experience affect her perception of all men""

If a woman has had multiple bad experiences with men and becomes more guarded, she is ridiculed for ""choosing the wrong guys"" and is blamed because ""she's the common denominator""

In either case, the woman is blamed for men treating her badly, and the implication is that men as a class are innocent and generally good, and that each man deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt, no matter what.

Meanwhile, men already know deep down that most men are trash. Just see how they behave when they have a daughter. Or how a man reacts if his girlfriend/wife has a male friend or coworker she spends a lot of time with. All men already know that men are not to be trusted. 

It's time women stop buying their propaganda and treat men with the same suspicion that men already treat other men.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o34fe9/you_cant_let_one_bad_experience_color_your/,1624063356.0,1093,0.94,96,FemaleDatingStrategy,myousername

It's no wonder all the men in my life up until this point have been ass clowns. I'm not vetting people and valuing my own worth.  At first, I was voraciously consuming content from the handbook and scrolling through comments but today, I feel heaviness. It feels like I'm grieving my past mistakes, all the wasted time, and the fact that I have been dating from a desperate, lonely place. I strive to get to place where I can conduct myself like the Queen that I am, but it'll take so much work. I'm overwhelmed by the undertaking, and feeling heavy from the guilt of not realizing this sooner.

The whole point of the show is about how to be a good person. 

And the conclusion is that you do it by just working at it every day. As best you can. In small ways and big ones. 

And I decided that I want my partner to be someone who, like me, tries to be a little bit better every day. I want him to care deeply about making the world better in the ways he can. 

I have been separated from LVX for about a month now. It‚Äôs the first time I have been able to express what I mean by being kind. 

My LVX just wasn‚Äôt kind. At all. To anyone, including himself. I feel bad for him but it is not my problem.

o2ruw6,He is not Prince Charming,"That guy you are dating, he isn't Prince Charming, he's a man. A human being. He is not your perfect Prince Charming in spite of one major flaw, or several, that you just have to overlook. I see this sentiment a lot among women, on this subreddit, and even in the way I used to be.

However wonderful he is he is human. Relationships can be difficult. Living together is difficult. Sometimes you get tired of people, you don't want to have sex with them, you get annoyed by the little things they do. That means he needs to be fantastic to make it work.

Just like job searching or buying a house, or literally any other thing in life, you should be making a list that is everything you could ever possibly want and *checking him against that list*. You should not be making your list based on the minimum you're willing to accept. I see a lot of women who act like he is some kind of Prince Charming *except for* this or that. This is only going to get you someone that meets your bare minimum and will probably fall even lower.

Think about that saying to *shoot for the moon and you'll fall among the stars.* You should be asking for more than your bare minimum, a lot more! Just because your bare minimum is 5'8 doesn't mean you shouldn't be looking for someone who's 6 ft if that is what you really want. I don't want to be with someone who's 5'8. I'd prefer someone 6 ft tall, bare minimum is 5'10. If you want somebody who makes 100K then look for somebody who makes 100K rather than accepting 40K. If you want to be a stay-at-home mom stick to your standards and find somebody who will be able to support that. Stop selling yourself short and accepting things you don't want. Don't low-ball yourself. It just does the LVMs work for him. Patriarchal society wants you to lowball yourself, to settle. Don't.

*But what if he's the love of my life and all I have to do is accept that he's 5'8 and has bad teeth????""

*But what if he's the love of my life and the perfect match for me except for the fact that he's ugly and doesn't take care of his body???*

*What if he is the perfect man for me except for the fact that he has no drive and barely works???*

This is a symptom of low standards, low self-esteem, being taught you're not allowed to have things you want and scarcity mindset. Women are constantly taught that we have to accept what's put on our plate, not reject it or ask for more because that's selfish, presumptuous, petulant. We need to make our own plate. If we don't we will only ever get scraps. You are allowed to ask for what you really want and *get it*. 

He is not a fantasy. He is a real person. He's not Prince Charming. Don't live in a fantasy world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o2ruw6/he_is_not_prince_charming/,1624030466.0,329,0.9,12,FemaleDatingStrategy,radical__daphne
o2riho,‚Äú50 Shades of Grey‚Äù was horrible and it‚Äôs tragic that it led so many young women to BDSM,"At the time, I worked a job that was uneventful, but they let us read. I read the first 50 shades, suffered through the second, then refused to read the third. I chose boredom over suffering through another one of those shit ‚Äúnovels‚Äù. 

It was the worst written work I have ever read. I know it started out as Twilight fan fiction (which it reads like Twilight fan fiction) but how did it get through an editor? There were scenes that were so similar that I thought the author repeated a page from a previous chapter. ‚Äú50 Shades of Grey‚Äù makes ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù look like a Jane Austen novel.

I digress. It is commonly accepted that ‚Äú50 Shades of Grey‚Äù is what caused the BDSM boom. It grooms unsuspecting women into BDSM by misrepresenting what BDSM is. If you compare the novel with porn, there is a huge disconnect. So now, young women are associating torture with romance. Whereas, romance is lost in porn. These women are expecting Christian Grey, but I‚Äôve never met a tall/dark/handsome dom. Every self proclaimed ‚Äúdom‚Äù I have ever met, was a gross misogynistic loser. Who is taking out his years of rejection out on a much younger woman with false expectations. As for, bUt iTs aLl aBoUt cOnSeNt, if you had to pressure a woman into sex by threatening to leave or ‚Äúgetting it somewhere else‚Äù or mY nEeds, it‚Äôs not consent. It‚Äôs coercion.

Also, BDSM is not fringe. It is mainstream. You are not punk rock for abusing your girlfriend. You are actually over conforming.

o2r4qq,Objectification versus sexual attraction desire and arousal,"I've noticed a lot of women here have a big problem with feeling sexual attraction to men and liking it to sexual objectification. Liking a man's abs, strong arms or thinking his ass is amazing is not sexual objectification. That is sexual attraction. That's normal, safe, and okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. It doesn't make you like male rapists and abusers.

Sexual objectification is about seeing someone as an *object* for your sexual *use*. That means you don't care if they like you too. You don't care what they want. You don't care when they want to stop. You are a rapist and an abuser. You see the person as a thing and not a human being. You think you are entitled to do whatever you want to this person. This is very MALE. LVM. 

Women get turned off when the man doesn't want us. We get turned off when his personality is unattractive, or we find out he's kind of dumb, or a regressive sexist and racist. We aren't looking to overpower and rape him. We aren't looking to abuse him. We aren't looking to continue sex with him after he says no and stop. We don't conceive of him as an object with no inner life, rights and thoughts.

I suggest if you are uncomfortable with finding a man sexually attractive that you do some inner thought and exploration about where those thoughts came from. Why do you feel it's bad to be attracted to a man? Why are you uncomfortable with your sexuality or women's sexuality in general? 

This is sexist. 

A high value woman understands the importance of sexual attraction in a relationship and isn't looking to sell herself short by dating a man she's not sexually attracted to. She is not going to be trapped making herself have sex with him for years. Then wondering why the sex isn't satisfying and she doesn't orgasm. Don't kneecap your relationship by getting with someone you don't even find physically attractive. It is completely pointless and a waste of your time. High value women don't waste their time. Find someone who takes care of himself so you won't get disgusted with him later. Be a ruthless strategist in your sexual strategy as well as all the other facets of dating.

It actually disgusts me, I'm way grossed out by STDs. If a guy has been with more than one other person or a few/a lot of people, I can't bring myself to think of him sexually anymore or even consider giving him a chance romantically. A guy who was willing to hookup, at any point in his life (aka willing to participate in sexual intercourse un-enjoyable for the vast majority of women) is just a huge turn off. I don't know why they think it isnt, lol. But that's my standard, and I think I'm allowed to have it considering most guys don't even regularly get tested for STDs. Does anyone else feel this way?

o2a59q,Men do not form meaningful friendships with other men. It is not your job as a woman to fill in that void.,"Women and men do not form friendships in the same way. As women we are able to connect on a deeper level with each other and I really love that. We can confide in each other, open up emotionally, hug, give each other advice etc. I‚Äôm so tired of the myth that men have closer friendships because that is absolutely bullshit. Women have more empathy which means their friendships are healthier and real. 


You know how guys joke that they don‚Äôt even know their friends last name or any other basic personal details? They try to pass it off as some *heurgh heurgh we‚Äôre simple men we don‚Äôt need to know each other‚Äôs life stories, that‚Äôs gay* but it‚Äôs actually symptomatic of a deeper issue: men do not form real connections with each other. All of their friendships are shallow, macho and empty. They respect each other yes (men only respect men) but that‚Äôs about it. 

So what do they do? They try to find a woman to unload all of their emotional baggage. Men primarily seek women so they can have someone to bang and subsequently vent to. They will open up about their trauma, anxieties and problems. They will use you as a therapist all day long and this makes the woman believe that they have a meaningful relationship. This is far from the truth. If he‚Äôs doing all of the talking and seems disinterested once you open your mouth, it‚Äôs time to move on. 

A lot of us mistakenly believe that men appreciate a woman they can open up to. I‚Äôm here to tell you to **stop doing that shit unless you‚Äôre in a committed relationship with a HVM**. Do not give just any scrote your emotional labor, do not ‚Äòlend an ear‚Äô, do not let them vent to you. Act distant and make it clear that you‚Äôre not here to give him emotional support. Stop letting men use you emotionally just because they think that‚Äôs your job as a woman. 

A lot of male friends will also try this. They don‚Äôt tell their bros about their problems but they‚Äôll sure come running to you. If a guy friend ever tries that with you just tell him to ask his homies. And then see what he says. 

Men have created a society in which they are unable to open up to each other. It is entirely their fault that almost all men are emotionally constipated and unable to express their feelings without being labelled gay or whatever. We are NOT to blame for their issues. All our lives we were told that they‚Äôre the logical/less emotional gender and now they wanna cry about the male suicide and depression rate? Well you can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too. Either you‚Äôre a super rational being with no feelings (not like those silly women of course /s) or you‚Äôre just a normal human being who wants an emotional connection. 

Ladies, it‚Äôs time to stop coddling these men. Enjoy your friendships with women who actually care about you instead of wasting your time with some loser who views you as a sex toy/therapist hybrid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o2a59q/men_do_not_form_meaningful_friendships_with_other/,1623970143.0,620,0.85,70,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

o27rce,"The last podcast episode made me realise that all these ""extreme cheapskates"" dudes are probably just abusers doing coercive control","I was getting flashbacks the whole time listening to the guest talking about the signs of coercive control. Having rules &amp; regulations for every single thing in the house sounded exactly like my daughters father. 

We were never married and we only lived together 1 year and during that time I got pregnant.

He was nice at first but always very very cheap. It started out small but slowly got worse over time.

He didnt want to spend money on anything. Got mad at me when I spent money even if it was my own money.

He had all these rules &amp; regulations for every single thing around the house but pretended like the reason was to ""save money""

How to wash dishes, how to shower, how to do laundry, can never ever buy anything new, always try to fix broken things, cant spend money on cleaning or going to the doctor or looking good because its a ""waste of money""

Its like my happiness was a waste of money to him.

Whats weird is that he wasnt even poor, he had a good paying job, he said he was saving money for ""investments"" and future stuff.

Over time his reactions to when I didnt follow the rules got worse and worse. At first he would just shame me and make me feel bad and guilty. Then he would yell at me. Then he started putting his hands on me, shove me, grab me, and so on if I was doing something wrong. 

It gave me so much anxiety just to exist. Every time I had to do anything I was afraid of ""or else"". I was too terrified to even tell him I got pregnant because I thought he would make me get a back alley abortion because ""kids are a waste of money"" but also going to the doctor to get a real abortion is a ""waste of money""

I knew I had to leave him before he found out I was pregnant. I probably should have had an abortion but I didnt. I dont regret it as I love my daughter. I moved back in with my parents and then told him I was pregnant, he freaked out. Threatened me.

After I gave birth I petitioned for child support which made him even more crazy. He tried to get split custody to avoid paying child support but I showed the screenshots of him threatening to give me a miscarriage and the court gave me full custody, no visitation (didnt give me the restraining order I asked for tho)

""Condoms are a waste of money"" okay well fuck you, now you have to pay child support for 18 years, you fucking cheapskate asshole.

Nowadays I cant even watch ""extreme cheapskates"" on TV without having to turn it off, its way too triggering. 

This is why I love FDS. There is something seriously wrong with cheap men and I love that FDS doesnt try to make me feel bad for not wanting to date them.

As always thanks for another amazing episode. RIP Jennifer.

o26jfm,HOW TO TEXT LIKE A QUEEN üì±üëë,"So you found a man you consider to be a potential partner. Good. Now we gotta revise how the fuck we gotta text&amp;call him.

#Queen Mindset to adopt:

You're the LESS interested one, a Queen to be impressed, and the one that needs to be convinced of his quality as a partner. You're NOT the one woo'ing him, he is. Upon reading the rules, keep that mindset in mind. 

Several fundamental rules:
##1. You return the SAME energy as he sends you, but a little bit LESS than him. 

It means that if he is double texting, you don't double text but send one single text. If he's sending 3 sentences you send him 1-2 sentences. If he's sending one emoji, you don't send him a emoji, and only send him a emoji once he's going harder with emojis. If he is writing bare effort stuff to you, you return the same but a bit less. Same principle with calls, except you return the same energy via voice. 

Doing it a bit les than him sends off the message you're not hooked on him. 

 He gotta step it up, so that he wins your participation and online presence. You're not giving him enterainement for free with the precious thing that your attention is (that he craves A LOT). 

If he pulls away and get lower effort, you mirror this too. A Pickme would double up the effort in a desperate effort to keep him around, and this way, the dynamic gets switched around; the woman is the one catering to the man. Mental energy and time is wasted on something that's SUPPOSED to be effortless. 

##2. You cut the communication BEFORE him

The key is to convey that you're unattainable, and that you're the busiest one, and that he HAS to ask you out to have that exclusive time he has with you.

If it's getting long and annoying or that you got something else to do, you cut it short. You're not free-on-demand enterainement, he IS. If he cuts it before you, you gotta cut him off next time. Pretend you're busy, that you got a meeting, and so on. You're the one who's less available. 

##3. No texting while at work, during self-care, and after 10PM. 

Your time is extremely exclusive, and he has no permission to weasel himself into periods of time you're considered to be unavailable. No communication on work breaks, they're time for YOU. No communication on self-care time, this time is for YOU. If he does, IGNORE and only reply on your actual free time. If you concede and reply, you're teaching him that it's okay to push harder past your time boundaries. 

Beyond 10PM, men are up to no good; they become horny lil fucks. No catering to that. You're done and you don't do sexting or sending nudes (that provides him with fap material and demeans the need to wait for the first time you guys go in ""bed"" that is necessary for vetting) 

Also, not communicating while working projects a higher value image of you, you send off the message that you got priorities and a good work ethic, which are HV. 

##4. Don't be at his beck and call.

You're not his housemaid!?!!! You got a LIFE and he is not going to order you around or expect you to answer immediately. If you have difficulty with that, get your shit together and go do other stuff. 

You have to convey that you're inaccessible and that he has to work hard to access you. 

Also, this rule along with Rule 1: If he is sending you an answer 15 min later, take your sweet time and take 30 min to reply. Returning the same energy to the sender. If he ain't putting more effort into it you're pulling away. He has to work hard to keep the HVW you are around. 

Never ever ever send INSTANT replies. The man will see you're hooked to him and will lower his efforts to woo you because in his mind he's like ""oh, she is answering so fast, she was waiting for me, she's mine hahahaha no need to work harder"". If you have difficulty, DO STUFF. No waiting at the cellphone. You have a life, LIVE IT. 

##5. If he is ghosting you, let it go. Do not send any text or call him. You let it GO. 

Just a little text, it only takes 5-10 seconds to write. And it's dead easy to buy a new cellphone if ever the old one is broken (if he can't because he's broke, you don't wanna date him). He has NO excuse to not text you if he is in trouble. If it has been 2+ days, let it go. He's not interested and that's good because you only want interested fellas around you. 

Pickup artists often do ghosting as a way to provoke you into going Pickme for them. 

##6. Even if you have to fake it, make him see that you have a LIFE besides him. 

Abusers, rapists, PUAs, redpillers all prey on longely unconfident women because they're the MOST easy to manipulate into submission and insolation.

 HVM would see in a woman having a support&amp; friendship network as a sign of a whole woman that is not likely to become a desperate pickme clinger. 

To apply this rule: tell him some evenings that you're going at a friend's to watch movies or that you're doing a hike with a friend the upcoming weekend. The friend can be fictive. 

If you don't have friends and a support network, work on this as a priority because this is essential for safety, if ever you need to gtfo a shitty situation. Do not dismiss that, it is essential. 

##7. No question/conversation topic in the last few messages he did send? No reply. 

That's it. You're not the one leading the dance, he has. You're the one that must be seduced, woo'ed. He has to hook your attention, and if he is notputting in any effort to hook you, you're not hooked. That's it. 

##8. Ultimately, once you are beyond the initial dating stages, keep the calling &amp; texting to superficial topics and reserve the deeper and more interesting topics for IRL meetings. 

Quiproquos are so easy to have via texting&amp;calling, and they can sour the relationship. Body language/tone for deeper,  serious, critical topics, is absolutely essential and conveys so much more information than simple calls or texts. 

As a side effect, you'll be seen as someone interesting to meet, as the conversation will be captivating, and he will ask you to date again. 

Also this will help you avoid the penpal/silent IRL trap, as you both will have interesting topics to talk about on dates!

o26977,I'm devastated. TW Caroline's murderer was her husband.,"In case you're not familiar with the crime, it's one of the worst and the most violent crimes Greece has ever seen. The poor victim of that horrible crime was Caroline..

Caroline was a 20 year old student and mother and her husband Charalabos is a 32 year old pilot. 

At May 11 the greek police received a call from Charalabos. He claimed a robbery had happen. When police arrived at their house they found Charalabos tied up with duct tape and Caroline dead on their bed  *TW* strangled and with her 11 months old baby next to her.. trying to wake her up..

Also their dog...was killed and hanged from the straircase as well. Police was in shock. We were all in shock. 

As days passed and the police was searching for the ""robbers"" they realised things weren't adding up. They were no sings of robbery and the neighbors didn't hear anything weird. Caroline's smart watch that measured her pulses, showed that the time she was dead didn't match the time her husband said she was probably killed. He also claimed he had passed out from having his mouth and nose duct taped while Caroline was being killed by the ""robbers"", yet he somehow knew she was strangled to death. 


I honestly have no words to describe how much anger I feel right now. 
They met when Caroline was 16(!!!) And he was 28 and married when she turned 18. At 18 she had a miscarriage and he immediately tried for another baby.

 And the reason he killed her??? The reason he strangled her?? The reason he removed her life so brutally and killed and hanged their DOG?? She wanted to leave him.


She wanted a divorce. 

And instead of breaking up with her like two civilised adults, he decided THIS was better. He even attented her 40 day memorial (which is today) and HUGGED Caroline's mother and comforted her. 


Not even sure if this is even the correct place to post this..but I feel like we ought to remember Caroline and every Caroline out there. So please,

Remember to call out odd age gaps relashionships. (For hell's sake she was only 16 and he was 28 and no one thought this was weird??) 

Remember to point out your friends partner's violent behaviour and never make excuses for violent behaviours. If they hit objects, it's only a matter of time before they hit YOU. 

Remember to always point out red flags one can't see with their rose colored glasses. 

Remember to be safe. Please be safe. Always be safe. Vet for your partner like your life depends on it, cause most of the time it DOES. 

Rest In Peace dear Caroline..",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o26977/im_devastated_tw_carolines_murderer_was_her/,1623959912.0,670,0.97,73,FemaleDatingStrategy,Mcccy
o25z33,"A Case for ""Vanilla"" Sex","Sex and intimacy has been stolen from us.

It was stolen from us by the porn industry.

The porn industry has created perpetually more violent and obscene content year after year.

Porn has indoctrinated an entire generation of men and boys into seeing sex through the lens of the porn industry resulting in an increase of physical aggression towards women during sex.

Hardcore sex is now seen as mainstream while ""vanilla"" (LOVING) sex is mocked and made fun of.

**A MESSAGE TO MALE LURKERS:** *Sex is so much more that agressive penetrative jackhammering.*

Vanilla sex is not just Missionary Position.

Vanilla and Tantric sex allows you to explore the sensations of sex. It builds suspense in the body and as a result ***it increases the length and intensity of your orgasms dramatically,*** for both men and women.

It can include:

* Foreplay
* Clitoral/Head stimulation w/ oral or rubbing (Indirect/Rubbing around OR Direct/Lifting the hood)
* Music and Sex to the beat
* Edging (nearing orgasm and stopping only to start again)
* Tantra*
* Synchronized Breath Work
* Meditation
* Massages
* Mood Lighting
* Sensation Play
* Food and Drinks in the Bedroom
* Bathing/Showering Each Other
* Unique Settings
* Word Play (Not just dirty talk but describing sensations as you go.)
* Milking (woman massages penis using PC muscles inside the vagina)
* Spooning/Cuddling
* Full body exploration
* G-Spot or Prostate Play

*Several of these listed fall under tantra but I wanted to list them all individually.

Please share other methods of intimacy that you enjoy and I'll add them to the list above.

Fuck you kink and BDSM for ruining sex for us.

o25od2,Guide to Dating Single Dads,"I‚Äôve seen so many opinions on dating single dads here, but **the most concerning to me are the statements where people assume how much parenting time a man has directly relates to whether or not he is a HVM. This could not be more false, and is in fact, dangerous thinking**. I work quietly and under the radar in a strictly laywoman capacity in my local community to help women leave abusers, navigate the reality of the ABUSIVE court system, find housing, jobs, and any other way my small community of gorilla warrior feminists can help. I keep tabs on these women and their stories. Here are the disturbing truths I have learned:

Thanks to a commenter, I am reminded of the number one rule in dating single dads:

**NEVER EVER EVER date a single dad who is behind on child support.** Make him show proof.

**Potential Danger #1: Dads who have 50% parenting time.** A huge percentage of men who have 50% parenting are Cluster B men. They end up with the kids half time, because they went balls to the wall in court, dragged their ex through the mud, and sacrificed their children‚Äôs innocence and safety so they get some ‚Äúgood dad points‚Äù in the court of public opinion. Of course, ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù, but for me personally, this is a massive orange flag, and I dig deeper. These are the men who have ‚Äúa crazy ex‚Äù or ‚Äúshe abused the children, but I got screwed in court so I only got 50%‚Äù. I am extremely hesitant to engage with men who have 50% parenting time for these reasons. I know multiple women in my community who live this reality. More parenting doesn‚Äôt mean the man is a high value father.

**Potential Danger #2: Men who have little to no time with their children,** live half way across the country from their children, etc. These are the men I‚Äôve more often than not come across when I used to engage in online dating. ‚ÄúThe ex stole the kids‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs alienating them‚Äù or some other similar sob story. Sometimes THEY moved half way across the country away from their kids ON PURPOSE. These men make poor choices, and don‚Äôt put their own flesh and blood children before themselves. Do you think you, a mere woman, is going to fare any better? These men are the most likely to have hidden criminal records, or have engaged in substance abuse, abusive behavior, or other things that caused them to lose their children. They may say ‚Äúthey gave her sole custody, because that seemed best for the kids‚Äù. Rest assured, they are not generous benefactors, but likely lost legal custody for a reason. 

**Potential Danger #3: Men with multiple baby mamas.** I think this is pretty self explanatory. These men are often careless with birth control, breeder fetish men, and as one would expect, dead beat dads. Look out for multiple children close in age by different women. Don‚Äôt be his next pregnancy entrapment. Men who might be okay, are ones who had a teen pregnancy, and then later got married and did the family thing, and otherwise seem responsible. Be EXTREMELY WARY of any men who had an ‚Äúoops‚Äù baby over age 35. There are many. Can you imagine being so irresponsible with your sex life at that age? My experience with these types is that they are very ‚Äúpeter pan‚Äù. Potential Danger #4: The full time dad. Did he ‚Äúwin‚Äù in a corrupt court system against a protective mother? Or, is he one of the exceptionally rare cases of having a poor woman partner, and he is actually the best parent for the children?

**The single dads I think worth vetting against other FDS criteria:**

**Potentially Dateable Dad #1: The every other weekend dad.** Many of these dads are more emotionally involved in their children‚Äôs lives. They chose stability for their children over having to ‚Äúwin‚Äù some custody battle. Especially look for ones who agreed for the mother to keep the family home so the kids could stay in the same school district, and keep a good quality of life. These dads often try to make kids sports games, they show up for midweek dinner, and remember their kids birthdays. 

**Potentially Dateable Dad #2: The all summer and school holidays dad.** Effectively, this dad has approximately the same about of parenting time as Potentially Dateable Dad #1, but for some reason this schedule worked better. He makes an effort to be involved, video chats  w the kids, sends surprise gifts if they are far away from each other, and curtails his summer schedule so he can really focus on his children. 

**Potentially Dateable Dad #3: The full time/primary parent and widower.** These men need extra vetting as seen in ‚ÄúPotential Danger #4‚Äù, however, if they do come with a lot of green flags, they are potentially dateable. There are women who get into drugs, abuse alcohol, or other unsafe things, who really cannot parent children safely. These men often did their very best, but then had to leave, or the mother left them, or was committed to rehab/relapsed etc. **These men are a MINORITY**, but they do exist. I would personally ONLY date this kind of father if his actions are aligned with healing, leveling up, and providing stability for the family, AND he can articulate that. He should be proactive in getting the kids the help they may need. Widowers obviously went through a trauma, but as long as they are truly ready to move on and love again, they are potentially dateable, however, you will have kids FULL TIME if you marry this person, vet accordingly. It would be good if they had attended a grief group or therapy, or were some way proactive in their healing and helping their children cope.

**Final Caveat:** If you do not have children already, I DO NOT recommend dating single dads AT ALL.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o25od2/guide_to_dating_single_dads/,1623958459.0,201,0.88,85,FemaleDatingStrategy,sewingmachinesavior

Example: *""all men are horrible. They're not worth dating.""* *""He might seem high value now but all men are horrible and he's an LVM just hiding it.""* No telling other women they shouldn't date at all.

‚Ä¢ No femcel rhetoric

Example: *""I'm too ugly to date.""* *""No one will want to date me because I'm ugly.""* *""She must be really attractive or a man would never treat her that well.""* Demanding that FDS fix this for you or explain it to you, or tell everyone else not to date because you feel you can't. Crying about how it's not fair. 

Our subreddit is for dating and for leveling up, it is not for wallowing endlessly. If you want to be on this subreddit you have to work to level up or stop talking about it.

‚Ä¢ No outrage posting

Example: Posting screen caps or videos from Red Pill or incel forums, videos comment sections or subreddits. This is just negative and focusing on the worst of the worst. It doesn't help us at all. The only acceptable topic on this subject is how to spot a red pill or incel man by tactics they use. 

Stop posting screen caps of all these shitty stories on the other dating subreddits. We will still post an occasional one but *you* need to make a really good point which we expect in the title or body of the post or it will be removed. If there's a really crazy story like the nest guy or the snail guy we may make an exception.

‚Ä¢Spam

Example posting three video posts in one day or posting for screen caps in 2 hours. You will be banned. Permanently.

o1x8o7,FDS isn't about giving the benefit of the doubt. It's about being smart women who don't get played.,"I just saw a post where a man was engaging in creepy behavior obviously indicating he's dating more than one woman. People were responding and telling OP that ""maybe he has memory problems"" ""Maybe he's this or that."" 

FDS is about leveling up and not playing yourself anymore. Or getting played. You can't do that if you're so busy being nice and finding any legitimate reason for a man to do any sort of thing. 99% of the time these guys do not have a legitimate reason they're just creeps, losers and assholes. Playing yourself only makes it easier for men to play you.

Don't believe things men tell you at face value. If he is doing something creepy, weird or off putting don't ask him why because he already has a lie lined up meant to play on your sympathy. Accept that he is creepy, weird and off-putting and go date someone who isn't. There are plenty of men who aren't. 

That brings me to my next point, don't give men your sympathy. Dating isn't about sympathy, it's about finding a great partner for you and maybe you future children. You can't do that if you give chances to people because you feel bad or you feel like you should. Toughen up! Be a fox not a lamb. Lambs get eaten, foxes eat.

Dating is about you finding one single person who's great for *you*. You aren't a community resource. You aren't a toy. You aren't a gift. You aren't a thing that can be passed around to everyone who wants a chance.

o1wawr,In today‚Äôs episode of ‚Äúwhy gender equality does not mean gender agnosticism‚Äù: NiceGirls are not ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù as NiceGuys,"&gt; To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, the [Nice Girl](https://imgur.com/a/NscriVC) is far more likely to go out with a whimper and not a bang. As one Nice Girl on Reddit put it, her final move was quiet insight about men‚Äôs limitations, but also her own:

&gt; It took a lot of time to realize that it wasn‚Äôt selfless. I wanted it to pay off. I wanted them to turn around and realize they loved me someday, just like nice guys dream. Yeah, it wasn‚Äôt cool of the people taking advantage of it, but ultimately it was my fault for not having boundaries or self-respect.

I just read this [amazing article by Tracy Moore](https://medium.com/mel-magazine/the-female-version-of-a-nice-guy-isn-t-what-you-think-6a0192346506) on the phenomenon of the NiceGirl, and how she differs from the NiceGuy. She expertly summarizes why it feels so unjust to paint the two with the same brush:

&gt;  **because women generally lack the power to coerce men into relationships at will,** the privilege to expect to the same degree, and are generally inclined to internalize self-loathing for their shortcomings, it‚Äôs just less likely to manifest in violent demands, gross, oblivious sexual entitlement or the kind of intimidation or clueless pestering that makes women actually fear for their bodily autonomy or their lives.

&gt; For many women, the Nice Guy often **becomes their worst nightmare**, whereas the Nice Girl equivalent is more often a nuisance, the kind that can be swatted away like a pest. And in the end, rather than blow up at the object of desire ‚Äîor at the world, as so many rejected men have, all the while maintaining they are ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù ‚Äî **Nice Girls simply internalize the shame**.

This is really the crux of the issue. Women are not raised and indoctrinated into a society which puts our needs and wants above the needs and wants of the rest of humanity. We‚Äôre can‚Äôt even *imagine* a world in which that could be possible, let alone *expect* it as a matter of fact.. so we *certainly* don‚Äôt feel entitled to using our social status and physical strength as a means to intimidate and coerce others into complying. 


This vapid, uncritical desire to be ‚Äúfair and balanced‚Äù by sacrificing all social, physical and political context is really just another tool for the patriarchy to continue to gaslight us about our subjugation and mistreatment. The narrative shifts from, ‚Äúmany men use their patriarchal privilege to harass and intimidate women for daring to exercise their right to bodily autonomy while draping themselves in sheep‚Äôs clothing‚Äù to ‚Äúan evenly distributed group of men and women are just weird and can‚Äôt handle rejection. Haha what a bunch of weirdos‚Äù

o1t91p,Wholesome conversations I overheard my neighbour having with his (30 something) friends,"Yesterday was a hot night and my neighbour two yards down was having a BBQ with friends. I was working until late and couldn't wind down so I decided to continue painting my patio furniture around midnight and couldn't help but overhear their conversations. Last year in peak lockdown I overheard one of his friends say about not being able to date: ""I don't know what to do, I already finished Pornhub"" (while problematic, was kind of funny) and I wanted to hear if they could supply me with some more comedic yet problematic one liners like that.

There were some girls at the party and after they left the guys where really going deep, and talking about life and love. I might have missed some parts but everything I overheard sounded so healthy and mature. 

At one point I heard one guy talking about not wantig or needing more than a handful an I thought: gotcha!! Turns out they were talking about a specific dish. No mention of lady body parts whatsoever.

When everyone was ready to leave they insisted on helping the host clean up, at least a little bit. An they actually did, did not take no for an answer. And in return the host offered them a banana for the trip back... So wholesome!!

They were talking about how nowadays it's more difficult to find a relationship, because as you grow older the notion of 'love at first sight' is less and less prevalent. They talked about how it's hard to commit as fast as you did when you were younger. Not because they wanted to sleep around, but because they KNOW that once you commit, it's much more serious. They even agreed that even though it's not ideal, you can't lay claim on a woman before you actually commit. If she wants to date other people in the mean time, so be it. They wanted to be fully ready before committent and encouraged talking about it with the person you are dating in the meantime. They weren't talking about stringing along a girl for years but making a commitment after a third date was mentioned as an example for 'going a bit too fast'. Still, they weren't dismissing the girl, rather the talked about their wants and needs. The all expressed the desire to be in a healthy, long-term relationship.

One story stuck with me the most. One of the guys talked about the girl he was dating. He said he wasn't really feeling a romantic connection on the first two dated but the third one made up for it in a big way.   
Friends: So what changed?   
Him: Well, we had a **conversation** about it, but what changed most was that I took down the wall I had built. 

I thought: god, not another sob story about being hurt by a woman and taking years to 'heal'. Not this time. Turns out, he was dating a girl who broke up with him via text, 2 hours before his biggest exam, while his father had terminal cancer and had a few weeks left to live. That completely crushed him. But he wasn't even talking shit about her.   
Friends: Didn't she give you an STI?   
Him: Not relevant to the story.   
Friends: Yeah but how shitty is it to break up via text?  
Him: True, but not the point I wanted to make  
He didn't lash out. IN FACT, when he found out a couple of years later that HER mother had died of cancer as wel, he REACHED OUT. More conversations and mutual understanding ensued. In the mean time, he decided not to date seriously and work on himself. 

So what is the point of this post? I don't know, I just wanted to share. I will not go out on a limb and say these guys are HVMs but it was very refreshing to overhear these conversations and be pleasantly surprised about the other sex.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o1t91p/wholesome_conversations_i_overheard_my_neighbour/,1623922759.0,280,0.94,19,FemaleDatingStrategy,alxndrabo

As a matter of fact, it's a damn insult.","Background story: This ""friend"" propositions me for sex because I'm too ""wound up."" Then has the nerve to defend his actions and tell me he was, ""being nice"" and acts as if he's doing me a favour.

To lighten things up, he adds lol and lmao at end of every sentence. 

This conversation literally came out if nowhere. It went from, ""how are you doing?"" to ""When was the last time you had sex?"" 


I have no words. I cannot. Literally cannot. I feel bloody insulted. As a recovering pickmeisha, I admit that I still have problems setting boundaries at times. There are times I struggle and seek out validation and attention. I should have trusted my gut that this conversation was headed south. I felt uncomfortable the moment he asked about my sex life.

Needless to say, if a man ever tries to justify his actions with ""I'm being nice,"" just block him. He's not nice. I feel so dirty and cheap.

I'm insulted that he thinks I'm desperate enough to drive all the way there to sleep with him. 

Newsflash: I can get dick anywhere and anytime I want. I'm more than just a quick lay.

I've spent the last year working on leveling up and started dating casually a few months ago (post-vaccination) while following the FDS rulebook pretty strictly. I am seeing a man exclusively now, and I have never once had to think ahead about anything. 

Dinner? ""I remember you said you love oysters last week, I made a reservation at X oyster restaurant"". Breakfast? He's got espresso and fresh baked goods when I wake up. My birthday? He's already arranged a weekend away not just for me, but for my friends as well. When he invited me to a family party, he asked his mother ahead of time about the dress code, knowing I would want to know without my having to ask. This generosity and care extend to the bedroom as well. 

I also maintain my boundaries strictly, keeping up with my friends, hobbies, and work-life, and limiting our time together to 2-3 days a week keeps us excited to see each other, and keeps him on his toes. It is attractive to have your own life ladies. 

I am still vetting this man, but regardless, FDS has seriously raised my standards and improved my life not just in dating but also in friendships and career.

o1llst,"The Four Tolkien LVM Characters and What We Can Learn from Them, Part 1","I don‚Äôt normally post here but I‚Äôm on the FDS discord and we got to talking about the men in Tolkien‚Äôs literature. To put it mildly, I‚Äôm a huge fan of Tolkien‚Äôs writing and can talk a lot about it, and upon discovering FDS was happy to note that the men of his writing were actually pretty damn high value. However, there are four notable examples of LVM in the canon and I thought I could write out HOW they were low value, what behaviors they exhibit that your average non-fictional scrote would also be doing, and what these characters say about toxic masculinity. The discord said that this would be fun, so here I am posting part 1 of my weird dissertation. Also, if I annoy sexist male Tolkien fans, that‚Äôs a bonus. 

When we think about high value men in fiction, there are a few go-to answers, but the first one I always see is Aragorn, son of Arathorn from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And to be honest, that‚Äôs totally valid. Aragorn is a once and future king who not only earns that title, but he actually deserves it. Another answer from that same series is Samwise Gamgee, loyal friend and canonical best husband in the series. The more you think about the Lord of the Rings, though, the more you realize just how many high value men are in that series. Even the most flawed men in that trilogy end up being high value in the end. This is not just true of the Lord of the Rings, this is true of the entire expanded Tolkien universe as well. Venture into the Hobbit and you have Bilbo and Thorin (when he‚Äôs not dealing with gold sickness), not to mention the rest of the cast. The Silmarillion, arguably Tolkien‚Äôs most important work, is full to bursting with high value men. 

I could go on all day about these fictional men, write a dissertation laying out the evidence for why they are high value men. However, we know this to be true as soon as we look at the material, and going through all of that probably won‚Äôt yield any information that we don‚Äôt already know. What we can learn from are Tolkien‚Äôs rare, but important low value men. There aren‚Äôt many, but there are four that embody low value behavior so classic that we see that behavior mirrored in real life LVM. From there, we can learn something new about low value men in general, but how low value behavior bleeds through generations and what high value men ultimately think of low value men.

A disclaimer: the summaries of the plot lines surrounding these LVM (or low value elves, as three out of four of these guys are elves) are not going to be super comprehensive, but there will be spoilers, so be forewarned. 

**FEANOR: The Worst Renaissance Man**

The first man we‚Äôre going to talk about is the elf, the myth, the legend, Feanor son of Finwe. Born the eldest son of the first High King of the Noldor living in Valinor (basically elf heaven). Feanor‚Äôs spirit was so out there and exceptional that it literally sapped his mother‚Äôs will to live after childbirth. Finwe remarries after an appropriate mourning period and has two sons with his second wife, Fingolfin and Finarfin, both high value men. Feanor takes to these new brothers like oil and water and there‚Äôs a lot of bad blood there. He marries the elf maiden Nerdanel, the daughter of a elf craftsman, and he learns a whole bunch about craftsmanship from his father-in-law. Unfortunately, he treats his wife pretty terribly: he has seven sons with her (all of whom were varying degrees of low value and require their own analysis) and ends up leaving her in the only example of elvish divorce I can think of in the canon. 

Now, even before we get into Feanor‚Äôs main acts of fuckery, we can see some red flags. One, Feanor is very threatened by men seen as his equal. His enmity with Fingolfin, the eldest son of his dad‚Äôs second marriage, was so bad that after a fight, Feanor got exiled from Valinor. Two, and perhaps most importantly, in a story spanning thousands of years filled with elves and men in love with fantastic women, Feanor‚Äôs marriage is the only one that isn‚Äôt described that way. It really comes off like he married Nerdanel so he could have his kids and learn from her father-in-law, and that he genuinely sees women as tools for his goals, even the women who are literal goddesses. 

Feanor goes on to make the three Silmarils, jewels that literally have the light of heaven and earth inside them. More accurately, they have the light of the Two Trees (think the sun and moon, but much brighter) inside them. We don‚Äôt know what he used to complete the project, but we do know that he tried to hit up his niece, Finarfin‚Äôs daughter Galadriel (yes, that Galadriel) for a lock of her hair because he was legitimately obsessed with it, and her. This is another example of how women are tools to Feanor, and also *fucking ew.* Regardless, though, he gets it done and is quite rightfully lauded as the greatest craftsman the elf world has ever and will ever know. He locks them up in his vaults with all of his other creations, where they remain until Morgoth, the most evil being alive (Sauron was his loyal and obedient servant, to paint a picture of just how evil Morgoth is), sneaks into the city and drains the trees of their light with the help of the nastiest spider ever. When asked by Yavanna, the literal goddess of nature that made the trees, if he would give up the Silmarils to help restore the trees, Feanor says no, because he made them and they‚Äôre his and they‚Äôre wrong to even ask him that. 

Ultimately and inevitably, the Silmarils are stolen anyway (and Finwe gets killed, which is pretty sad), which leads Feanor, now king of the Noldor, to swear an oath to the highest god this world has to pursue them until he gets them back. His sons take the same oath, so the whole family is now involved in Feanor‚Äôs bad decision making. Feanor then leads an uprising against the gods and takes a good chunk of the Noldoran population (including Galadriel, which is how she ends up in Middle Earth, and most of the extended family) out of Valinor and into Middle Earth proper. 

On the way there, the party reaches the main harbor Feanor asks the king of a different elf race (there‚Äôs a lot of lore there that you don‚Äôt need for the LVM lesson, just think of them as distant relations) to borrow their boats and the king says no, because they‚Äôre his and he made them and he‚Äôs wrong to even ask that of him. Feanor takes this as well as you‚Äôd expect and slaughters everyone at the harbor in a genocide known as the Kinslaying of Alqalonde. Upon arrival into Middle Earth, Feanor gets into a fight with an army of Balrogs (remember that thing Gandalf fought in the movies? Imagine an army of those) and slaughters them, but he dies as well, leaving his sons to pick up the pieces for the next several hundred years. 

Now that‚Äôs by no means a truly comprehensive summary of Feanor‚Äôs life and LVM behavior, but there are several points where Feanor‚Äôs status as an LVM might be argued because of his long list of accolades, and I wouldn‚Äôt blame you for doubting me. Sure, he achieves great things. He makes the most beautiful stones of all time, he invents an alphabet, and he crafts the palantir system, which is basically just a magical telephone system, just to name a few things. The guy was a badass. However, he was inherently low value, and there are behaviors he exhibits that you can catch real life LVM doing. 

Some red flags to look for if you think you‚Äôre dealing with a Feanor: 

- He has no respect for anyone as an equal. If he can‚Äôt be around other men without feeling a need to compete or bring them down, that‚Äôs an issue. 
- He has no respect for *women* as an equal. Many LVM respect other men, but if he can‚Äôt name one woman he respects that is not a relative or a celebrity? üö©üö©üö©
- He can‚Äôt be told no, or worse, you‚Äôre afraid to say no to him.  Think about what happened the last time he heard no. 
- He keeps enablers as company. Feanor‚Äôs father Finwe was high value in how he treated both of his wives, but he was a doormat for Feanor and took his side in everything, even when Feanor got into a physical fight with Fingolfin. His sons took the oath and never questioned it until later because they supported him so much. Look at your man‚Äôs friends. Do they tell him about himself? Are they comfortable being honest with him? Do you find yourself editing your words so they settle with him better? 
- You find yourself blinded by his achievements and ignoring when he treats you badly. You make excuses for his behavior because he‚Äôs doing great and important things and giving him a pass for those things. 
- He has double standards for himself and everybody else. Sure, he can hang onto his greatest creation even if giving it up serves the world, but the second someone does the same and it doesn‚Äôt benefit him, instant slaughter. Your LVM probably isn‚Äôt committing genocide, but watch out for those little and sometimes very big disparities. 

Feanor may have been Tolkien‚Äôs Renaissance man, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from being a grade A LV douchebag. He was so low value that his seven sons all ultimately inherited some element of their father‚Äôs shittiness, twisting it in brand new ways and spreading LVM behavior across their world. However, the most prominent and obvious example of how LVM make more LVM if left unchecked lies elsewhere in the Silmarillion, in a story set long after Feanor‚Äôs death.

o1jqan,My dirty secret to dating men who are clean and tidy.,"So, I'm a messy person, totally disorganized. I marvel at my girl friends with gorgeous, decorated, tidy homes. Everything has a place. I WISH that could be me, I have tried! Now, I don't leave a trail of destruction where ever I go, but in my personal space things go where I put them, where ever that happens to be. Oh, I know where everything is, there is just no rhyme or reason to an outside onlooker. Now I KNOW I'm messy, and I don't expect that people accept it. My own home is MINE and that seems to be how I find these neat guys. 

I don't hide it. Guys find out quick, I ain't cleaning. I won't be cleaning his mess, in fact I see a mess as something intentional, he must totally want it JUST like he left it. If I move ANYTHING, he won't know what happened. If you've ever ""tidied"" the space of someone like me you'll be quick to see their brain explode when they just come to find all their stuff GONE. ""it's put away"" No. It's gone. Just emptiness is left. 

I've had caring men clean my house, organize my belongings and try to keep me on ""track"". Men who USE women for housework move right along when encountering me. I'm not suggesting you be like me, like I said, I wish I had a system (I have ADHD). But don't you dare touch his mess. If he can't be in your space and respect the rules, he can't be in your space.

She even said that guys that couldn't pay would be embarrassed and that they wouldn't date if they couldn't afford it. She also said that my grandpa would have groups of couples get together and he would bring her along, they'd go bowling, swimming, to the movies and carnivals and he always paid and made sure she had a nice time. 

I told her how lately I've been lonely and how I would eventually like to find someone, and how I've been healing, but still am not ready to out myself back out there after the trauma of dating before. I told her the story of how the guy that was an old classmate took me to a really wonderful first date and then did a 180 on the 2nd date, was late, dressed sloppy, was inappropriate and trash talked a previous woman, and then made me pay for the movie. 

She said that my grandpa and the other guys she knew would never have spoken like that or acted like that on dates and that it is crazy that so many guys act like this today.

You don't go to mcdonalds as a date!"" She started getting really upset. 

I told her how im not about to take my time and use it to get all dolled up, drive out of my way to meet a man, just to go to a coffee shop, and may for my own drink, to ""date"" a man. She agreed and said she wouldn't either. ""What's the point of that?"", she said. I told her I'd much rather get coffee alone or meetup with a friend and even then I'd buy the friends coffee. ""These guys should be embarrassed,"" she said.

She went onto to say, ""I don't understand why women would even bother dating today. I wouldn't! I would just get a dog!"" It hits home you know. She was seriously riled up and upset about it. Her marriage with my grandpa wasn't perfect, but even she understands that women these days are being duped into a bad deal with dating and sham marriages. I trust FDS, but hearing it from my grandma (who doesn't even use the internet and has never heard of FDS) is just another reassurance that we aren't ""crazy/ gold diggers /unreasonable/prudes/ or have too high of standards."" 

I'm tired of it and even though I get lonely I refuse to deal with a leechy man baby. It's not hard to get a roomate or find online pen pals that are platonic. I want to start volunteering again and will when restrictions /closures stop.

o1gwx8,First date fail,"Hi ladies

Today I went on a date with someone from OLD (yes I know! I feel like a ü§°) I‚Äôve only been on the app a month and he was my first date with someone from OLD. He is local and I thought he looked and seemed nice so I went for it when he asked me out.

I wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered. 

The first red flag üö© is that he pushed the time of the date back by 30 mins with just a few hours‚Äô notice. When we eventually met outside the pub that HE chose, it turned out that he did not make a reservation even though he said he would üö© üö© 

It meant we had to sit on a public bench outside the pub on the riverside. Sounds lovely and quaint but it was surrounded by flies buzzing around and a massive hole in the pavement behind the bench where builders had been digging. There were builders‚Äô barriers erected and everything. It wasn‚Äôt pleasant, and I felt like a fool sitting there on a date. 

It has been pretty hot in the UK recently but it started to rain loads. I got wet after I had spent the whole day getting ready for the date. 

He turned up in an okay outfit but with sunburn and severe acne all over his nose (he didn‚Äôt have that in his photos and he‚Äôs nearly 40). I wouldn‚Äôt mind so much about acne normally ‚Äî but the low-effort of the actual date made me so annoyed that he thought it was ok to turn up like that. 

I feel like such a ü§° for going through all the effort of looking nice but then ending up horribly disappointed by the end of the date. He didn‚Äôt even bother asking me questions that mattered, and he just looked like he couldn‚Äôt be arsed about me.

By the time the rain got too heavy, he asked me what my plans were now and I said that I‚Äôd better be heading back home. The date lasted one hour. 

I feel disappointed that he could not plan a proper date, and that I even accepted it in the first place. 

I know that it‚Äôs FDS rules not to use OLD, and now I see why. I was just a number to him. Even though he asked me on a date with five days notice, he couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to plan it properly. 

The conversation was dry. He turned out to be quite sheltered and boring. He didn‚Äôt know the most basic things about his home country and seemed quite detached from his heritage. He also dropped into the convo about a relationship being about ‚Äúgetting on the property ladder together‚Äù but he seemed shocked when I mentioned how important my pension is to me. Shows he‚Äôs looking for a Barbara the Builder. Not gonna be meeee.

Now I know that FDS rules are there to protect us from low effort shit like this. I feel mainly angry and upset with myself

I think I‚Äôm going to delete the OLD app as I don‚Äôt think I can go through this low effort shit again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o1gwx8/first_date_fail/,1623881211.0,219,0.93,46,FemaleDatingStrategy,scorpiorising33
o1ensp,Why I am saying NO to OLD - a lil reflection and thoughts,"So okay. I really didn't expect to make such a post, I really had high hopes for OLD, I thought this would be just a numbers game, keep on swiping right or left, messaging, doing dates etc etc. Ya know the whole motion, everybody knows and does it.  But ultimately I feel like this is artificial, too unnatural, forced. .

The dates I met tried so hard to find common ground we could converse on but the thing is, it can be pretty hard to find some common interests, and if we do find, often it's at differing levels, like I might have a mild interest in biology, but my date would be an absolute NERD at it. Unnatural and both try awkardly to make it work desperately. Both KNOW why they did meet, and there's not much natural relationship evolution.

After my last Tinder date (that turned out to be shite), I thought to myself... Would a HVM go on OLD, a website that's marketed as a ""sex market"" to men? Would a HVM go swipe for 30 min while on the toilet bowl? Would a HVM spend so much time on OLD?

I've seen ads for OLD apps, and the ads destined to men tend to have tons of women, all ethnicities, supermodel pretty. It kinda transmits this message ""we have all those women available for YOU"". Men don't see OLD as a means to get meaningful relationships, they see it as a sex market. 

In comparison, the OLD app ads for women only show ONE man and a woman, being happy together, all nice and good ü§° seems like women are being sold a lie too. 

I think this HVM would start off by focusing on himself and his interests... Participate in clubs, group activities, etc that are centered around his interests, or meet people in parties in his friendship circles. Avoiding time wasters like social media and OLD. 

The LVM would go on OLD, because it's ***convenient as hell***, just swipe a few times, message someone, then with a lil bit of TEXTING a pussy comes to you! That's the ultimate LVM dream, some lowcost/free pussy. That's probably why we see so many LVM/NVM dudes on OLD, besides the fact they compose the majority of the population. Those same LVM are less likely to congregate in hobbies (it requires effort!) and IRL meeting situations, those demand too much effort, and as we know, the LVM wants to do the bare minimum effort. Bare bare. Minimum. Effort.

Aka dating junkfood. 


Those LVM are getting access to us Queens, HVW, that normally would be inaccessible to them pre-OLD. For them it's a INCREDIBLE opportunity. They can date women that have it together and parasite them off. 

##**I thought: What about I skip all together OLD, save that emotionnal/mental energy and time, and redirect into more furfilling activities, and coincidentally meet more HV people?** 

I've felt like OLD was using a lot of my time, between my two jobs, school, personal life, my hobbies, and such. And I'd rather meet someone IRL so I can already vet him in person. There's only so much you can vet through texting, men can fake HVness via texting for so long, already wasting my time and energy, till we meet and they turn out to be awkard/silent/LV/NV/bum ugly/obese/different from the pictures. Also the endless attacks they sent me brought a wind of negativity, even though I block&amp;delete them my vibe was getting affected. 

So I decided to go fully OLD-free now and focus on more natural means of meeting people, for sure this is gonna be less convenient for meeting potential candidates...

But when most candidates are mediocre at best, is it really worth it?.

Flakey people for the most part are often using you to buffer their social life.  They‚Äôve got their ‚Äúclique‚Äù- their established friends and family who they do reciprocate with and show up for.  They are getting their emotional needs met so flaking on you doesn‚Äôt affect them deeply.  

It doesn‚Äôt feel good when people keep you ‚Äúon the bench‚Äù because they have ‚Äúmore important‚Äù people to play with.  They may not say any of that explicitly but you aren‚Äôt crazy if that is how it makes you feel.  It‚Äôs amusing to me that people will claim they‚Äôre sooooo busy as a reason to flake on me and then post extensively on their social media about all of their leisure activities üßê. Just like with men who think that they can come in and out of your life, women who do this are a no go for intimate relationships.

Don‚Äôt let people standard shame you.  Some people like having tons of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with whom they keep things easy and casual.  I‚Äôm not one of those people.  I prefer a handful of girlfriends that are reliable and that I can see on a somewhat consistent basis.  

‚ÄúBut if I filter the flakey people from my life, I will have no friends?!‚Äù  If someone flakes on you for coffee or a mellow hang, then it is highly unlikely that they deserve the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù designation.  A friend will show up for you if you break your leg or get cancer.  If someone cannot be reliable for the bare minimum coffee hang or ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù (platonic relationships only!  You know how I feel about ‚Äúcoffee dates‚Äù.) then you will never grow into a deeper relationship with them that will feel satisfying to your soul.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o1dhut/on_loneliness_addressing_both_platonic_and/,1623872475.0,153,0.92,10,FemaleDatingStrategy,Aocwannabe

jw3yr0,A Low Value Man Walks Into a Museum‚Ä¶ | Why You Shouldn't Give a Shit About What Men Think of Your Clothes,"This was inspired by a comment chain in a removed thread, but it sparked an interesting discussion. 

The post in question showed an influencer wearing a cropped tank and some boyfriend jeans. Nothing outside the norm, where I live. She was explaining that she wanted to be able to dress the way she liked. She wanted to be seen as hot and sexy, but not *sexualized*. Men, and some women, took issue with this. 

**""How can you expect men not to sexualize you when you dress like *that*?""** Men ask. Easily, fuckface.

Can you ladies appreciate that a woman or man is attractive and desirable without sexualizing them? It's pretty simple, in my experience. 

Like do these men just walk into the Louvre and think ""Venus de Milo. What a fucking slut."" orrr?

Clothing doesn't imply anything about morals or consent. I personally don't find any kind of ""empowerment"" in showing a lot of skin, but women should be allowed to dress how they like and men should simply learn to control themselves and their idiotic thoughts. 

Men will continuously push the bar on what is or isn't considered ""revealing"" regardless of what women do. If every woman in the world took to wearing nothing but turtlenecks and shapeless trousers tomorrow, men would find a way to sexualize it. If your sleeve ever rolled up slightly above the wrist, they'd say you looked like a whore. Among the Amish, showing your ankles is considered slutty. Can you imagine considering a *bare ankle* to be indicative of promiscuity? Men sound equally insane to me when they lose their minds over a bare midriff or short skirt. Men will sexualize certain *hairstyles* for god's sake. Pigtails? They call them ""*handlebars*,"" FFS. Dye your hair a bright color? Guess that makes you a ""*freak*."" 

Keep in mind, often what is or isn't considered ""slutty""/""revealing"" depends largely on your natural body type, race, height, facial structure and other factors that are impossible control. Any woman who has had to survive school uniforms inherently understands this. 

Validating men's porn-fueled delusions by putting any stock into what they believe is ""sexual"" is aiding and abetting the patriarchy. 

In short: Dress conservative if you want to. Dress ""revealing"" if you want to.

As long as you're dressing for *your* comfort and not for male validation, you're on the right track.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jw3yr0/a_low_value_man_walks_into_a_museum_why_you/,1605654793.0,241,0.96,34,FemaleDatingStrategy,ManchurianCantaloupe

jvxdjy,Types of shitty sae that need to die with the patriarchy,"Types of shitty sex that need to die with the patriarchy


The quickie

Generally what this means to men is no foreplay for the woman and no orgasm for the woman. Just stuffing in his dick and doing what he wants until he orgasms in 2 to 5 minutes. It is abusive and degrading. This never used to be a thing. Nobody gets to hurt you sexually and that includes hurting your sexuality by using you like a masturbation sock.


The birthday present

I remember this one showing up on the TV show Friends when I was a kid. Thanks for all the sexually abusive indoctrination, Friends! Your body isn't a ""gift"" or present for any man because you aren't a thing. What bothers me particularly about this archetype of patriarchally invented sex is that it positions sex on the man's birthday as almost a *right* that he has. No one has an unquestioning right to *your* body no matter what day it is. The other unacceptable factor is the idea that he should get whatever he wants for his birthday. And that means using your body whatever way he pleases. Whether it's anal rape, violent oral deep throating rape, or some other nasty degrading shit he'd like to do to you. You never hear women talking about how they are going to finally get to rape their husband anally on their birthday. This should not be sexually exciting for men. And it certainly isn't for women.


Make-up sex

No I don't want to fuck you after just having a fight! And I'm not going to have sex with you after you have insulted me or shirked your duties like I'm your servant. There is actually a whole section in Lundy Bancroft's book on abusive men, *Why Does He Do That?*, where he discusses the abuser pushing for make-up sex. They do it either to reassert control over the woman, to harm and degrade her sexually, or to make themselves feel better about the abuse they just perpetrated against her. It also smacks of the cycle of abuse where he first blows up and then you both make up again and again.


The hate fuck

This one is just disgusting and unforgivable. It is also pretty new having showed up in the last 10 years or so. It is absolutely 100% influenced by sexually violent internet porn. It is a twisting of sex to be the opposite of what it should be, which is about love and care and mutuality.


Fight fuck

This is basically every sex scene in every show and movie for the last decade plus. No sweetness, no tenderness, no soft kissing, no foreplay. It's the scene where the man attacks the woman and slams her against the wall and then shoves his mouth at her, rips her clothes, then he throws her on the bed and immediately sticks his dick in and fucks her. We are supposed to believe this is enjoyable for the woman. (We already know it is for the man) Happens to look exactly like rape as well and yet we are being told it's consensual. This is meant to fuck with women's minds, make no mistake. Think of the number of young women being raped just like this their first time or by their first boyfriend and thinking it's okay and normal because it's all they ever see.


The on your period blowjob

WHY??? Will he *die* if you don't service him sexually for a few days every month?  Fuck off while I menstruate! The entitlement! This one should be an immediate dump, no more chances. He's telling you that he thinks your job is to sexually service him no matter what you feel like. He is showing you that he thinks one-sided sex is perfectly acceptable as long as it is for him. He is also telling you he thinks your body is too disgusting to go near it while you are menstruating.


The strip tease surprise

Ugh! Do I even have to? I'm not a performing sex monkey. When are you doing a sexy dance in a banana hammock for me, dude? Probably never. of all the things we have to be in relationships with men now we have to be sexual performers as well? Just no. You get enough already sexually.  


Car sex

Whoever thought this was a good idea? Probably only teenagers because it's fucking uncomfortable and creepy. There's no need to be 30 having sex in a car like you see on TV. *Go to your home that you pay for* to have sex like adults. 


Maintenance sex

This might as well just be called maintenance rape. Let's face it. Anytime you're forcing yourself to have sex that you don't want and you don't like you are damaging your sexuality and thus damaging your relationship with that person. Eventually it will have a cumulative effect on your mental and sexual health and cause things like vaginismus or sex repulsion and your relationship will die. Women are not sex vending machines. If you don't want to have sex with your partner that is a message from your body that you should be listening to. It's either a problem in the relationship or possibly a physical problem, and both require attention.


Post natal blow jobs

Apparently this is all the rage among the porn addict abusers. Demanding daily blowjobs until the woman's vagina is back in service. This fits with the one third of millennial women that are now being raped by their male partner in the six weeks following giving birth when they are supposed to be healing. (Don't worry the study I quoted that from doesn't call it rape! Can't have that now can we? s/)


Sex for him doing chores

*See ""birthday sex"" above.

This is some weird Mommy perverted sex shit. Little baby boy gets sex from Mommy for behaving like an adult for 10 minutes? Nasty! We are not rewards for men. Our *bodies* are not rewards for men. We are not adult men's mommies. Don't make yourself his mommy if you ever want respect from him or you have any sexual attraction to him.


Sex coupon (rape pass)

*See ""birthday sex"" and ""sex for chores"" above. 

Men don't get access to you body through promises of future sex on your part. Future sex can not be promised or contracted. We always have the right to say no. I'm not going to put myself in a position where I have a fight with my man and he comes out with a sex coupon for anal. Nope! Hell to the nah! Also my rape/sexual consent/sexual degradation isn't an item a man can pick up off a shelf at the grocery store.


None of these degrading types of ""sex"" were a thing 20 years ago. Don't let the patriarchy coerce you into being sexually degraded or raped. 

Final note: Every one of these is a red flag in a future partner. It tells you how he sees you, your body, and your sexuality. As a thing that exists to serve him regardless of how it negatively affects you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jvxdjy/types_of_shitty_sae_that_need_to_die_with_the/,1605634732.0,457,0.92,98,FemaleDatingStrategy,positive_acct

* Age gap relationship
* She does all the work. He's too lazy to even organise the joint mortgage
* Wants to ""stay friends"" when they split 2 years later... and stay in the house with her.
* "" Eventually he didn't want me to come over to stay in my own home and I didn't feel too safe as he completely changed. "" She moves back in with her parents.

jvii40,FDS Handbook has opened eyes to my parents' dysfunctional relationship and more...,"Let me start off by saying: Hello, how are you? Hopefully, you're having a great day :) I've recently found this community and am glad that I joined.

My parents have gotten married over 25 years ago, mom had my brother at 21 to keep my dad from running off with other women, mom treats my dad like a child who can't do anything for himself, and at the end of the day they married because they told me when I was 14 that ""they didn't have a choice"". I scratched my head because they both did have many choices. My parents do love each other but not in a mature way I would say. My mom cooks, cleans, and doesn't work for money. My dad is the one with a 9-5 job and he often puts my mom down because she doesn't work for money even though she likes being a homemaker only. Good god. I cringe.

I checked up on my parents recently and it saddens me to know that nothing changes and it will never change. When I was a teenager (currently in my mid-20's), I thought their relationship was healthy and meaningful and over the years I realized that it wasn't. FDS handbook confirmed that.

Apart from that, I've been reflecting on how over the years I've felt bad about myself because I never gravitated towards being in a relationship. I forced myself to be one in the past because I saw how my friends have gotten engaged and married and my extended family members have looked at me strangely and looked down at me when they learned that I didn't have a partner. I stopped feeling this way around six months ago and stopped giving a damn what others think about me and my life.

jvcl53,How a real man asks for and accepts help.,"My LVM ex once asked for ""help"" wrapping presents for his family... yes, I am creative and awesome at gift wrapping but it felt like more of a ""You're my girlfriend so now you get to do all the woman-type stuff FOR me"" statement than a respectful asking for help. He just handed me the gifts and the wrapping paper and took off and I felt used and pissedoff. But once I did one chore for him,  I opened Hell's Doorway.....

I got many more instances of the LVM ex wanting ""help"" as a thinly veiled excuse to dump ""female type stuff"" on me. I got volunteered to bake weekly muffins for his office team. I got asked to do his clothes shopping FOR him. All under the guise of ""I need your help"" 

It would make me furious, but if I refused I'd get the butthurt whining that ""I never want to help him"" .... yeah I still can't believe I put up with two years of his nonsense. 

Then comes my new guy.....

The ""New Dude"" very early on in dating called to ask if I felt like coming over to help him on a car fixing problem he just couldn't get to work by saying ""I know you know your shit, I'm really stuck on this and I would really appreciate your help.""  Turns out it was sensors and I won't bore the non-car people getting technical but sensors are a right bastard and while I can do them better than most thanks to that godawful Nissan I had for years.... yeah it was still a tough problem. 

And for my help I got mega gracious thanks, a growler of fancy beer and it turned into our very first ""garage day"" together and it was wonderful. The ""New Dude"" stuck around, held the light for me, fetched tools, asked me to show him HOW I fixed it. He really wanted HELP. He was truly grateful. We worked TOGETHER. 

(Plus it's so damn rare to find a man who doesn't feel emasculated by a woman having ""manly"" skills and will also acknowledge that your ""manly"" skills might be better than his own.)

He also reciprocated the very next weekend by coming over and using his house electrical expertise ( he's got his Journeyman status in electrical stuff so I know HE knows HIS shit too) ... and he helped to fix a glitch in my garden lights that I've been annoyed by for a long time but couldn't manage after a million tries to fix myself and was too stubborn to pay to get it done. 

He wasn't the least bit condescending while showing me what I'd messed up on and how to fix similar problems again.  So we got a ""yard day"" together, and we both enjoyed it. 

Asking for help doesn't mean you throw your problem at someone and expect them to make everything perfect. It means you let someone else take the lead, but you still hold up your end of working on the problem. 

I wish more men knew how to ask for and accept help. Maybe there should be a training manual on that?

The ex-demon put on a show for a bit although I ignored many red flags from the beginning. It was his constant referring to our ""honeymoon period"" when we got into arguments (over him being mean to me or belittling/disrespecting me) that really got to me.

I'd counter with something like ""you were nicer/calmer when we first met, everything felt better"" 

He'd respond with ""that was our honeymoon period, of course it was all rainbows and sugar""

jv9rl5,Love Languages,"Does anyone else find the concept of love languages to be a bit strange? In my opinion, a HVM should be demonstrating all 5 love languages to you consistently. All 5 things (physical touch, gifts, acts of service, words of affirmation, quality time) are invaluable to a healthy, loving relationship. You can't not have some of these things, they absolutely all must be present. 

I've heard LVM who are aware of the love languages use them as excuses for treating their woman in a sub-par way for example saying things like: ""I'm not great at gift-giving, it's not my love language"". This is bullshit, even if a man is not a great gift-giver by nature, when they get into a relationship, they should feel the urge as a man to shower their woman with gifts. at the very least, even if he doesn't get that natural urge, he should understand the needs of women, we all want to be given gifts to some degree, and make a concerted effort to please her. The same goes for every other love language too. ""that's not my love language"" is never an adequate excuse, and again even if certain behaviors in the love languages are unnatural to men, they should want to do all of those things for a woman they love, or at the very least pick up on their woman's discontentment when those things aren't present, and change their behavior. 

I've also noticed that for women, their love language is more often than not whatever they were missing in their last relationship. For example, my ex wouldn't be affectionate with me publicly and this was the source of most of our fights. I was super consciously aware that he'd never hold my hand or put his arm around me at parties. When I first met my HVM now boyfriend, I noticed that he right away would hold my hand and put his arm around me in public. This meant sooo much to me because I was so aware that this was something my ex did not do for me, and so I would think to myself ""physical touch is my love language"". After about 6 months of dating my HVM boyfriend, I realized that obviously I loved and required physical touch, but that realistically, physical touch is a base level need in a relationship, not a love language. It's also not a substitute for other love languages, and I only really was so attuned to it before because I didn't have it in the past. 

Pickmes will subtly shame other girls whose love language is gift-giving or acts of service because they require actual effort and action. This is mostly a cope for them not having boyfriends who will buy them thoughtful gifts or do things for them. If your man isn't doing these things it's not a good sign, regardless of what your ""preferred"" love language is, as 99% of women enjoy being given gifts and having chores/tasks done for them. Don't accept a relationship without these qualities. 

Words of affirmation is the most pickme love language. That shit is base level. You absolutely CANNOT have a relationship without words of affirmation. Like I said, all love languages are necessary in a good relationship, but words of affirmation especially. When someone loves you, they want to gush over you and dote on you. If they're not doing this they are NOT into you. Period. Girls who have this love language were oftentimes in relationships with LVM previously who withheld complimenting them/saying I love you and used it as a weapon. Words of affirmation is a MINIMUM STANDARD. Even more so than the other languages. 

TLDR: a relationship with a HVM will automatically have most or all of these love languages already present, and words of affirmation is an absolute must no matter what. Don't let LVM (or your inner pickme) rationalize mediocre treatment to you because ""it's not their love language""",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jv9rl5/love_languages/,1605544201.0,213,0.96,54,FemaleDatingStrategy,curlysoosh

jv9hfw,Double standards have controlled my life.,"This morning I woke up to my brother throwing a tantrum like a toddler. He is 17. He was yelling and wining about his classes. He usually reacts like this towards things that don't go his way. I never thought anything of it when I was younger but recently I have been actively learning and fighting against the patriarchy. This has brought me to realize how despicable his behavior is, and my parents let this happen. My mom babies him and my dad just doesn't pay attention. I can remember from a young age the favoritism in my house. My brother was always given more and my and my sister were SOL. My mom harassed my sister about so much to the point where she purposely acted out. She even ran away many times and moved out at age 16 to get away from the house. I remember always hearing my mom talking about her clothes. I internalized a lot of the things she said to her. For years I was terrified to be feminine because of what my mom had said. We were not allowed to where red nail polish or lipstick because men would stare at us. My mom told me that when I was 5. I am barely letting myself be feminine again because I know that if I let it control me I will forever be insecure and sad. All of the things that society has told me, my mom pushed them to me more. I developed an eating disorder for a while, never got diagnosed like the rest of my mental issues that probably should be, but I still deal with it today. I hate my relationship with food but it's not my fault. I was raised to this. I was conditioned to be this way. This is not my fault, but I am gonna fix it. I am gonna pick myself up and put me back together.

jv55f8,Is it bad of me to really want Karma to strike my ex hard multiple times?,"Ex talked about me being single as something very disappointing. He said ""I am ruining people's lives by being single"" I still didn't get what he was trying to imply by that.
While, he couldn't himself bear to remain single, with every last bye and block, he finds a way to come back and bother me, like he doesn't even know how to take a hint FFS.

I finally found my passion at 21 which I feel is not too late but according to his words, I don't know what to do with my life while he's the one who quits jobs after jobs and makes irrational decisions in other sectors of his life which has caused him irreparable losses. 

To add, I have a sponsor child and I recently adopted a pet, so my committments are packed. I also have twin 2 month old nieces for whom I usually do something nice everytime I get to see them. This dude only liked the idea of having a baby but never going through the difficulties of pregnancy or parenthood. He'd even stop caring after the baby grows and stops looking ""cute"". Yikes to the infinity. He said he'd like to have 11 kids with me with no regards to my body. He'd body shame me, for my belly and what not. So imagine if I decided to get pregnant with this dude.

He would also shift responsibilities and blame like an absolute manchild. Idk if it's a manipulation tactic but he'd apologize the moment I'd say that what he's doing is wrong, then immediately shift the blame on me, texting like a madman, that because of my action, that was his reaction. 

He'd call me all derogatory names and reduce me to an object of his entertainment and when I rightfully became upset or cried, my emotions didn't matter to him or I was overreacting, he was just kidding and he will never talk to me again if I behaved like that.

He also said that after our relationship, he got 4 proposals. I'm calling BS on that. Either it's an unsuccessful attempt to rope me in or he was already talking to these women while we were together. For info, this convo happened after two months of our breakup so 4 proposals immediately after our breakup? Fishy fishy. 

When I finally started losing grip on the trauma bond and stood up for myself, he broke up with me. Glad, the trash took itself out. Otherwise I would never have the courage to get out.

jv4muq,Performative femininity?,"What's a good view on it?

Personally, my hair is short. I style it and wear makeup when I go outside, but not so much when I'm inside. I'm not horribly concerned about being thin like I used to be. I don't really have the time or patience for ""girly"" things - because I'm an adult woman.

But I just discovered r/justlegbeardthings. Apparently, not performing femininity is a huge breach of social contract for men. 

What I have trouble dealing with is this: men who say they ""deserve"" beautiful women A. Very rarely offer much in terms of love or commitment, and B. Are the types who will cheat anyway. 

I've noticed a lot of them are anti-feminists. And yet, they aren't traditional. They demand hot, thin, and young, but they pump and dump, and they don't talk about how men should provide for their hot, thin, young wives who shouldn't be making more money than them, etc. 

Women, as a collective, simply will never stop fighting to afford basic human dignity, and we survive quite well on our own, when we have our own terms laid out, and can truly enforce our own boundaries. 

What I want to understand is, what about not performing femininity will actually hurt a woman in the long run, rather than even aid her in avoiding men who think the amount of hair on a woman's legs is more important than her qualities as a genuine counterpart?

I get that focusing on looks will earn a woman a man more than almost anything else about her, but unless you're in a social circle where the men simply don't divorce, respect women, and work hard, it's all such a waste, when not a superfluous and course-changing distraction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/jv4muq/performative_femininity/,1605522682.0,125,0.98,29,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

jv2me4,If you ever find yourself suppressing your need to make gifts...,"Some of you girls here love making gifts. It's a little adventure - to polish the idea, make it special, plan it, buy it, make sure they don't see it beforehand. But did you ever make a gift to someone and, even though they seemed grateful, something was missing? Or they weren't grateful at all? 

I'll tell you that, sisters: love language or not, a person who knows how to MAKE a good gift will appreciate it. The one who lacks empathy and intelligence will not. That guy who gave a weak ""thanks"" to the gift you planned for a week? That dude who gave you a candle vs your hand crafted figurine for your anniversary? They're not a good, respectful partners.

It breaks my heart to see women who make those absolutely fantastic plans about how to make their man happy, but then he gifts her this shitty book about a topic she's not even interested in and the spark in her eyes disappears. She doesn't know what is this feeling. She will make less and less gifts, and wither away without a way to express her need to manifest her energy into a physical form

Rape culture is real and everyone is in on it-- abusers, enablers, bystanders, and the media. Most romantic movies I have seen has an element of predatory or abusive behavior. They brainwashed and groomed me and other women so much. I was groomed to stop listening to my gut and discomfort around the behavior and was taught I was lucky, special and beautiful to be experiencing the abuse. This year has been a lot of work of unlearning this grooming and seeing how I was used and how making me feel special is all part of the grooming process. It doesn't mean I am not special or beautiful, it's just that it is not flattering to be preyed upon by predators who don't really love me--not in a healthy way. They saw me as an object to satisy their needs until they got bored/ discarded me and found someone else. My pedophilic dad did that to me. NEVER AGAIN.

juq8tc,What enforcing your boundaries actually looks like,"Enforcing your boundaries is not just telling someone what your boundaries are and thinking that will be enough - especially in the early stages of dating. It is natural for people to try and push for what they want ‚Äì and LVM will push extremely hard and opportunistically jump on any opening. Don't believe him when he invites you over ""just to cuddle"" - LVM rely on being able to wear you down. If you give an inch he will take a mile. **It is much better for someone to lose interest and ghost you because you won't come over, than for them to lose interest and ghost you after slowly pushing you into having sex with them.**

Enforcing your boundaries means saying no clearly. It means not over-explaining or apologising. It means having a strict number of chances you give someone, and if they use that up, you cut them off - even if it's hard and you're attached. It means cutting people off fully, and not leaving a little window open hoping they'll still reach out. It means blocking, not just deleting. It means having the same boundaries for everyone, and not making exceptions because someone is particularly cute or you have history. It means holding yourself accountable - if you know you have a high sex drive but don't want to sleep with someone too soon, do not put yourself in a situation where sex might happen until you're ready.

If he is overstepping - speak out. If it now feels uncomfortable because you said something, let it feel uncomfortable. Don't let him gaslight you into thinking you 'overreacted' to his 'joke' - you both know what happened. There was no joke. He is the one who overstepped your boundaries, he is the one who made it awkward. If you hurt someone's feelings by saying no to them - too bad. Do not apologise because you have nothing to apologise for. 

It's hard, but remember you only stand to gain by enforcing your boundaries and you only stand to lose by compromising them. A person worthy of your time will respect your boundaries and will not need to be told twice. If a man reacts badly to you saying no, he never had genuine feelings or good intentions for you in the first place. If he ghosts, he was going to ghost anyway. If he cannot respect your boundaries, he never will.

* Given time, the views of those around you become your views.

* Humiliation in any degree is never a singular event. 

* How you respond sets the bar for going forward. 
* Expect misogynistic ""humor"" everywhere, ***but especially in small groups.***
 
* If you decide prior how you'll react, you're not caught off-guard.

jumgbe,"Best relationship tips, big and small: let's share!","I was thinking back on some of the things that I've learned about good relationships and I thought a post where we all share would be a great resource for if and when we find our HVM. 

All of this information is for committed, vetted relationships with a HVM, so please don't go off in the wrong direction. 

I thought this thread would be particularly useful for people whose parents did not model a healthy relationship for them and/or people who have not been in the healthy relationship themselves.

I was reading a thread about gift giving here and I remembered the tip that I heard from a woman here months ago. When she starts seriously dating a man she also starts a list on her phone where she keeps track of everything that he says that he likes or wants, his interests, his favorite color, everything. That way when it comes time to give a gift she has a whole list of information and ideas. 

Now I don't think I've ever been a particularly good gift giver and I would panic when birthdays and holidays came around. You don't want to give somebody important to you a gift that makes it look like they aren't. Keeping a list solves this problem. It's just a small thing that did not occur to me and was certainly not modeled in my family. 

Another good tip for a relationship I learned is that if you worry about your partner and your partner worries about you then everybody gets taken care of. This does not mean don't take care of yourself. It means that you think of them and do things for them and they should be thinking of you and doing things for you.

This person also taught me that you should both give a little bit more than you think the other person is giving and that way you're both always giving plenty to each other and the relationship. A good partner, when you give more, they will give more. And that way the relationship grows and strengthens. (Don't give it they aren't giving too. This is only for a high value relationship with a high value partner. This is also not for compromising your boundaries or your body.)

The same man also taught me how to communicate like an adult. My family was all about screaming in your face if you said anything they didn't like. So I just shut up a long time ago and gave up trying. I thought I was the problem in this equation until I met him. He showed me I was perfectly capable of sitting down and having an open conversation, communicating needs, and then he would fulfill them or we would talk further. There was no blow up. No purposeful misunderstanding, no gas lighting. I didn't even know people could actually talk like that. I had never seen it. This is how we should be able to communicate with our partners.

is3q2g,"Why ""walk dates"" are a thing on OLD and why they should be trashed every single time.","Men are like chameleons; they adapt and learn ""what works"" to get what they want from women, and it spreads in the OLD community.

**Walk Dates should be completely ignored, like a plague!**

**Why Walk Dates work for men -**

1. There is still a segment of women who think ""walks"" are romantic, different, and charming. This creates a prime situation for men to manipulate. Men have learned this, and use it to their advantage.
2. He gets to **SET THE TONE** of the entire relationship (low effort, no money spent, low standards). It is about **CONTROL**.
3. Women can be broken down (they drop their guard) while on a walk and being talked to. Men have *learned this*.
4. Walks cost no money for him.
5. Walks allow casual dress (for him). He can damn near roll out of bed.
6. He takes ZERO risks in any way. He can just walk away (lol) if you're not hot enough.
7. He risks no social shame. In a restaurant, bar, coffee shop... there is some social risk for him. Walking is alone.

**\*\*Men are using COVID-19 as leverage to get Walk Dates.** *DON'T FALL FOR IT.*

Restaurants, coffee shops, and bars have been open for months with different protocols. In my state, they're almost as busy as they were, pre-COVID. We wear masks until seated or eat on the patios or get to-go.

**NEVER. EVER accept a Walk Date.**

You will be treated like a dog. These men need to be moved out of the gene pool for even suggesting such a concept.

**Men KNOW their intentions.** Men are either actively looking for their wife, or they aren't.

If you're with a man in the 2nd group, the problem is, they usually won't be direct and tell you this outright because they know this has negative consequences for them. They will wait for you to bring it up and string you along, sometimes for years. Sometimes they'll even marry you.

irxfk9,Why attachment styles theory can save you a lot of heartache,"Hello, my fellow queens! This is a post I have been meaning to make for a time as I haven't seen attachment styles brought forth a lot around here. We all want to vet men and pick the one who will add maximum value and benefit to our lives. Since I am an avid reader of psychology books, I thought to share a little tip with all the lovely queens on this sub: knowing about attachment styles will help your vetting process. Tremendously.

My therapist recommended that I read ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller. At first, it seemed weird to me, but, then this book was a real eye - opener. Why? Because it helped me asses my own attachment style, alongside my significant other's attachment style so that I can determine how compatible we are on a level that's different and deeper to me than, say, liking the same kind of music. Sure, being a metal head myself with a metal head SO is great, but knowing our attachment styles (Secure and Secure) fit? It gave me extra confidence.

Psychology can be your friend, sisters. It can help you predict someone else's behavior. It can save you weeks, months, years of heartbreak. It can be a very resourceful tool for you. It can be your friend in your vetting process by offering you a more specific frame to work with while you're out there living your queen life.

Dating is already tricky and risky as it is for women. Romance can be enjoyed and it can be wonderful, but only if we manage to keep our cool and pay close attention. By no means I am the Supreme authority in how each and every one of yours vetting goes or should go. I only wanted to offer all of you better tools in the future so that you can add more tools to your dating strategy toolkit. Play it safe and, most importantly, play it smart out there, sisters! üå∫‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/irxfk9/why_attachment_styles_theory_can_save_you_a_lot/,1600000333.0,148,0.95,17,FemaleDatingStrategy,nenindis

irrjqe,"Dependent girls are the female version of nice guys, I realized (as a concept)","You know how guys complain that women say they want nice guys but then go for the assholes (aka guys with a backbone and some pride)? 

Well I perused red pill blogs once upon a time ago and these bloggers would constantly deride independent women that don't need a man and gushing over ""dependent"" women who want to please their men and be homemakers.

BUT THEY SAY THIS IN IGNORANCE just like women say they want nice guys.

Men SAY they want a nice submissive girl but if you look at examples they will only respect and truly love a girl that is NOT a doormat. I saw this play out in real life, of course, but also:

Taylor doesn't bring anything to the table in the relationship besides being a mom and homemaker (and chased HIM when they first got together) and her husband disrespects her. Adrienne, on the other hand, has her own way to make $$ and doesn't  think much of Paul lol and he tries hard to make her happy on their anniversary. And so I was reminded of this and thought I'd share.

TL:DR don't listen to men that say a woman's accomplishments mean nothing and that they want her submissive and dependent on them. LIES. They want a woman who owns herself. just like we want that in a man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/irrjqe/dependent_girls_are_the_female_version_of_nice/,1599970508.0,91,0.91,13,FemaleDatingStrategy,Ugly_Swan
irr7bf,"I recognized a rebound and love bombing situation, stood up for myself and ended it!","We met through mutual friends and have known each other for a year and a half. There was always a mutual attraction but he has had a girlfriend, up until mid-July, and I've respected their relationship. 

We finally got the chance to try a relationship three weeks ago. The first week went great and it was exciting. He took me on dates and paid for everything, he was generous and paid genuine attention to me. We clicked. He had a lot of HV qualities.

Then the second week I needed more space and alone time and that really set him off. He got very insecure, kept checking in on if I wanted to continue the relationship, and assured me his feelings, for the girlfriend he just broke up with, were over. Then one of the nights we hung out that week, he TOLD ME HE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME. *Record scratch*

My reply was ""oh wow yeah thats a lot"". I should've left and ended it right there, but it took another week and a half for me to really end it. During that other week and a half he told me he loved me again, kept asking if i wanted to date him, and was using me as an emotional crutch. I felt like he used me as a rebound to try to fill the void and replace his ex girlfriend. He told me he loved me to try to control the relationship and lock me down.

When I ended the relationship, he threw a tantrum. He drove me home erratically and speeding, cussed me out and then sent me a bunch of crazy, angsty texts. 

It was a quick, wild ride and a bullet dodged. 

So, although it was only 3 weeks, I learned a lot from this situationship, enforced my boundaries and put myself first.

It's been a month and a bit since I left my abusive relationship, so I thought I'd give you guys an update!

First off, I am safe. My child and I are staying with family. Thank you all for your concern! My ex is being charged with a couple different crimes against me. I also am in the process of getting a restraining order. I have a super reputable and nice lawyer and I've also been receiving help from the local women's shelter.

Mentally, I don't think I've ever felt better. I'm working with my doctor on a treatment plan for my anxiety (some stemming from the abuse, some I've dealt with my whole life). I'm finally in a position to not only save money, but to buy myself clothes that fit, that I've needed for awhile after acquiring the mom bod. I even quit smoking again, since with all the stress I picked it up again near immediately after giving birth. Nobody is stealing from me anymore and it's such a relief. I'm making my own decisions and it feels great.

I just wanted to give you lovely women an update since a couple of you asked for one and I wanted you all to know that I've got my happy ending to all this madness. I hope if we have any members or lurkers who find themselves in a similar situation, they can read my words and know that it gets better after letting go.

irmhty,FDS is anti polyamory,"FDS is not the place for you to discuss your polyamory or push polyamory. We are anti polyamory. I've seen some people pushing it in the comments. It's unacceptable and it's not a discussion for this subreddit.

Polyamory is a ridiculous concept that ruins relationships. It's mostly for people who aren't happy in their relationships but don't have the guts to end them, or men who want to sleep around. It is an absolute joke how people involved in polyamory talk about how they ""love"" multiple people. They're just having flings with other people they barely know for six months at a time or less. That's a sad representation of their supposed to ""love"".

Polyamory is a trap for women. It is not to our benefit to share a man with multiple other women. It divides his time and attention among multiple women, reducing attention and resources invested in you. It increases chances of STDs, even with condom use, and women are far more susceptible to infection.

Most men can't even sexually satisfy one woman so I don't know why they think they deserve more than one to disappoint. Furthermore if your partner can only manage having sex three times a week but he's now sharing it with two other women, that means you get sex once a week in your supposedly primary relationship. Scam.

It's just cheating, but right in the woman's face. It's an insult. You are not more mature for going along with it, in fact it shows how weak you are. Women need to know what they want, demand it, and if they don't get it, leave. That is maturity.

Edit: thank you for the awards

Second edit: the folks over at r polyamory are so pressed they've made three posts whining about this post! If you take a walk over there you can see some of the fine male specimens with multiple women hanging off of them that you too could share with multiple other women if you want to be polyamorous üôÉüòÇüí©ü§°ü§Æ

irggx6,Men‚Äôs favorite body type: Insecure,"Never, ever, EVER listen to what a man has to say about your body, because it‚Äôs not entirely about what‚Äôs physical.

A couple years after graduating high school I gained pounds to the right places. When I started my first full time job I got involved with a bonefied asshole. He was trying to make moves and I was very flattered with the attention. Then he gets into negging, one of those sarcastic douche bag types. He‚Äôd talk about how my chest was flat and neg me about my hair.

Over time, since the job is physical, I lost a lot of fat (30 lbs). Once that happened the attacks got worse, he‚Äôd compare me to the thick girl that worked there to piss me off. 

Come to find out a couple months after I ditched his ass that his baby mama was skinnier than I ever was. And notably another time a coworkers daughter came in once and I just missed her, when he said she was in there his description was that she had a ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùbig heart‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù. I saw her eventually and she was smaller than me.. he literally said that just to get a reaction.

So we‚Äôve been getting some feedback that the tone of the sub has changed significantly with the large influx of new users we‚Äôve had lately. 

Most of the newbies come looking for specific relationship advice, which we would definitely like to help with as we think a lot of the main relationship subs are dominated by men and as such give women *the worst* advice (CoMmUniCaTe üôÑ) 

We were hoping that as the sub matured there would be more established FDS members than newbies here to influence the comments, but it seems our growth trajectory isn‚Äôt slowing down anytime soon so we might be dominated by newbies for awhile. 

To keep the spirit of the main FDS sub alive, we‚Äôre going to redirect all specific relationship advice questions to r/AskFDS. 

This will free up some space on the main sub for the established members who want to focus on strategy content and minimize the amount of frivolous, clearly-haven‚Äôt-read-the-handbook comments and questions. 

We will still request that newbies read the Handbook **first** before asking your relationship question on r/AskFDS because so many of the questions we get asked are already addressed there and it‚Äôs great base knowledge to understand our specific lense. 

And as always, please consider joining the FDS website www.therealfemaledatingstrategy.com where we have more privacy for personal questions.

hx31ox,"The ""Next Files"": Encounters of the Single Kind. Chapter 1 (The Tale of the Guy Who didn't take No for an Answer).","One Saturday night long ago, I met up with some of my girlfriends for drinks at a local bar. We had a good chance to catch up with one another, and we were able to bond undisturbed throughout our gathering. Around 10:30pm, my friends decided to call it a night. I had a drink to finish, so I decided to stay behind at the bar for a bit. Within 5 minutes of their departure, a guy approached and sat at the barstool next to me. I did not pay him any attention and remained focused on my drink. Roughly 2 minutes passed before he started talking to me.

He introduced himself and asked me what I was drinking. I had been around the rodeo enough to know that this was his opening line, and I didn't want things to drag on for longer than they needed to be. I told him what I was drinking and that I was leaving once I had finished the drink. He proceeded down what I presume to be his normal ""pickup banter"". He said he had seen me with my friends all night, and he only now had the opportunity to approach me. He said that he found me cute, and that he would like to have my phone number.

My only interest at that time was to finish my drink and leave, so I politely declined his request. I took that moment to gulp down my remaining beverage and stood up to begin my exit. At this point, the man decided asking for my phone number again would be the right call. I declined him again. He asked for a third time, to which I again declined and started walking towards the bar's exit. 

Much to my surprise, the lovely gentleman decided to follow me through the bar and grab my arm to stop me from leaving. He asked me one final time for my number, and wanted to know why I wouldn't give it to him. It is at this point that all desire to remain cordial on my end had evaporated from my being. I removed his hand from my arm, told him no a final time, and  proceeded to address the entirety of the patrons of the bar for an announcement. I asked if any lovely patron would be so kind as to give this man a phone number, since I would not be giving him mine. The bar erupted into laughter, the man stood there dumbfounded, and I continued to walk out of the bar.

I thought I was in the clear until the man barged out of the exit door 10 seconds behind me, and followed me to my car. He was irate at this point and had cornered me between himself and the driver side door of my car. He was so in a fit of rage that he had also failed to notice the 5-10 guys who had followed him out of the bar in order to watch a spectacle that was likely afoot. Much to my surprise, the men that came outside to watch the drama unfold actually stepped in, grabbed the man from behind, and drug him away from me and back into the bar. 

To whoever the gentlemen were that swooped in and carried the rowdy gent away, you have my sincerest thanks.

hwou8o,"Never let a LVM know that you are angry with him. Men simply don't fear female anger in the same way that women fear male anger. In fact, men seem to actively enjoy it.","I've learned the hard way, over and over, that men simply don't fear female anger the same way we fear male anger.

Men like to joke about ""crazy women"" and it's considered funny because they know that an angry woman is ultimately harmless. Whereas a ""crazy man"" having a fit of rage might kill all of his children, then his wife, and then himself.

Male anger is fucking scary and potentially life threatening. 

In contrast, men are largely indifferent to female anger. It's why you hear stories like ""my wife left me because I didn't do the dishes! I was totally blindsided!"" Chances are, she had been asking him to contribute to the household chores for months or even *years* and he didn't notice or care. Her anger literally just did not register in his mind.

Worse still, some men think that female anger is amusing, and will deliberately push your buttons just to get a rise out of you and will then laugh in your face. This is why men love trolling feminist spaces, it's merely entertainment to them.

This is why at FDS we say ""block and delete"". Sending him lengthy messages describing in excruciating detail why he's an asshole and how he hurt you will achieve nothing. Even short witty insults have the same effect.

He either doesn't care at all, or he actively enjoys it. Don't give him pleasure of knowing that he provoked a reaction out of you. It makes him feel powerful and in control. Deny him the satisfaction and don't respond. Just block and delete. 

I know, I know. You're hurt, you're angry, and you want to teach him a lesson or hurt him just like he hurt you. I get it.

What I'm ***not*** saying is ""don't ever feel anger"". It's normal to feel angry when someone treats you unfairly. Those feelings are completely justified. All I'm saying is don't *show* or *communicate* that you are angry because if you do, he wins and you lose.

If you *absolutely must* have some form of revenge, remember this quote:

*Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.*

If you really want to hit a man where it hurts, laugh at him. I do it all the time with male family members and male coworkers and it works like a charm. Humor just totally disarms men and puts them in their place. This works especially well in a group context where other people can pile on and laugh at him too.

A good example of this is the scene in Pride &amp; Prejudice when Darcy insults Lizzie, and instead of getting angry and confronting him, she walks over to her friend and repeats what he just said and they both have a good laugh at his expense.

Of course, only do this if you are completely safe from retaliation. Men will sometimes respond to ego injuries like a wounded animal, they just lash out with pure unhinged rage.

TL;DR: Don't show a man that you are angry. The best response is no response at all. If you absolutely *must* respond, simply laugh at him. No wordy messages, just laughter. Female ridicule is a man's worst nightmare.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hwou8o/never_let_a_lvm_know_that_you_are_angry_with_him/,1595540857.0,878,0.96,106,FemaleDatingStrategy,myousername

Idk if any other FDSers can relate but when I am in a long term relationship my parents can get overly optimistic and excited about our potential future. Even if the relationship seems ""perfect"" at the time, my family is willing to make him a part of our family, call him their future son-in-law and be given presents, money and support. It's part of their cultural value system because the only reason you would be in a long term relationship is because you are serious about a future and want to get married eventually.

Due to my previous low self-esteem, I was desperate to have a boyfriend. I was willing to make excuses and change my values to match his because in my mind who else would want to be with me? Well, turns out by not asking myself what I want in a relationship I was dating men who considered me a ""fun"" person to be around, but didn't see a future with me (even if we were together for years). With each ending of a relationship, my family was devastated because of how much time and energy they invested into us.

Today I discussed with my parents that the next time I am dating someone, I am going to be a lot more strict on when to introduce him to them.

hvq7sa,A Big Sister Guide.,"I'm going to tell you about my breakup, and how I realised that men can go to literally ANY extent to get what they want from you until they get bored; and then I'm gonna tell you exactly what to do and what not to do after this shit happens. 

So my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me last year because he said he was depressed and suicidal and had to ""work on himself"" or whatever. Meanwhile we kept having sex and I kept wondering why everything seemed odd. My gut feeling kept telling me, but I was in a really horrible place at the time and didn't have the self worth to just fucking leave him. He kept using depression as a tactic to keep me around, since he knew that I was extremely sensitive to mental health issues. After a period of time he started acting depressed, and then he shut me off. Mind you, I almost left my family for this guy. I kept giving and giving, both material, physical, mental and emotional things for him because I legitimately loved him, and kept thinking that if I stayed around long enough, he would change. Not for me, but for himself. But the only thing that was stagnant was the sex. Then after the breakup he told me that he will never ever date again, I was his last. For one whole year I tried to figure out what the hell was going on, if there's something wrong with me, or if he's a piece of shit, and I kept bouncing back and forth between these thoughts. Until one year later, ie 3 days ago I found out about him- he got a new girlfriend, or is in the process of it. She had commented something sexual under his picture, and it was so clear that they had sexted before. After asking around a few friends, they finally told me the truth that he's been talking to the girl since 2.5 months. They also told me that he used me only for sex, and then fucking got bored. Lied to me about his mental health issues and therapy, and lied to his friends about what exactly happened during the breakup. So you tell me, a dude that pretends to be SO in love that he takes care of me in the beginning, acts like a husband, does everything in his power to protect me and care for me (all of this while having sex obviously), and then lies and treats me like shit to get out of the relationship, plays the victim card, tells me that he felt used after having sex with me, and then ends up finding a girl over the internet that he's talking sexual with and not even 3 full months are gone, what the fuck does this say? I don't think he's even told her about my side, which means he's building another relationship completely on lies. In fact he doesn't even know what happened on my side, the panic attacks and nightmares I've experienced. Anyway, I've lost all respect for him and I have learned some MAJOR stuff to get my self respect back. I'm going to put it down here for everyone. I'm not a professional in this, but this is what's working for me and hopefully, it will work for you too. 

Number 1: Do not fucking open tinder. 
I repeat, DO NOT open tinder. Or any of those dating apps. Some friends give the worst advice at this point and ask you to get into a rebound, but don't do it. It's the shortcut method which is bound to fail. You're going to get caught in another cycle of a situationship when you're already emotionally wrecked. And trust me, 90% of the guys on tinder ONLY want sex, and nothing more. You have to stay away from that cesspool and only concentrate on yourself at this point, because you were not a cheap product of the universe. You hold a lot of value which isn't supposed to be squandered like that. Luckily I got banned from tinder for some reason, and I just stopped using it. It kept pulling me into that wild circle of trying to date guys who only were in it for the sex. Get away from that shit.

Number 2: Always trust your gut feeling.
For the ones who have trouble differentiating between an insecurity and a gut feeling- an insecurity mainly makes you question your own character, or a trait, or a body part, basically it makes you question you, whereas a gut feeling makes you question the other person. I'm not asking you to be extremely critical either, your gut feeling will come from your body, it will make you repel from the situation in your mind. Do not ignore that gut feeling. Sometimes in the flow of the moment, things can get really exciting and you might wanna shrug that feeling off, but don't. ALWAYS pay attention to it, because going against it will definitely make you hurt. I had a horrible gut feeling about my ex, but I kept going anyway because I had no self worth.  

Number 3: Know your value and then add tax.
Just know that you are not expensive, but they can't afford you. There's a reason why Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Dior, etc. have such a high value. It's not for everyone. That quality is luxury and you have to be that quality. In fact, you are that quality. You need to realise it and work on it. There are people who could walk in your Prada store, look around and say ""I'm just looking around"" but deep inside they know that they cannot afford anything that's in there. Do not sell your product to such people. Let them walk out. The ones who can afford you, be it love or friendship, will afford you. The others can stay as ""window shoppers"". The ones who say that ""I'm not good enough for you"". They're right, they're not good enough. Now you walk away. My ex used to say that to me all the time and then be depressed, and my gut told me that it's a huge red flag, and it was. Wish I had walked away.

Number 4: Do something.
Anything. Invest your time in building yourself, bit by bit. Start doing things that help you keep busy. No matter how hard that sounds and no matter how broken you feel, only progress in a certain aspect is going to help you heal bit by bit, and there's no shortcut around it. You have to feel good about yourself, and that feeling comes by when you achieve something. The smallest of progress is going to change things for you. And what we call as ""hobbies"" at this point become life savers. Follow them and rip them to shreds, do something you love. Or find something you love. Remember that you will only attract guys that don't work on themselves to nurture their soul, if you don't find that trait worthy. Find worth in the doing the simplest things, and make that a part of your standards. 

Number 5: Keep talking about it. 
Everyone's got a way of coping with this, but you've to find friends that are ready to listen at most of the times. Who will give you their honest opinion to help you out of it. There will be friends who will make you feel like shit instead of doing any better, and I recommend you stay away from them. Talk to these problems to the friends that will legitimately understand your situation and help you out of it. Friends like that can be life savers and they will help you vent out the terrible feelings whole giving you rational advice every now and then. How to differentiate between a good friend and a bad friend? Your gut feeling will tell you. A bad friend will definitely won't take your problems that seriously, or stick around only when they want to have fun. A good friend however will stick with you through thick and thin, and especially during the dark times. The others will look sweet but give you cavities.

I have a lot more to say, if you like this so far and want to know more, or if this helped you even a little bit, I can make a part 2 of it with more information. 
As a final bit of advice, I want you to know that it's not your fault. The guy that did you wrong, it's on him. If there's anything such as karma, it will get them. If not, that's not our problem anymore. You only and only look out for yourself now. Find out who you are, set a standard for yourself and do not look back. Let it go, you're so much better without that garbage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hvq7sa/a_big_sister_guide/,1595407394.0,199,0.98,18,FemaleDatingStrategy,whomstsummonedme

hvdsyq,[WARNING: LONG] [30sF] unburdening myself and sharing so no one makes my stupid mistakes ever again,"Hi all, posting from an alt as my ex knows my main account and I don‚Äôt want him to have the satisfaction of knowing I give 2 shits about him anymore- because once I hit submit on this, I‚Äôm done thinking about him. After this I plan to peace out of here for a while to work on myself instead of dating. Strap in if you plan to read the whole thing, it‚Äôs long. You can skip to the tl;dr for my lessons learned.

In my late 20s/early 30s I was the archetypal ""strong independent woman"". I was chased, I did not chase. I was successful at work (still am). I was confident, I had hobbies and good friends and honestly a pretty great life.

Then I took a new job in a new city, because it paid more and got me closer to my family (what I felt was the only missing piece in my life). My new job had me traveling a LOT (&gt;80%) and I suddenly didn‚Äôt have many friends, or much of a social life, and it goes without saying my dating life was shite with all the travel. I dated a coworker, it went poorly, then I resigned myself to singledom and few friends because of my (very well paying!) job.

Then one day, a rare Friday I was actually in town, my roommate set me up on a blind date with a friend of a friend. It had been ages since I got laid so I figured why not. He wasn‚Äôt super attractive, fit but short with thinning hair, and didn‚Äôt have a great job (personal trainer). But I took him home and it turned out he was GREAT in bed. Months later we met up again when I happened to be in town, and suddenly we started texting a lot more and spending all my weekends at home together. He was fun to be around, was happy to introduce me to his friends and family, and again *great* in bed. He made time for me. At the time this was all I was asking for. Pretty bottom of the barrel standards, eh? The sort of thing ANY guy should be able to do if you‚Äôre dating him. We got close super fast and we exchanged ‚ÄúI love yous‚Äù only a month or two after we started hanging out seriously.

During this time, mid-2019 as we‚Äôre early into dating, I start finding out some serious shit about him as he slowly lets it trickle out. He still lived with his parents ‚Äì why? Because he OD‚Äôd a few years back and was found brain dead in his home by his ex, who stayed with him long enough for him to leave the hospital and more or less get physically back to normal before she peaced out. She left because he was still seriously depressed (the reason he OD‚Äôd in the first place) and just had a shitty outlook on life. His depression took over his life to the point where he had to quit his job and move back home. He was still struggling with that depression when I met him in early 2019, but he managed to mask it long enough to hook me in, and he flatly refused to get therapy for it (therapy doesn‚Äôt work honey, it‚Äôs just bunk!). He still struggled with addiction issues, to the point of stealing my Adderall which I relied on at the time to keep up with my demanding job, then when I threatened to break up he cried and moaned until I took him back and it took me FOREVER to force him to replace the Adderall he‚Äôd stolen. He didn‚Äôt work on this addiction issue, instead he expected me to buy a lockbox for my meds because he couldn‚Äôt control himself. Then he figured out how to sneak into that lockbox, when I caught him again, it was now MY fault that I didn‚Äôt secure the meds well enough. He finally got a real job, very low paying due to his poor employment history, but still didn‚Äôt move out of his parents house because he was desperately broke and needed to save his money. Yet I watched him spend money on weed (TONS of money on weed), spend money ordering out food (but it‚Äôs for you, too, honey!), spend money on over-expensive gym memberships he really didn‚Äôt need when there were far more affordable options. Through this I was also spending tons of money ‚Äì on him. I bought him a brand new iPhone for his birthday. For Christmas I got him the latest Airpods (I myself was still using the last generation ones). I supplied the majority of the weed ‚Äì he never had to pay for anything, if he felt like it he would buy some on his own to share. I even paid entirely for a post-Christmas beach vacation in Laguna Beach, I booked at room at the Ritz, paid for room service, paid for weed to get delivered to our room; he spent the whole thing sleeping in our hotel room and I think we maybe had sex once or twice. You‚Äôd think I would‚Äôve seen the obvious but nope.

During this time, I was still traveling the majority of the week, when I came home we‚Äôd spend 100% of our time together. He was a pretty supportive during these times ‚Äì he would pick me up from the airport, he would cook for me and would help clean up if I cooked, he would help around the house. He would make a point to work with me to plan fun things for us to do together. He bought me flowers a couple times. The sex was frequent (well, frequent enough ‚Äì once or twice on the weekends, but hey we hardly saw each other). He would pay attention to me. I felt like I mattered in his life. FWIW this one paragraph basically sums up why I stayed with him, in case you are wondering. This really was all I was asking for. I was completely ok with being the main provider, I just wanted to be with someone who made me feel like *I mattered to him.* Pretty low standards, eh? This went on for the entire second half of 2019.

So we‚Äôre 6 months in or so and we‚Äôre talking marriage. Fast forward a month and he‚Äôs telling my parents he‚Äôs going to ask me. Fast forward a month or two, it‚Äôs early 2020, and he‚Äôs proposing, with a small ring (it‚Äôs all he can afford) while sitting on a park bench outside my sister‚Äôs house, in a proposal that was so poorly planned and executed it was embarrassing to tell others the story. What happened to a romantic surprise on top of a mountain? What happened to a long romantic speech that would sweep me off my feet? It took us less than 5 minutes and was so anti-climactic and such a disappointment compared to my dreams that when we went to bed that night, I snuck out of bed to go to the bathroom for a quiet cry.

Why did I put up with all this, you ask? The dialogue in the back of my head went like this:

-	You‚Äôre in your 30s! No one wants a woman that old. Especially since you don‚Äôt want kids. Finding someone who wants you will be like finding a needle in a haystack.

-	No one is perfect. You can‚Äôt expect perfection, especially at your age. At your age you‚Äôll be getting leftovers and semi-broken people.

-	You‚Äôre not perfect yourself. Never mind that you‚Äôre working on yourself, you can‚Äôt expect perfection from someone else if you can‚Äôt deliver it yourself.

-	You work too much to date anyway. It would take way too much work to replace this guy. Be happy you at least found something.

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. I wanted to move to another city, and his work supported him transferring to a city we both wanted to move to. We got there at the end of Feb 2020, then ‚Äì coronavirus hit. Quarantine came down 2 weeks after we moved there and suddenly we were stuck with each other 24/7.

Up til this point he‚Äôd been living with his parents for several years and was quite used to having his every need provided for ‚Äì he was a true momma‚Äôs boy. He hadn‚Äôt had to take care of himself or really do chores beyond occasionally doing his own laundry when he REALLY needed to. On top of that his job started to place more pressure on him, and since up til that point he‚Äôd had zero success in a professional role in his entire life, he tied his entire sense of self-esteem to success at that job and made success there a top priority in his life ‚Äì above all else, including me. For reference, I was making 4x as much as him in take home pay. I was the primary provider, and he told me that rankled him. I was paying the majority of rent (~70%), buying most of the groceries, paying all the bills. I bought most of the weed we smoked, though at this point I started to realize he was bleeding me dry and started to designate ‚Äúmy‚Äù weed (bought by me) from ‚Äúhis‚Äù weed (bought by him). This made him pissy and upset, because we‚Äôre engaged and what‚Äôs mine should be his too! Yet he had zero interest in budgeting, or trying to cut back, to save MY money. Instead he wanted to become as successful as me, so he could take care of me ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt really that ok with me being the provider.

But my job slowed down during quarantine ‚Äì although I was still making the same pay, I had to work ¬æ of the day instead of the full day. He just assumed that with this free time, I should be able to also take care of everything around the house too. He rarely did his share of the chores, and wouldn‚Äôt bother to clean up after himself. He was working typically 10-12 hours a day, sometimes more, which I completely understand is tough because I‚Äôve been there too ‚Äì but I never lapsed the way he would. Yet when I would ask him to clean up after himself, at a minimum, it would turn into a fight because he claimed he just couldn‚Äôt do it. I was expected to live in his filth, or clean it up if I didn‚Äôt like it. He wanted to adopt a puppy, so we did, but again the little guy became entirely my responsibility. Another example ‚Äì I would often go out to do errands and pick up groceries, on my own (pandemic, I had free time, w/e). I would come home with armfuls of groceries. I would have to explicitly ASK him for help to bring in and put away the groceries. Even when I asked him, he would put away a couple things, then wander off because he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù he was still supposed to be helping me, even though I am clearly still working and the table is still clearly full of groceries. I mean just dumb shit.

The cherry on top is that between the stress of his work, and the stress I was apparently adding to his life because I was ‚Äúnagging‚Äù him to clean up his own shit, we stopped having sex. But hey, it had been months (since about a month before we got engaged actually) since he‚Äôd bothered to put effort into sex at all. Foreplay, if it happened, was 30 seconds or less. He was reluctant to use lube too. Sex itself was maybe a minute, 2 tops, of him pumping until he was done. He didn‚Äôt touch my clit, in spite of EVERY time we had sex I would make a point to physically grab his hand, put it on my clit, and tell him to touch me, while I was blowing him or touching him to excite him so we could have sex. I even told him, on several occasions, that I needed more foreplay. Guess how often he initiated foreplay even after I told him multiple times I liked it and was being about as bluntly direct as I could be that I *fucking wanted foreplay*? HAHAHA I don‚Äôt think I need to tell you.

We (I) kept trying though. We fought almost daily. He stopped touching me. He never cuddled me, rarely hugged or kissed me, and buried himself in his work. He‚Äôd spend the first 2 hours of his day in bed on his phone, then go to the office for 8-10 hours (even though his work would have let him stay home during the pandemic - but no he ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to get out of the house), then when he came home he wanted to be left alone to ‚Äúdecompress‚Äù for another 2 hours while he sat on his phone again (I was expected to walk the pup, prep food, and just wait around for him to be available during this). If I was lucky after all this, he‚Äôd spend 30 minutes to an hour eating food and telling me about his work. He never asked about my work. He never asked about my day. I would try to tell him details, but he‚Äôd be back on his phone while I talked, and when I would bring updates to stories I‚Äôd previously told him, it was clear he didn‚Äôt remember what I‚Äôd told him in the first place. Yet I was his professional counselor, I gave him so many tips on how to succeed at work (remember he was someone who‚Äôd never been professionally successful and I had a stellar and successful career). I was still doing the majority of the chores around the house. I was pouring myself into this relationship and he couldn‚Äôt be arsed to talk to me, or do dishes, or fuck, even TOUCH me.

Was I bitter and angry with him? Yes. He made me feel guilty constantly for my frustration. It would go like this ‚Äì he did a shitty thing. I got upset and frustrated. He got angry with me for being upset. I would apologize. He would haughtily accept my apology‚Ä¶and never recognize my very valid frustration, would never change, would never acknowledge his contribution to the situation. It took me a long time to realize that fucking Mother Theresa would‚Äôve gotten frustrated with his dumb ass. My reaction was completely understandable.

Through all this, I was sinking into depression. I‚Äôd lost 20 lbs and I was already skinny before all this started, I was barely able to sleep 5 hours a night, and my body literally started falling apart. After a scary brush with my health, I realized that I was slowly killing myself by staying in the relationship. At this point I had begged him over and over to get therapy for himself. At a minimum I wanted couples counseling. When I‚Äôd tell him this, he would shrug and say he didn‚Äôt have the time/money for therapy for himself (plus he thought it ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt work‚Äù), but that, ok fine, sure why not, we could do couples therapy. I realized he was expecting me, once again, to do all the work ‚Äì find the therapist, schedule the appt, pay for it. I realized this was going to be my life, forever. I was forever going to do the work in this relationship. It would be more than a full time job and if I was lucky I might get occasionally tepid sex with no foreplay and maybe a half-attentive listener a few times a week. I realized I could literally pay someone to do this role and it would cost me less than supporting his worthless ass.

I realized if I did not get him out of my life, the stress would literally kill me.

What finally broke me was when we had to re-sign our short-term lease from when we‚Äôd first moved. I realized that I was tying myself to another year of potentially living with this guy. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I told him it was over. I broke up with him and told him I wouldn‚Äôt be signing a new lease, and that he needed to find another place to live within the next month or so (when our lease ended).

It doesn‚Äôt end there sadly. Instead I went full simp: At this time thanks to my health issues, I badly needed help with some things around the house that I simply physically could not do. I offered to pay him for this help. I did need the help but I also pitied him ‚Äì he was going to struggle with money and I knew he needed some kind of help there. He agreed, then when we ended up fighting between the time I paid him and the time he was to do the work, he took my money and didn‚Äôt help me. I dunno what to even say here except ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

At this point he is blocked everywhere I can think of. I hope to god I never see him again. My health is getting better. I‚Äôm finally eating and sleeping again. I‚Äôm searching for a therapist and ‚Äúauditioning‚Äù to find one that can replace the amazing therapist I had in my old city. My pup is my life and has been my strongest supporter, he is awesome and is literally the only positive thing I can say my ex brought to my life. If not for that pup, I would say the last year of my life was not just wasted but actively damaged by this human being.

**Tl;dr:** 

1.	It doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are, or what you look like, or how badly you want a relationship. I promise you a bad relationship is worse than no relationship at all. Even non-abusive relationships can result in unintentional harm to yourself. The pain and anxiety of trying to force a relationship that isn‚Äôt working, can be truly awful. Do you love yourself? Because you should. And if you love yourself, you wouldn‚Äôt put yourself through that. Do you have a sister or brother or friend who you love? If you saw them in your relationship, would you tell them to GTFO?

2.	You have to be crystal clear with yourself on your standards. But expecting your partner to be a generally good person and have their shit together is not a ‚Äústandard‚Äù for a relationship. It‚Äôs a hygiene item. It‚Äôs something anyone who is dating should be expected to do. It‚Äôs not a plus, it‚Äôs a base expectation. Always remember to differentiate what are ‚Äúhygiene‚Äù items, and what are items that would help you differentiate between who you want to date and why. Examples of hygiene items ‚Äì can he clean up after himself? Is he nice to other people? Is he nice to you? These aren‚Äôt PLUSES. These are the BASICS. A ‚Äúplus‚Äù is ‚ÄìIs he a good cook? Is he really fit? Does he have a good sense of humor (for you)? Yes these things are my ‚Äústandards‚Äù and I think they should be standards for everyone, but it is NOT a ‚Äústandard‚Äù to expect someone to do their own fucking dishes. That‚Äôs a hygiene item. It‚Äôs ok if he is working on some of the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù, some people may disagree here but it is not a dealbreaker to me if a guy is between jobs, or has a low-paying job (to me, I‚Äôd rather have a passionate artist than a soulless millionaire), or even if he lives with his parents. Is he actively trying to improve himself? Is he capable of asking for and getting help to improve himself? Is continuous self-improvement a priority for him? THOSE are important markers.

hvdlg4,Im so tired of seeing some pickme in the comments of engagement posts.,"We get it, you don't need anything. It's about the love and sentiment. 

If they really thought it was about love and sentiment instead of the price of the ring they wouldn't assume every woman with a pricy rock on her hand doesn't love her husband. 

If they really thought price didn't matter they wouldn't feel the need to comment on posts where a guy is spending a large amount of money. 

If it were really about love and sentiment it wouldn't matter what the price high or low. But for some reason they only come out to shame and critique and show how special and unique they are by not wanting anything.

hvd9fl,"No, I am NOT the crazy one.","So recently, I was dating a man whom I thought was really great (as we all initially think they were). He has a rather successful career, he's secured, we had plenty of open and honest conversation and both of us knew exactly where the other person stands. There was no confusion and he made it clear that he's putting in the time and effort for me. Great, right? But then this fool called me up drunk one night and started venting about this girl he used to date who ghosted him (this was probably at least 7 or 8 months ago), turns out he found out on Facebook and she just got married. He then went farther by saying he'd really like to be petty and talk to her now-husband to send him all the ""stuff"" that she sent him. Something inside me clicked and that whole act instantly repulsed me, so I stopped him and told him why that's unnecessary and damaging to her BRAND SPANKING NEW MARRIAGE. Why he shouldn't care because she clearly stopped months ago. He couldn't understand where I was coming from, so I let it go because I wasn't going to have an argument with a drunk person. The next day, I brought it up hoping we could discuss it as honestly and openly as we've discussed other things in the past. He freaked out and accused me of insulting him by throwing his venting to his face when I merely asked him if he had some unresolved issues with his ex that needed to be addressed. He went out of his way to make me feel like I was the insecure, crazy one for thinking he's not over her when he CLEARLY wasn't. 

I've been in enough toxic relationships in the past to know that behaviors like that only get worse, so I cut him loose. Maybe it was just one simple drunken venting, but his willingness to ruin a marriage so his past hurt can be justified was something I never expected from him and it shook me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hvd9fl/no_i_am_not_the_crazy_one/,1595357389.0,230,0.98,27,FemaleDatingStrategy,potaytotomahto

hv99u8,How to vet for sexual compatibility,"This was my response to someone else and I thought it would make a decent post.

I think this is where vetting comes in again.

The whole idea of waiting 3 months to have sex with someone is so he can prove himself to you. Part of that is showing what he has to offer sexually. We are definitely not telling anyone to go 0 to 60 with their sex life. You can vet for sexual performance and compatibility during that time. You can vet how he kisses, caresses, snuggles, holds you, rhythm and the quality, durability and consistency of his erections to a degree (kissing and grinding on each other), stamina (sports like swimming running soccer are great for sexual stamina), generosity and how he is with his hands with neck rubs/foot rubs. He should absolutely be enthusiastic to prove himself to you as a good mate. Through all of these things you can give preferences and bits of feedback and see how he handles that to vet for how considerate he is of what you want physically. 

Later, before sex but after commitment is established, you can try oral. You can see how good he is with his mouth, if he can make you orgasm, what he can do with his hands and how considerate he is. If you go down on him you can vet for any creepy porn behavior like shoving your head down or making gross comments. You can also see the quality and duration of his erections. If he continuously goes soft that's a very bad sign. Ditto for premature ejaculation. I would absolutely make a man make you orgasm before you ever have sex with him. Either from oral or manual. He needs to show he can get you off for you to be willing to have sex with him. This way to you can judge his sexual generosity and also his enthusiasm for making his partner orgasm. Absolutely do not settle for a man who isn't super enthusiastic and turned on! He should I have an erection from going down on you. Also test him by having him finish you but don't give him anything. See how he handles it to vet for pushy rapist behavior. You could also start and stop physical sexual activities and see if he gets angry, cries, pushes, or tries to manipulate you.

This will all help you find someone who is good in bed, cares about giving you pleasure and won't pressure you. Vet hard for any porn behavior. A porn adict will not make it through all of this without repeatedly revealing himself to be a low value creep.

Edited to add


A follower in the notes asked how you can avoid going too far once you start and how to tell the guy your boundaries:

You have to be strong and probably have some sort of a deadline that you'll stick to like a restaurant reservation or a time he needs to leave by. I would also do some of my making out and touching in the car at night when he would bring me home from a date. You really shouldn't have to even make any boundaries clear. A man who's actually interested in you isn't going to try to move every touch to sex. If he does, that's a red flag. If he tries to move things further than you're willing to go just tell him this is as far as you're willing to go with the level that you know him and you're still getting comfortable with him. Trust is earned. Tell him you want to move slowly with intimacy so that you are fully comfortable and because you're still getting to know him and trust him.

Say you're making out a little and he starts trying to take your top off. Just use your hand and put it on his hand and stop him and say no. This should be all you need to do. This is another vetting opportunity as well. If he tries again 2 minutes later then he's a pushy creep who isn't listening to you! He has failed.


Here's my response to another commenter about how are not given any sort of conceptual framing for progressing through physical intimacy and up to sex in stages:

I really didn't understand this when I was younger either. Society very much pushes this have sex immediately narrative on women. We're not given any tools to judge a man sexually, even when it comes to our own safety. No information on how to figure out if a guy is a rapey creep. Nothing. There's no longer any narrative about making out, necking, petting or working up to things for months. Or at all.  No ""going steady"" which implies a greater level of physical intimacy based on commitment, trust, time and investment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hv99u8/how_to_vet_for_sexual_compatibility/,1595345063.0,286,0.95,44,FemaleDatingStrategy,Phoenix__Rising2018
hv8nr1,I finished the handbook and broke up with my bf of 1.5 years,"My bf (23m) and I (22f) met on IG when I was in a horrible place in every possible way (sort of like an existential crisis) and he had a mindset and persona that was very new to me so I was fascinated by him and drawn to him. He was exactly what I was looking for at the time because I was looking for someone who could give me ‚Äúanswers‚Äù. He helped me with my state and gave me a whole new perspective that contributed to a huge change in me including that of religious and political beliefs (which I still have). He was condescending at times but I had zero self worth at the time and thought I deserved it. So you can guess what happened when I went from being extremely lonely to having ‚Äúdeep‚Äù conversations with a guy everyday. I got attached to him and idolized him (I had never even seen his face). I would think to myself this is the guy I want to marry (oh, naive me). 

We were friends for two years but would gradually only talk twice a month due to ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù reasons since he‚Äôs in a strict shite country. (We‚Äôre both middle eastern just for context and we have the same ethnicity but our families are of different, very opposing, religious sects). After a while I noticed he was being flirty with me and thought he was trying to indirectly tell me that he likes me. He started paying a lot of attention to me so we called and talked and played everyday. I was waiting for him to directly tell me that he likes me but he didn‚Äôt so I did ü§°. so we just went on from there without even dating and got into a relationship that had me hating it and confused for so long and one significant reason being that he was not the same person when we were just friends. He was very depressed at the time so I blamed our messy relationship on that and thought that I should ‚Äúhelp‚Äù him until he gets better. But it was just him showing his true colors. He was holding up the LVM flag and I was completely blind to it. 

So in the course of our relationship we had a lot of ups and downs and I broke up with him a few times for petty things he said/did. He always talked me back into it. I decided to stay with him if he changed for me. And he did get better. But I was still uncomfortable and always felt like something was wrong. That‚Äôs when I came across this subreddit. Upon reading the handbook I realized how many things were wrong and how both of us were LVs. I had made up my mind on everything but one thing that was bothering me was that he is not a bad guy and has improved a lot since the beginning but I had to cut the relationship off regardless, because of how drained I was feeling. even though he was supportive too but he would still disappoint me sometimes and I lost attraction gradually.                                                 
And btw, we‚Äôve never met in person. Ever. Which is another huge mistake we made. 

Besides all of this, we have our families in the way. My parents would never accept me marrying him. So even if we were a flawless couple, we would still have a huge problem ahead of us. And I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs worth going through all that trouble for. 

The feeling to end things became very strong in me and now here I am single and clear headed after 1.5 years of on and off confusion. 

And that‚Äôs all thanks to this subreddit. I‚Äôm very grateful for you queens‚Äô hard work and care. It didn‚Äôt help me solely relationship wise, but also personality and lifestyle wise. I never realized how many of my problems were due to low self worth. I‚Äôm definitely not an exact HVW right now but there‚Äôs been a significant shift and it‚Äôs ongoing.

Currently reading this and I will recommend it to anyone.  Women need to realize these things and keep themselves safe. An example that is brought up is the subject of pets, how women will say ""my pet never liked him"", but it actually often is the case of your pet picking up on the vibes you are giving of about a person and reacting to it and how we do not trust our own premonitions and we rationalize about dangerous situations. Trust your intuition and read books such as this to learn how to be safe. It can literally help save the life of yourself and your loved ones.

hurtrw,Grown Ass Men Ending Marriages Over Porn &amp; Anime Women.,"My husband (29) and I (28) have been together for ten years, married for four. He was, and is, an addict. He was sexually abusive towards me for six years, was watching porn under my nose in my house and at work, which I discovered years later. After we separated for six months over it, I set clear boundaries: No porn/sexually explicit/questionable material or we're done. No excuses. He went to a few therapy sessions and attended SA for two years, claiming he was in recovery. I never fully believed him. I guess my intuiton is too good.

Low and behold, a month ago, I found that my (soon to be) ex husband was watching anime videos on YouTube. These videos featured heavy chested Asian anime characters in scantily clad outfits, with the camera focusing on their bodies in the entire scene.

This fool, who claimed to be ""in recovery"" actually had the audacity to say the following to me upon confronting him:

""But...it's not porn."" (Delusional)

""You're judging me off of two videos!"" (Gaslighting)

""So you're just going to ignore all the other videos I watched that aren't like that??"" (Gaslighting)

""Can you stop doing this???"" (Avoidant, Gaslighting)

""It's a fight scene! You can clearly see it's a fight!"" (Gaslighting)

""IF it bothers you, I won't watch it anymore."" (Gaslighting, he knew my boundaries and chooses to play dumb, as if he couldn't imagine why watching ""a AnImE FiGht"" would be inappropriate)


A day later, he admits he ""wasn't as recovered as he thought he was"" and ""watched one video and went down a rabbit hole.""

I immediately snapped my fingers, said ""we're done,"" and walked out. He stopped going to SA and used COVID as an excuse, not even following up to see when they'd reopen. He also has ADHD and stopped going to his doctor to seek medical treatment. I will never ignore my gut again. I knew he was flaking, I just stayed silent and observed. And what I knew all along, was right. 

Not even a week prior to this, I admitted myself to the hospital on the verge of a breakdown and on the phone, he was in tears telling me ""he's not that person anymore."" 

This Man plays video games for hours on end, puts more effort into game achievements than he does in his own life. Now we sleep in separate rooms, and I walked into his bedroom to find a bowl of dessert from two days ago in the closet, ketchup bottle on the floor, crumbs of food and a chicken bone with an old Popeyes box on the floor. Blanket and pillow laying on the ground, with his TV and Playstation set up on our ironing board for him to play. I can't believe I actually saw potential in him. He piggybacked off my ambition. I was in the process of starting a cleaning company which he was going to drop his own plans to become an electrician to join. Past me would have been impressed by the ""support."" The REAL me sees this is someone with no ambition and low motivation that's perfectly fine following someone else's plans and taking no initiative to do better for HIMSELF.

A part of me feels sorry for him because he's losing me and my family that were a HUGE support system to him, more than they should've been. But I don't pity him. 


Unfortunately I'm stuck in a lease with this fool, barely employed, and have seven months to get my shit together on my own or I'll be homeless with three cats.

Please help restore my sanity and reassure me that I'm not trippin'

huo48e,"Reminder: When a woman wants a man to initiate, she's looking for him to demonstrate interest, confidence, attraction, effort, investment, and capability. When a man wants a woman to initiate, he wants to put in less effort.","I often see men on Reddit mention how they'd love it if a woman *""took initiative and asked them out for a change.""* As you know from the FDS handbook, this is a big no.

The simple premise behind this is that men will go after the things they want. If a man is interested in you, he will let you know through his actions: asking you out, communicating with you, planning the first date, asking for exclusivity, etc. Women should being using a man's approach to help us evaluate his character and to vet him. If he is not pursuing you, he is not interested in you (regardless of what story you are telling yourself).

When women chase, men aren't using her words and actions to help him evaluate her character. He's not thinking *""wow, here's a great woman who shows initiative and plans thoughtful dates.""* He's thinking *""well, this is easy enough and I don't have anyone else on my radar, so why not?""* Not only is a man going to say yes to a woman he's only lukewarm about because it doesn't require any effort from him, he's going to take that as a sign that he doesn't need to invest as much in the relationship moving forward.

We are trying to make you understand that you are a strong woman and a human being. You don‚Äôt BELONG to anyone because you aren‚Äôt an object.

hu8kbd,LVM and shaving,"Over the past few years and toxic relationships I‚Äôve noticed that LVM tend to share a very common trait: being obsessed with women being 100% shaved all the time. 

In my most recent relationship with a NVM the scrote wouldn‚Äôt go down on me unless I shaved down below EVERY SINGLE DAY. On top of that, he was very pornsick and watched a lot of hentai - couldn‚Äôt keep it hard if his life depended on it. He would even go limp during penetration but probably thought I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell.

Shaving that area too soon after the hair starts growing makes me bleed A LOT and irritates me badly. I was very much a pickme and would spend hours in the shower every week bleeding everywhere only to make sure I got every tiny little hair. 

The loser even stated that he likes it fully shaved and ‚Äúnot looking like a jungle, because I‚Äôm not an explorer‚Äù. Yet he hadn‚Äôt shaved his disgusting pubes since puberty and I would frequently have them stuck around after sex. Gross as shit. Not to mention that he had nails and TOENAILS longer than some girls with acrylics.

Now that I‚Äôm out of that shithole I shave every 4 days, as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm personally happy and comfortable with. I‚Äôve also strongly come to consider shaving for men as a very pick-me trait.

I also personally believe that men who make a fuss out of a girl‚Äôs shaving habits are LVM and heavily pornsick. While I understand having a preference, trying to impose that on your girlfriend or attempting to change her habits in your favour is 100% not HVM behaviour.

What is your take on this, ladies? Would you ever shave for a man? Do you consider them being opinionated about your body hair to be inappropriate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hu8kbd/lvm_and_shaving/,1595194164.0,98,0.95,14,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

hu826h,My personal experience with breadcrumbing,"I saw the post on Breadcrumbing a while back and I was wondering why it sounded so familiar to me only to remember this particular situation that had me so messed up for a long time. I'm still in therapy for the backlash of it.

Back when I was young (17) and dumb and (Fill in the blank with the rest of the phrase), I started dating this guy we'll call him Johnathan. He was 19, sweet, nice, funny, ultimate package (at the time). We met while we were both enlisting in the military. I was enlisting in the Army and he, the Air Force. We became friends and then decided to be exclusive. He took me to my senior prom, we saw each other every day before we shipped out to basic, even went on a quick mini vacay out of town the week before we left. It was perfect in my eyes.

In basic training, you have limited access to outside communication so we wrote each other letters. I actually still had his letters until about a month ago when I burned them, for some reason I couldn't be bothered to burn them sooner. They were just put away in a box somewhere in my house. So for 10 weeks that's all we had. In tech school (job training), we had a little more communication. It wasn't much, but in my mind ""we're both so busy so it is what it is"".

When we finished training, I came back home to MS because I was National Guard, but Johnathan went to Florida for his duty station. No big deal. We made plans for me to come see him for his birthday a few weeks later, I paid for my plane ticket, he picked me up, and it was a week of just fun in Florida. We even almost eloped, but something in my gut told me, ""nope, don't do that. Just wait on it."" So we didn't.

Not even a month after I made it back to Mississippi, little homie started dropping off the face of the earth like this was cool. He'd go days, weeks, without answering a phone call or a text, but then would pop up out of nowhere like it was all good. I explained away everything like its no big deal. This went on for about 3 or so months. After that, I got straight radio silence 10 months before we were supposed to get married. Plans had been made, things just needed to be paid for. I know, I was an idiot. It took a lot to learn.

It wasn't until I was invited on a trip to Florida (Two years after we started dating mind you) with a friend girl of mine, that's when shit hit the fan. I went, had some fun, tried to ignore the fact that my supposed boyfriend thought it was cool to just drop off the face of the earth like that. I snapped and told her I'll be back, I'm taking a drive. I drove to the Air Force Base, remembered where this dude lived, knocked on the door and told him we needed to talk. He took his time answering the door. When I walked in, I saw the evidence of another woman and I had seen enough. Cool bro. You found you another woman, but you couldn't be bothered to tell your fiance that you didn't want to be with her anymore? That was too much?

He fed me the bullshit of he was just scared of getting married, and he didn't know what to do or to say and didn't want to hurt me. He loved me, but just needed to take some time to figure himself out. I took the bait. I was pissed, he knew I was, and he gave me what I wanted to calm me down. He said give him some time to sort himself out and we'll make it work. So I went back to Mississippi a happy woman because I thought I had made some good progress in this. I thought that was what strong women did. As soon as I left his presence, I received only more radio silence. He would shoot me a text every now and again, but after I got comfortable with talking to him again, he was a ghost.

He did that to me for about two more times over the span of two more years, and I hated myself for allowing it to happen. I only stopped it because every time he did it, he was with a new girl, and he would cheat on that girl with me. The last time we were in each others presence, he was telling me that he had a baby on the way. And I wasn't going to allow him to defile me any further, especially knowing that he was doing another woman dirty who was carrying his child. The breadcrumbing hurt me to the core to the point where I now have some serious insecurity issues. Hell, I'm married with my own child, and I still have the occasional fear that my HUSBAND may think I'm not enough for him. It took me a long time to bring myself back to some type of sensibleness, and therapy was a huge part in that. I just wish I had recognized it sooner so the damage could be minimized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/hu826h/my_personal_experience_with_breadcrumbing/,1595192454.0,98,0.96,3,FemaleDatingStrategy,CreativeInitial2

I told him I've had enough of his behaviour and that it wasn't healthy for me, and wasn't healthy for him.

Among the various tricks and whining that then ensued (you can imagine I'm sure) he proceeded to complain about women his own age and why they were no good.

 I told him he was just HOLDING UP A MIRROR TO HIMSELF. 

Every complaint about them was just total nonsense. It ranged from he didn't really want sex anymore to they werent attractive and he didnt want to have to listen to them talk about their grandkids.

I said if that's how you think about women your own age, I can assure you that's how women  think about you.

He then insisted that ""I just didn't understand"" and tried to give me the option of having a relationship with him ""where I could be physical with someone else""

Who cares that I'm not interested apparently. Just here's another option so he can make it work for him. 

More than anything he seems to take great pleasure in letting his friends know he's ""going to visit me"".

htu2mj,A real life example of a HVM,"I recently visited a high value couple that I have known for my entire life, her being a SAHM raising their 4 children, him working in a high salary sector. The wife was diagnosed with THREE forms of cancer in the last six months. She is doing okay, but probably has only a few years left, at most. 

Here‚Äôs how her high value husband handled the situation: bought her her dream river-front house a few miles from their children/grandchildren, retired from his job to be present with her every moment of every day she has left. He is currently fixing up the orchard on the property so she can continue to can and jam the fruit, her favorite hobby. We went for a walk after lunch and every few minutes he asked her how she was doing/if she needed to turn back, asking ‚ÄúHow are you doing, my sweet wife?‚Äù.

I just wanted to share this incredible couple because we hear so few stories of men who truly treasure the women in their lives. Yes, they are of an older generation, but their children have witnessed a HV relationship and have mirrored those traits in their own lives as well.

htswoi,Re: men age like wine and are in their prime in their 40s. GOD HOW I WISH THAT WERE TRUE,"I'm 38 and a frequent poster at datingover30 but obviously I'm not allowed to say this there, so hi. I'm secretly obsessed.

You see this a lot at datingover30: ""men are in their prime later in life.""

God. I wish. I wish so hard that that were true.

My country has been quarantined for months. During those months i met lovely men and have enjoyed chatting, one even here on reddit. I was so excited to start meeting them in person. I've met 3 now and exchanged pics with 3 more. Decent guys. 

But...

No one prepares you for how physically unappealing these ""prime"" aged men are. It's like turning down the aisle of a Halloween shop where they keep the creepy masks.

I want to cry.

Worst part is i think i just have to get past this and look past their looks? I guess? I hate to be shallow. Really i do. But I'm so disappointed. Coming to terms with the fact that this is just what reality looks like. I like sex with younger men. But there's no way I'd enter a relationship with a young man.

My husband passed years ago. I wasnt ready to date back then. Which i regret. Back then the dating pool was a lot of men who divorced for understandable reasons (actual incompatibilities that were overlooked because of marrying too young). Now the good looking ones that are divorced in their 40s and up seem to be divorced because they're cheaters and sex addicts. That right there filters out tons of them. Oh and 40 plus year old fuck bois, dont foget those guys. So now whats left is the normal but unattractive guys. It seems like.

htsfn7,Recovering Pickmeisha in need of advice. How do I react when the bill arrives at the end of a date?,"Hello all. Recovering Pickmeisha here. I'm relatively new to this sub and absolutely love it. Before I found this sub, I always used to split the bill or pay for dates. Men rarely picked up the tab. Now that I've found FDS, I'm trying to level up and deprogram my ""Pick Me"" behaviour. I was a serial bill splitter and paid for men much more often than they paid for me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I now realise that I wanted to be the ""cool girl"" and show them I'm a ""strong independent woman."" Thankfully I  lurked this sub and realised how insecure I probably was and that expecting a man to pay does not take away my independence or degrade it in any way. It's simply a standard that I SHOULD have. Also male approval or attention ain't shit. I'm genuinely starting to think that women insisting on paying for dates or bill splitting comes across as desperate for  approval to men. So they're more likely to test your boundaries and disrespect you.

I want advice on how to react when the bill arrives?  Do some of you offer to pay/split then bill and then ghost if he allows it? Or simply smile at the guy and do nothing? It usually feels like such an awkward moment when the bill arrives. If the guy refuses to pay or insists on splitting the bill, how do I react or respond with class in the moment? I know I'll be deleting and blocking guys after the date if they pull shit like that. I suppose my struggle is how to react or respond 1) in the moment when the bill arrives and 2)if the guy insists on splitting?",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/htsfn7/recovering_pickmeisha_in_need_of_advice_how_do_i/,1595123035.0,87,0.94,44,FemaleDatingStrategy,londochig

The gathering took place on a terrace of a restaurant. The husband of said couple came to sit at my table for a while. We were conversing, and suddenly his face lit up. I turned around to see what he was looking at, and saw his wife several tables away holding a glass full of wine and smiling. Turns out that he, even though he had gotten up from their table to go mingle with other people, had constantly kept an eye over the room on his wife's glass, and had ordered the waiter to bring her a new one as soon as her glass was empty. She gave him a smile, he smiled back at her, and then said, ""This thing never gets old. Ordering your wife a glass of wine - such a small thing that always makes me happy."" I loved how he nailed the HVM mindset - the mere fact of taking care of your wife and doing little considerate things that makes her feel appreciated is a source of happiness if you are a HVM.

A dude then approached me with this really awkward line, saying he liked my dress and asking where I got it so he could buy it for a woman. I thought it might have been a legitimate question, but then he started asking me what I was listening to, asking if the dress would be a good gift, and generally forcing conversation. I eventually told him he was making me uncomfortable and left.

I‚Äôve been cold approached many, many times in my life and it‚Äôs never been anything less than this intense degree of awkward. Dudes think they‚Äôre being smooth but the lack of self-awareness required to think walking up to a woman who is alone, wearing headphones, at night, on a dark street is a good approach is really something.

hreu4l,"Opinion: FDS works because, although it gives women tools, it isn‚Äôt a rigid worldview - it is dynamic.","From what I can tell, FDS is a fairly diverse group that celebrates women‚Äôs autonomy and value not ONLY as women - but also as complex human beings. 

FDS is a dynamic and ever growing pool of wisdom and shared experiences aimed at garnering a better situation for women as a whole. Therefore it adapts itself to the ‚Äúlevels‚Äù and lifestyles of many very different people.

So-called ideologies such as TRP and MGTOW, on the other hand, aren‚Äôt nearly as nuanced. Everything I have seen in these groups willfully and stubbornly shoves the world into very specific boxes, especially in the realm of gender but also in other ways as well (such as the ‚Äúvalid‚Äù types of masculinity vs ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù ones by their estimation). These boxes are really one dimensional.

FDS has certain underlying values and standards, but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more nuanced. That is something I think women are generally much better at - adapting. And therein lies our strength and ability to continue growing.

The aforementioned manosphere groups view adaptability itself as weakness...which is literally against the entire biological basis of evolution.

What is discussed most frequently here is that it costs more to be a woman in this world. Our daily maintenance is much more expensive and time consuming than a man‚Äôs BEFORE we even consider what it takes to get ready for a date. Even if you‚Äôre a low maintenance women, you spend more than the average male on your daily hygiene, maintenance and care

Let‚Äôs not even get into all of the statistics of men who are deadbeat dads and men who leave their long term marriages with SAHM‚Äôs for younger women

What is less often discussed is the fact that if a man is not just in it for  sex, he will be willing to make an investment in treating you well and getting to know you in the PROPER setting of an evening out at a PUBLIC place and treating you to a meal so that you feel SAFE, secure and desired. How else can you open up and get to know someone if you don‚Äôt feel not just safe, but special?

Every other guy is just a throwaway. Block and delete

And if he can‚Äôt afford to spend $25 on a meal for a women, he deserves the ole‚Äô block and delete. If he wants to be able to seriously date you, he needs to be able to afford everything it takes to go forward with a secure future and start a life together.

h8afi6,Not Everyone Can Be Saved or Deserves Sympathy,"Even though I believe in supporting women, there are absolutely limits on how much emotional labor is wasted on someone who refuses help.

Take for example, my pickme coworker. She's simultaneously the most insecure and arrogant person I've ever met. Every day it's another story about her husband and 20 something year old sons pushing her around and dictating what goes on in the household. She's not allowed to use her own money or go to doctors without permission. Home repairs have been left unfinished for years. It's an absolute shitshow.

Yet she also tries to impart unsolicited wisdom on me by saying that men can be trained. That marriage can't happen without compromise. That women need to lower their standards. I've received tons of backhanded remarks about being single (e.g. ""You're so brave for not being married at your age!""). There are a number of other microaggressions that, in isolation, don't seem that bad. After dealing with this for almost two years, I've just about had it. I used to show genuine concern and support, but she gets so fucking defensive that it's not worth it. In fact, I've gotten a better reaction from her when I walk away mid conversation. Now I always end conversations with her when it turns into a therapy session or the Pickme TED Talk channel. I flat out tell her to stop because she's being rude. I no longer want to hear it.

In a previous lifetime, I felt pity for her. Ever since I found FDS, this feeling has turned into disgust. I'm disgusted that although her life is awful, it's actually pretty tame compared to the posts I've seen on here. I'm disgusted that the man she decided to have multiple children with is a shit man who raised additional shit men. 

Ultimately, I'm disgusted that she's taking pleasure in being a martyr for a life she chose and is actively trying to recruit other women into her ""lifestyle."" I see this a lot in person and online. Logic can't convince these women that they deserve to be treated like human beings. Telling the truth is a thankless task. I'm going to keep speaking up when I see shitty behavior, but I'm definitely more picky about who I help these days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/h8afi6/not_everyone_can_be_saved_or_deserves_sympathy/,1592064990.0,181,0.96,27,FemaleDatingStrategy,suzumerricat

I'll start with my most recent ex:

We would make plans for a Saturday at 4. I'd get off work around 1-2 pm,  and rush my entire hour commute home. I'd rush to shower, do my hair and makeup, get dressed and drive another 20 minutes to his house. I'd call when I was close to say I might be a few minutes late and I'm so sorry. 

Then I'd get there, and he'd answer the door in clothes he slept in. Unshowered. Dishes left in the sink from when I came over and cooked the previous weekend. He gives me a kiss and then sits down at his computer, saying he was just about to get in the shower he just wants to finish a video. 

I let this exact scenario happen an embarrassing number of times until one day on my drive over I said ""if you're not ready when I get there I'm going home"" and when I arrived **he was in the shower and his door was locked**.  ü§¨ I actually stood and waiting a few minutes before I realized I was a god damn clown and just left. 

I enjoyed my time at home way more than with him. Now when I get off work from my stressful physical job I take long baths and put on pretty pajamas.

h87nn6,Don't date people who don't value your time. Point blank.,"If there's one thing I've learned over the course of my relationships it is this - Date people who value your time. I had a date last week, where I met a guy who showed up 20 minutes late and sat down without even apologizing. He literally just started talking, as if nothing had happened. You can bet your bottom dollar I stood up. ""How hard it is for you to respect my time, when I'm doing you a favor just by being here? "", I said, ""You obviously think you're entitled to this date, but I can assure you you're misguided. Have a day."" Then I left a tip and left. He looked like I smacked him. People who think your time is expendable, don't value you. The very act communicates disrespect. Point blank. If I can get there on time, so can he. It's not like he doesn't own a watch or can't see the time on his smartphone. He's just not making me a priority, which means, surprise, the relationship won't be a priority later on. This goes the same for cancelling dates last minute without good cause, not being flexible to work around your schedule, and calling/texting at all hours like I'm always available.

h7sooq,I moved on!,"Thanks to all the ladies/posts here that helped me move on from these useless trashbags. I realized that I was lacking at self love and care.

I've been so heavily dependant upon guys to make me happy for some years now. The guys I've been with, always asked for my nudes and I thought it was normal for a guy to ask for them and normal for a female to send them. I've always felt a little gross after sending them, never thought much of it. So I sent my nudes to every guy that I thought I had an emotional connection with.

I have big boobs so they seem to attract guys, and that made me feel bad because it wasn't my brain or my personality that attracted them in the first place.

It was also strange because I had these string of guys yet I felt so lonely and hollow at times and always wondered why was that. I did everything those guys said, sweet-talked them, boosted their ego.

Now that I look back at it all, I realise that I was giving them a part of me everytime I agreed to do something that I didn't want to.

I learnt to say no. I separated myself from all the assholes, I'm purely single now. Doing that hurt me for a day or two because I had no one to compliment me (it's pathetic really). But I can see things more clearly now.

I know some people do question a woman's character if she sends nudes, but I did what I thought was right at the moment and would keep those guys near me.

Now I know I don't really need a dude to make me happy. I've been spending more time with the people who matter the most - my family and friends.

This also made me pick up on my academics and I'm planning to work on myself further. My main goals for this quarantine are to:

- Learn a language
- Cook some new dishes
- Pursue my hobbies
- Take care of my brain and body

Two weeks later he texts asking if I‚Äôm upset at him and I say yes. He asks why and I tell him. (The fact that he didn‚Äôt already know, and waited two weeks to ask...)

He claims that he called twice and both times his calls went to voicemail. Ok, whatever. Could‚Äôve texted but okay. I tell him send me my gifts then (which he obviously didn‚Äôt get.)

h7897s,"Don't EVER let a relationship start with ""sorry""","I am dating online and I am over 35. At any age, the pool of men on online dating is already filled with LVM but after 35.....well the pool is the same except they are also fatter, shorter, angrier, uglier, balder, no excuse for being broke and have lots of baggage.

Anyway, I was really excited yesterday to have matched on Hinge with a guy whose message I read and just...you know, felt that feeling like hmmm! He has my attention! Then I saw his profile and he felt familiar and good and impressive to me on many levels.

We started chatting and wow! Finally someone who knows how to carry a conversation with great spelling and grammar, have natural curiosity, have a sense of humor and provide thoughtful answers!

At one point he stopped to comment that he didn't want to lead with looks but he was blown away by my beauty AND he couldn't believe how fun this conversation was and how smart I was.

Around six oclock, he said he was ""going out for wings with a friend"" but he wanted to pick up this awesome conversation later this evening? I agreed.

Eleven pm rolls around, still haven't heard from this dude who was giving me hope again (big mistake, I know this, I know not to get too excited about any man, especially ones online, especially ones I have not known for at least 72 hours, let alone 3 months). I was going to unmatch him at that point but figured, you know what, let me give him until midnight (when you find yourself rationalizing anything or pushing your limits on minor things, this is a bad sign already).

So I left it, got distracted and forgot.

12:16 I get a message back from him that sorry, his evening ended up going on longer than he thought! He then carried on the convo like nothing happened.

I have to be honest. I can't, can't start any kind of relationship on a basis of ""sorry"". Nope, I did not feel I could respond to that message and still maintain my dignity.

Keep in mind a lot of these dudes feel lesser than when you're a beautiful woman and they do subtle things to try and take you down a peg and then chime in with ""oops! sorry"".

I was first wary of the subtle triangulation of ""a friend"". Some people literally do this on purpose. Myself if I am going to meet a friend or going on a date, I would just tell someone I am chatting with that I've got to run.

I had to think about this one. Has there been a time when I met ""a friend"" for food at 6:30 and then had no access to my phone until after midnight? Nope. Not since my twenties when we'd go hit the town after.

I had a bad feeling about it. I unmatched him.

I really shouldn't have had to think about it so much but ruthlessness improves over time and this is good practice.

Don't ever start a relationship on some man's oops sorry.

If he can't keep a simple promise, or pushes the limits of them (probably to test you), axe his ass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/h7897s/dont_ever_let_a_relationship_start_with_sorry/,1591914941.0,135,0.95,16,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

h0qn53,Since when is anger not an emotion?,"I‚Äôve always found it funny that women are considered to be incredibly emotional (often in a negative light) and our heightened emotions are commonly used to support misogynistic theories that label us as weak or irrational. 

For example, even in this day and age, there are many people who feel as though women are ‚Äòtoo emotional‚Äô to hold leadership positions. 

Take rapper T.I. for example, who actually had the nerve to open his useless mouth and express his atrociously sexist views live on air. The Neanderthal proudly stated that he would never vote for a woman president, because we are too emotional. 

[T.I. explains why he wouldn‚Äôt vote for a woman president](https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4071617/ti-woman-president-hillary-clinton/%3famp=true) 

Image what sort of uproar would ensue if a well-known celeb were to say they would never vote for a president of a certain ethnicity or skin color etc. 

But, no one gave a shit about his divisive, illogical, and outdated rhetoric, of course, because nobody gives a shit about women, but I digress; 

My question is: who in the love of FUCK decided that anger wasn‚Äôt an emotion? 

Males are the most emotional creatures to walk the earth. They are reactive, volatile, and will literally burn their house to the ground in a fit of rage over a video game. 

Males make up 80.1% of all violence in the United States, 99.6% of all perpetrators of homicide globally, etc. The list goes on. 

Males are the creators of war; of terror.

It BAFFLES me that our emotions are used against us when our emotions never result in death and destruction. 

God forbid we cry to naturally purge our emotions rather than beat the shit out of the family golden retriever. 

Women allow our bodies natural biological response to emotional stimuli to ensue, and that somehow makes us...weak? 

Got it. Lol. 

If there is any gender that is emotionally unfit to hold leadership positions, it certainly isn‚Äôt us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/h0qn53/since_when_is_anger_not_an_emotion/,1591844141.0,115,0.97,19,FemaleDatingStrategy,imgoingmadz

Firstly, I would suggest just breaking up. If that's not an option/ you're feeling bold, tell your partner of your epiphany and ask them for what you now need to stay in the relationship.

I try to respect people's boundaries and usually stay to myself especially if I am going to an environment that is filled with couples like church, weddings, etc. It almost makes you just want to get a boyfriend so people can be breath a sigh of relief around you lol.

h04pdj,Being passive aggressive is the key,"I used to voice out and explain to guys of what i was hurt and they didn‚Äôt listen, never. So i stopped talking and whenever they try to manipulate me, i go silent on text. 

If the guy is showing low efforts? I ghost on them on supposed dates. I‚Äôve done this many many times but make sure you dont give them your real number. My whatsapp is linked to my fake number. 

If the guy is mentioning other girls? Mention guys who are your type having opposite physical traits from him. 


If the guy is cheap? Don‚Äôt even bring your wallet on a date so he is forced to pay. 

If a guy asks you when we‚Äôre going to hangout? Don‚Äôt try to convince him to take you out on dates, rather, ghost them. 

The best way is to slowly fade and ghost them. They‚Äôll be left wondering what they did wrong and continue doing so until it backfires on them. 

After learning FDS, i keep my mouth shut, smile like a lady and ignore them if something doesn‚Äôt go right. Then they chase harder. 

Also dont text him at night. I try not to text a guy during 8pm to 8am. 

If a guy asks for more pics, send him ‚Äòhis‚Äô pics. 

Also do not ever pay on dates.

If the guy qsks something you dont want to answer such as sexual history just act like you didnt hear him. Even in text, i send him ‚Äú i didnt receive anything, could you send again ? ‚Äú then they eventually get tired. 

Once my ex narc was manipulating me, i just acted like he was invisible and he went crazy and eventually apologized and fixed his behavior. Narcissism and manipulators thrive on attention so dont give them the power to have it. 

I thought of how to weed out red pilled guys for few months, basically just weed out manipulative guys and guys who give backhanded effort. Also ugly guys. If they say things like ‚Äúif you dont do X then i‚Äôll block you‚Äù, make the first move and block him. If he does LV1 action, go one step further and do LV2 action.  My ex used to be late on dates so after that, i‚Äôd be late an hr, then he stopped being late and became punctual. Do not ever do things that‚Äôs expected, always surprise him with your actions in order to fix him. 

Also, if i really want to lose the guy who i thought was HvM but instead manipulative and LVM, i keep telling them how tired and sick i am. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stressed out and tired because of my work‚Äù. No one wants to hear this so they eventually get lost. 


I‚Äôm asian so i always get asked out where i‚Äôm from, and lot of times guys who ask those questions are lVM who‚Äôs seeking submissive girls. I‚Äôd say 90%, those guys are considered unattractive in their own culture, and these are the type of guys who date minorities. This might be controversial, but after this, i dont date guys who‚Äôs considered ugly in thier own culture. When you meet a guy from different culture/race esp minorities tend to overestimate the guy‚Äôs looks. I‚Äôve seen numerous times(mostly in the states) where asian girl dates a guy for the sake of him being white and decent looking and realize he‚Äôs LvM. In this case its important to study the culture and compare how he treats you and also how women from that culture thinks of him on attractiveness scale. 

In my culture therees a saying ‚Äúyou cannot spit on a smiling face‚Äù meaning you cannot show anger on calm, gentle demeanor. So i started being more calm to guys and dont call them out, rather ghost on them. Opposite of love isn‚Äôt hate but is  apathy.  If i successfully use this tactics, guys usually fix up or just take themselevs out from the trashcan. 

Even dating, i do not give out much personal information which they can manipulate me but rather something very generic and vague. I used to use fake name, age and also lied about the place i was living in. It might be too much but it was for my own safety as you never know what kind of guy you‚Äôre meeting on OLD

One thing i learned using OLD is if you lower your standards and give chance to guys who are below you, they think that youre on the same level as them when you‚Äôre not. So do not ever date someone who is less than you.  

I used to dress up casually after moving here and didnt make much effort in creating classy looks, then scrotes and LVm started approaching me. After that i never ever dress up in revealing or clothes that give me cheap or easy looks. Make it appear that youre hard to approach and i noticed quality guys approach. Also, being slim is very important. I hate to say this, but when i was skinny/slim HvM approached me more.

Also pls check mindful attraction 2.0 for reading guy's mind. I've successfully applied some tactics learned from thet YouTube channel.

I agree that this shouldn't be applied in healthy relationships but these days where most interactions are formed through OLD, I could say most guys are LVM. I'd say these tactics I suggested are safer method than calling out the guy. I've met numerous guys who are in higher socio economic backgrounds as average Joe but there are manipulators everywhere. 90% of the r/dating_advice and r/relationships questions revolve around girl being abused whether emotional or physical, and nowadays, I'm just not surprised anymore.

If the guy show's first sign of red flag, but your'e not sure if its red flag or not, ask yourself, "" What is my gut feeling telling me?"". I'd say every individual have different standards when it comes to red flag, but you should trust your gut feeling as its big data of life you lived so far. And this is proven by research that gut feeling is accurate. 

If you're inexperienced in dating, pls trust your gut feeling. Also, when you date a guy outside of your culture/race you're unfamiliar with, remember, that people are people no matter the country or culture. If the guy doesn't give you basic respect, LEAVE.

h02g1b,Doing the Work,"I've been in therapy since January. I found FDS in late February, early March. Today I had a phone session (due to pandemic) and my therapist ended the call by congratulating me on the work I'm doing and told me to keep it up. By no means am I fully healed. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a narcissist addict for six years. I tried to leave him once and he sucked me back in. Then six months after we ""completed"" couples counseling he started punching stuff and I left for good. That was the first step in me loving myself more than giving in to my want to be loved by someone else. 

It's been a little over a year since I left him. Yesterday would have been our first wedding anniversary. I've had ups and downs but the most tangible progress I have made has been in the three months since I found this sub. I've decided that I am going to become a HVW so I can be with a HVM. Because I deserve everything I choose to give myself in life. My entire adult life up to this point I didn't think I deserved anything. I thought I existed to please whatever man would give me the time of day. This sub has helped me to realize that I AM THE PRIZE. I am amazing and the men I wasted my twenties on with serial monogamy didn't deserve to breathe the same air as me let alone enjoy the life I delivered on a silver platter with a smile on my face just for them. 

To acheive the necessary mindset shift, I've been educating myself. Obviously I read this sub daily and it has been a huge part of the changes in my attitude and thinking. I also started using audible which has been life changing. Now I can do two to three books per week instead of maybe one per month. 

The first book that made a massive difference and really helped me to align with FDS principles was the newer version of ""The Rules"". Self explanatory. I also did ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking for Women"" by Allen Carr. Worked like a charm, I'm now a non smoker. This fact alone has done wonders for my mindset. I know now I can do the things I say I'm going to do and that I will show up for myself. In this shift, I now hold myself to a higher standard as well as the people in my life. If they're not going to show up for me the way I would show up for them I consider if that is a relationship I need to continue. Applying this to platonic relationships is practice for dating. 

I'm not actively dating yet. I'm doing what I need to do to be the kind of woman that will be with the kind of man I want to be with. Holding myself to the standards I will hold for him. Quitting smoking, working out daily, eating clean 80% of the time, these are things I want in a partner, so I need to be doing them too. As I'm doing them consistently my mindset is changing. I know I can expect better. Doing better for me allows me to expect better for me from other people. I am practicing enforcing boundaries. I am working on my life and leveling up my finances and career. I am setting realistic goals and enjoying the accomplishment of the daily habits that will help me reach them. (I highly recommend reading Atomic Habits and Off the Clock)

The last thing I want to say (and thank you if you've made it this far) is that I believe doing these things will lead me to the partner relationship I want. At my age and what I've put myself through, I am realistic. The traditional marriage, kids, white picket fence bit may not happen for me. I may never find my HVM. I have accepted this. I have grieved fully the loss of my best fertile years to LVM. But I still have hope. I still write and daydream about my HVM, my future husband. Sometimes this sub gets a little negative about the prospect of finding an HVM. But this is a DATING strategy and I will not give up hope. I am doing the work that I am doing because I want and need to do it for me. Because I deserve to give myself the kind of life I want to have. But I still believe that there is a partner for me who will meet me where I'm at and it will be amazing. I WAS being met where I was at before, and I never wanna be there again. But now I know better and I'm doing better. And if the man for me comes into my life, I will be ready because I've been doing the work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/h02g1b/doing_the_work/,1591757972.0,89,1.0,10,FemaleDatingStrategy,featherflowers

h0140s,REMINDER: GENUINE LOVE IS NOT JUST A *SOMETIMES* THING,"We all often heard things like these from women in a shitty relationship:

""He hits me and says mean things to me, but that's because he is angry/drunk/stressed etc. Other times he is nice and caring.""

""I just don't understand why he would say something like that... But other times he is nice.""

""He says he loves me. But sometimes he insults me/hurt my feelings/is mean to me etc.""

""It is my fault, if I had not offend him he wouldn't be angry and hit me/say things that hurt my feelings. When he is happy he buys me nice gifts and lavish me with words of love. He says he loves me.""

Here's the thing :- Genuine true LOVE is NOT something that can be turned on and off. Genuine love is simple - it is simply two people who love each other and is happy to be together. He is happy when you are beside him, and you are happy when he is beside you. And the two of you do things for each other simply because you want the partner to smile, to be happy - because that makes you happy too, so that the happiness can be twice as big. Even when the situation is harsh, you both are in it together, all hands on deck.

Yes, couple do fights, have miscommunications but it is not like what depicted in movies and dramas - you don't scream at each other faces and run away to weep at the top of the mountain or shit. That's not love, that's toxicity. Couple who genuine love each other engage in fights that are either funny (like how to pronounce ""egg"" or do ants fart) or a healthy debate - I prefer the x way, you prefer the y way, lets discuss. And you both either came to a balanced conclusions, or agree to disagree and respect each other's way.

There should be no hidden resentment because that shit can grow to the point you will fall out of love some day. Healthy couple strive to clear any dissatisfaction/resentment/anger and work as a team to solve the problem head on. There's no just one person do all the work while the other just laze and boss you around.

A very great example of what a genuine love looks like is this one, a boy in China gains 18kg to save his father who has blood cancer:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaGdbKRrpM&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaGdbKRrpM&amp;t=3s) 

There's no need to say much, but you can feel it deep in your core - that's love. Genuine, pure, raw *love*.

If you ever have to:

\- Question if your partner *truly* loves you

\- Feel alone and lonely even when your partner is there with out

\- Feel exhausted, feel like you are talking to a wall

\- Constantly have to bottle everything up and pretend everything is fine (even when it is not) so that you won't make him angry

\- Can never make new friends or spend time in peace with people other than him, because if you do he will be angry/jealousy/throws tantrums/sulk

\- Feel that you are the only one pulling the weights in the relationship, and have to nag him every single time so that he will do his share

\- Feels like your life is a constant walking on eggshells, afraid to make even a single mistake because you know he will get angry/sulk

\- Catch yourself looking forward to his next ""nice"" phase so that you can get the love, while silently enduring his ""not nice"" phase now. OR

\- Currently enjoying his ""nice"" phase now but silently dread the incoming ""not nice"" phase that you know will come with just a single misstep from your part.

Then you are not in a genuine love relationship. You are in a power-play relationship. He have the power you, and you have to do all the things he want in the way he wants every time he wants it, and he will ""reward"" you with the occasional ""love"" and nice gesture.

Remember, genuine true LOVE is NOT something that can be turned on and off. It is a feeling, a constant state of mind, heart, and soul - you can't just love one day, not love the next day.

But if the person is merely using the illusion of love and niceness to take advantage of you, that's when you will see the ""nice"" phase and ""not nice"" phase - because the ""love"" is just a tool for him, he doesn't feel it but he knows how to use it, pretend he has it. It is a lie - a very good lie, but still a lie.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/h0140s/reminder_genuine_love_is_not_just_a_sometimes/,1591752803.0,96,1.0,5,FemaleDatingStrategy,SayNad

gzwlco,My experience with a LVM made me realize that I was a LVW.,"I  considered going into detail about my experience with this particular LVM but have decided that he simply isn‚Äôt worth writing extensively about; this is about me. 

To summarize: the guy is a ridiculously attractive former-fat kid who is 100% ‚Äòred pilled‚Äô and employed his tactics on me when I was vulnerable. I‚Äôm sad to say‚Äîthey worked. 

I wasted time, energy, tears, and money on gas to drive over an hour on multiple occasions to essentially allow this piece of shit to use and abuse me for his own amusement. I fell for his bread-crumbing bullshit and held this loser on a pedestal. 

He never spent a dime on me and was even upset about having to make me breakfast when I stayed the night at his house.

Please, I implore you to laugh at me. I will laugh along. 

Over the course of six months, I spent hours and hours attempting to deconstruct this Neanderthals behavior and even more time attempting to get his attention. 

I became literally obsessed with his perception of me, to the point where literally everything I did, everything I posted, everything I dreamt about revolved around what he would think of it.

Wanna know what he was doing? 

Living his fucking life.

This guy never once gave a shit about me. And, why should he? I didn‚Äôt give a shit about myself. 

When I first met this guy I was at my lowest point. 

I was an alcoholic, adderall-dependent, weed-smoking, absolute fucking train-wreck. 

The first FaceTime we had, before we met in person, I was belligerent, and spontaneously agreed to stay with him and let him ‚Äòtake me out‚Äô in his city that weekend.

I was easy prey. 

The reality? I shouldn‚Äôt even have had the time or desire to go stay with some random guy in another city on my weekend off, let alone the time to FaceTime him.

As I sat and reflected on everything that went wrong; as I sat and counted the many red flags I should have caught before he had the nerve to trifle with me‚ÄîI began counting all the red fucking flags that I myself exhibited.

This guy had absolutely NO reason to take me seriously. I was a LVW.

And he definitely didn‚Äôt. I was nothing more than an ego boost for him. A trophy. 

I was coping with my ex moving on with another girl and had spent all my time post-breakup focused on bettering my physical appearance. 

And when my life didn‚Äôt turn into a Disney fairytale the second I got hot, I basically just lost it.

I was working 30 hours a week and going to school full time but was missing so many things from my life that I thought would just magically flock to me once I looked good. 

Although this guy is lacking many things I have‚Äîintegrity, kindness, wit, creativity, empathy, talent, decency‚Äîhe made me realize the many things I was lacking that he was not.

He is living the real college experience. He has roommates, a wide social circle of equally shitty douchebag bros, etc. 

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs what I was missing. Well, minus the douchebag bros.

I‚Äôm only 21, and had been in a relationship with a guy 4 years older than me since my senior year of high school which ended when I was 20 and finishing up my soph. year of college. I have lived at home during this time, and while I have maintained a decent social life during these past few years, most of my friends are not in school, working as bottle girls/bartenders etc. and we simply don‚Äôt have common interests. And while I enjoy clubbing, and will always love my day one friends, I definitely haven‚Äôt had that real college experience, and fuckboy chad made me realize...I want it. I envied him for it. He had something I didn‚Äôt‚Äîin turn, I put him on a pedestal. 

Fuck. That. 

The last time I wasted gas money to go see this whore was about two months ago. (Yes, it was during the onset of the pandemic when basically all college kids went back to their home towns. Yes, this means he was out of pussy and figured I‚Äôd be desperate enough to fall for his crumb toss in my direction, and yes, he was correct.) 

I had only just started to skim through FDS right before I made this last visit, and although it wasn‚Äôt yet enough to prevent me from wasting my time visiting this guy to be his personal sex slave, (I had convinced myself I was ‚Äòdoing it for ME and MY needs‚Äô üôÑ) it was at least enough for me to decide I wasn‚Äôt going to put up with his shit-tests and utter lack of substance for a minute too long. At the very first one, I said fuck it. I‚Äôm going home with the shred of dignity I have left. 

And as I drove home in my clown suit, I finally faced the music: there had never been any ‚Äòmisunderstandings,‚Äô or ‚Äòmiscommunications,‚Äô he was just a complete and utter soulless, mindless piece of shit who has 0 respect for me. He wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äònice guy‚Äô hiding under a ‚Äòrough‚Äô exterior. There is no ‚Äòtraumatic back story‚Äô that led to him being a piece of shit, and if there is, I don‚Äôt fucking care to hear it anymore. 

I once read on here that the way someone treats you is how they feel about you. There are no misunderstandings or communications. It‚Äôs really plain and simple. 

I think, as women, it‚Äôs hard for us to imagine that some human beings are genuinely bad.
Because most of us are kind and empathetic people who always try to consider the thoughts and feelings of others and the meaning(s) behind them, to accept the idea that some people are just shit human beings is almost unfathomable.  

But males are not like us; this is why they make up 99.6% of all perpetrators of homicide. This is why literally every robber, rapist, burglar, murderer, and literally every sack of shit on the planet is always‚Äîthat‚Äôs right‚Äîa male. 

And after this last visit, the fantasy of him was completely destroyed. He had OFFICIALLY dropped his mask. In fact‚Äîhe practically threw it off, and was proud to do so. After he made multiple attempts to push my boundaries for his personal amusement, I finally realized that this guy would literally never find anyone. The guy sucks. He‚Äôs hot, and definitely knows how to fuck, but he‚Äôll never form any real meaningful connections with people. He‚Äôs annoying. He‚Äôs rude. He‚Äôs unpleasant. He makes protein pancakes and eggs with literally NO seasoning because ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt eat sodium.‚Äù Fucking pompous bitch. All he knows is how to manipulate, and derive pleasure by shitting on others. He has to make people feel like shit to feel powerful. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis guy is literally beneath me. I‚Äôm no saint, but I can honestly say that I have lived my life always at least trying to do right by people. I have no enemies. I have never found joy in treating people the way this guy found joy in treating me. I‚Äôm a good person, and always will be. Chad is a bad person. Bad people rarely ever change. I can go to sleep at night with a smile on my face because I‚Äôm a good person. I don‚Äôt really care what mask he wears when he closes his eyes, but I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to wear it myself.

Anyways, it‚Äôs been two months since then, and so much has changed. To summarize: I have leveled the fuck up. 

The entire time I was with him he wouldn‚Äôt shut the fuck up about his upcoming internship in California over the summer and I was definitely sort of jealous. Fuck that. The second I got home I updated my resume and applied for a PR internship with this badass tech startup I had been eyeing for a minute but kept putting off. Two interviews later and the internship was mine. I started about 3 weeks ago and I am literally in love. 

I stopped smoking weed entirely but actually cut that out at the start of the new year. I drink socially still but NEVER drink alone and will NEVER use it as a coping mechanism. Ever. I use my ADD medication as prescribed, workout regularly, and I feel amazing. I have also (finally) been prescribed accutane after dealing with shitty skin for virtually my whole life and cannot waitttttt to see the results. May or may not act tf up.

I also signed my first lease for next school year and am going to be living in THE student housing spot near my campus. Like, this place is so fucking nice. Rooftop pool with a DJ on weekends...a sauna &amp;amp;amp;amp; shit nice. I already know a few people who live there so I have no doubt I‚Äôll be able to quickly get into the social life there and I am genuinely so fucking excited to finally get in on the shit I‚Äôve been missing out on. ü•≥üíï

BTW, chad never even checked to see if I made it home safely from my 1 and 1/2 hour drive, nor did he check in to see if I was okay or to apologize for his behavior. The guy literally wouldn‚Äôt have cared if my brains were splatted across the highway that evening. 

He has been removed from social media and his number has been blocked. It feels good to post things now because I want to, and not be constantly checking to see if he‚Äôs watching my stories/liking my posts, or posting certain things that I think he‚Äôd get jealous of etc. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Praise &amp;amp;amp;amp; validation from low quality people means nothing to me now, thanks to FDS. I am in absolutely NO rush now to get into a serious relationship any time soon and am focused on enjoying the last bit of my college years, bettering myself, making lasting platonic connections, maintaining current ones, and furthering my success. When I do become open to love, I will be searching for a HVM as a HVW, and I am looking forward to that chapter too. üíï


So, yeah. 


Moral(s) of the story: 

-NEVER date to fill a void.

-NEVER give someone the opportunity to disrespect you more than once. If they do it once, they WILL do it again, and it will be worse the second time. Don‚Äôt get me started on the third.

-NEVER waste more than a second of your time thinking about a male who hasn‚Äôt spent even one thinking about you.

-NEVER let sex be the binder in any relationship. I should add that this was the first guy I slept with after my ex and because of that, I attempted to latch on to him and wanted it to be more than some random fling. Honestly, I would have maintained more dignity had I just considered the red flags and left it as a one-time thing. 

-ALWAYS be the best version of yourself if you want to attract quality people.


*may make a post later detailing my experience with this guy just because after reading through r/TRP I am literally 100% positive that he follows that mentality + uses their tactics. Like 100%. I would bet LITERALLY all the money in the world, lol. That‚Äôs how positive I am. He‚Äôs a chad &amp;amp;amp;amp; doesn‚Äôt fit the typical demographic but told me he was fat up until a couple years ago so he may have read that shit religiously before his PHYSICAL glo-up. Might be good to hear detail my experience so you all can have extra insight as to what to avoid going forward.*

gzvmsp,Feminist Waves happen when women collectively realize that their individual issues are actually pervasive cultural problems. Men try to prevent this by blaming women for men‚Äôs behavior and pretending like it‚Äôs solely a personal problem.,"If you‚Äôre repeatedly encountering an issue with men, it‚Äôs best to assume most women are too and seek guidance to avoid it or aggressively call men out on it, rather than suffering in silence wondering ‚Äúwhere you went wrong‚Äù or why you‚Äôre ‚Äúattracting the wrong guys‚Äù.

gzs1bn,Men Know They are Meant to Chase. That's Why Slut Shaming is a Thing.,"We all know the double standard that drags women for being promiscuous and praises men for the same. There was a thread a while back in this very sub highlighting the double standard and the lock/key metaphor excuse used by men. For those who missed it: A key that opens multiple locks is a good key. A lock that is opened by multiple keys is a bad lock. The metaphor was sufficiently mocked but it's a good illustration of my point.

It's also said that men's promiscuity requires effort, women's promiscuity requires showing up. Nevermind that women merely having to ""show up"" is a damning example of men's lack of standards in the first place, this is a prime example of men admitting that tradition dictates **they chase the women** and not the other way around.

Women that go after men are seen as desperate and slutty. If he gets you easily, he'll be happy to bed you but will never take you as seriously as a woman he had to chase.

So next time you see a guy wishing women would take more ""initiative,"" take that wish for what it is.

gzmq7j,Level Up- your favorite clothing sources?,"I've decided to carry on with the esteem boost and level up by making some wardrobe adjustments. My current issue is that the going style, at least in the South, is this almost baggy Boho-esque boutique look. Dresses with little shape, baggy even, yet short. On me it is quite unflattering. It feels and looks like a tent. If it isn't this shapeless tent dress, it's a wide leg romper that is equally baggy even in the smallest sizes. I'm also looking for nicer but casual suitable shoe options...to get away from just Birkenstock type slides and sneakers. 

Now, I'm not looking for bodycon dresses and skin tight stuff, but I'd like to have something that is shapely and figure flattering without being trashy. Clothing that actually has a shape off the rack and won't need full reconstruction at a tailor.  I've found one LBD I love from a shop that usually doesn't have shaplier dresses that only needed a little hemming. 

I have a fit, athletic body type with larger than average bust(at least where I live) and proportional hips...but I've also got wider shoulders. These shapeless tent clothes hang off my bust like a tablecloth or curtains and I end up with no defined waist and looking heavier than I am. Anyone else have this issue?

gz0phw,"Friends with twins and witnessed the contrast between LVM/HVM when they started a family. The difference between HVM and LVM during the ""starting a family"" phase is telling. Also: a HVM can be HV without having money, they just need to be generous with their time, effort, and heart.","I have 2 close friends that are twins born 2 minutes apart and have witnessed their journey ""starting a family"" with 2 distinctly different men. Twin A is with a HVM and Twin B is with a LVM. I am friends independently with both twins as separate people (not as a twin unit) so I have witnessed their experience starting a family. Both Twins have mental health issues and needed support with their mental health during pregnancy. Both Twins are dating men that are blue collar/low income. 

Twin A with HVM:

* As soon as Twin A/HVM find out they were accidentally pregnant while dating, Twin A was concerned about having an extremely high deductible on their own plan. HVM was planning on proposing within the year to Twin A anyways (had rings selected to purchase), but pregnancy emphasized that he needed to take action soon since his health insurance was a lot better. Twin A's HVM proposed to Twin A in a thoughtful personal way, purchased a gorgeous but modestly priced engagement ring with a trade-in policy so they could upgrade the ring after they were married for a few years, and the HVM took the money he was saving towards hosting a small engagement party towards building Twin A's dream nursery AND scheduling 2 spa days to pamper Twin A before the baby arrived. 
* The HVM knew that Twin A really wanted family photos and was afraid they would not have money to get the milestones captured that she wanted. He worked overtime for 4 months to make sure he could afford baby photos for Twin A and make sure they had a nice stockpile of formula, diapers, and other supplies before the baby arrived. 
* Twin A was upset that they could only have a small wedding until the baby arrived since they had to get married within the first trimester for health benefits. The HVM reached out to Twin A's best friends and closest family to make sure it could be ""as close"" to a real wedding as they could have in that moment. He got a photographer to take pictures, found a friend that would do Twin A's hair/makeup professionally, got a bridal bouquet custom made for her, and found a family friend that would officiate and another friend to play live music during the ceremony. He reserved a small, classy Italian restaurant for the reception and worked enough overtime to pay for the entire small wedding reception for 25 people.  It's been 5+ years since the wedding and they are planning a vow renewal ""traditional"" wedding in the next few years and the HVM has a separate fund towards making it happen so their kids can be included in the larger wedding now. 
* They had a small, modest baby shower for their first child together. The HVM was not afraid to show his emotions, show off his wife, and was overjoyed with happiness to see Twin A have so many people that loved her/their baby. He shed some tears and hugged EVERY GUEST to personally thank us. 
* When Twin A had their baby, HVM worked 2 double shifts 3X a week to make sure they were able to live comfortably while she was on maternity leave. Despite working 16 hours a day sometimes, he would STILL make it a point to write her romantic notes, send her flowers, and prepare the baby food/baby bullet while Twin A/baby were asleep to make it easier on Twin A. They are on kid #2 and this has NEVER ended and continues to this day.
* When HVM was off work, he would takeover some child-rearing duties when he was back because he knew how hard it is for Twin A to do it 24/7 and wanted her to have time for herself to call her friends, relax, and feel good. Twin A went on a girls vacation with her BFFs and HVM was happily with the children for a full week WITHOUT complaint and coordinated child-care for that week so he could find a sitter/time to self when he was at work. 
* Twin A was struggling with postpartum depression and prepartum depression with pregnancies. HVM was concerned, supported her with every doctor's appointment (requested off work for him to be there because she wanted him present) and increased household duties to make sure Twin A was able to have self-care. 
* I visited Twin A during one of her hard postpartum depression weeks to watch her son and hang with her. HVM cried and hugged me because he was extremely appreciative of all the support Twin A had from her friends to check in. He told me he was so concerned about Twin A and wanted her to see how many people love her because she's his everything. 
* Twin A has a son and HVM models to the son HOW to treat women and why it's important to be a sensitive, emotionally intelligent young man. HVM never reinforces the gender norms young boys should follow and always encourages Twin A's son to speak out for others, show his emotions, etc. 
* Twin A's fingers got swollen during pregnancy #2 so HVM bought Twin A a classy, fashion ring with a lab created gemstone as a placement wedding ring until her fingers were back to normal. No questions asked and he did a great job picking a nice one! 

Twin B with LVM

* Twin B had a surprise pregnancy with LVM and despite talking about marriage abstractly, LVM got defensive and said ""don't put any ideas in her head"" when their family asked about marriage once the baby arrives. 
* Twin B's LVM loves to fish and do outdoorsy shit. Twin B has a bunch of pregnancy stuff that makes being active tough right now. LVM plans ""date nights"" for them to go fishing, BBQ, and do stuff HE WANTS TO DO as a ""date."" 
* Twin B's LVM smokes weed every single day and goes drinking with the boys a few times a month, but doesn't see anything wrong with his behavior while the mother of his child sits alone in his apartment.
* Twin B's LVM only got Twin B flowers on their anniversary and made her breakfast 1 time for mother's day. Twin B always talks about how LVM is ""getting better with money"" but never seems to have money to even do basic adult things. 
* Twin B has shared her prepartum depression struggles with friends and she says LVM tells her it's her ""pregnancy craziness"" to invalidate/downplay her emotions. She said he ""doesn't want to be around her when she's like that"" to condition her to not show emotions in front of him.

gyzxcn,He‚Äôs never going to change for you- The mentality of the LVM,"That LVM you‚Äôre crying over, the one who seemed so sweet in the beginning, the one who promised you things and then lied to you, cheated on you, used you, and turned out to be manipulating you the whole entire time is *never* going to change for you.

After a breakup, we drive ourselves insane over what could have gone wrong? In the beginning, everything was so great! He called everyday, showered you with compliments, took you on dates, asked you to be his girlfriend with no hesitation and then suddenly he changed! Suddenly he‚Äôs distant, moody, even downright cruel sometimes. We give him the benefit of the doubt. We still see all the good in him. We still see the wonderful, loving, attentive man he was in the beginning. So the only logical explanation is it must be something *we‚Äôre* doing wrong, right? We assume we‚Äôre being too needy, too clingy, we have to stop texting him so much, we‚Äôre not attractive enough, we‚Äôre not thin enough, our boobs and ass aren‚Äôt big enough, we‚Äôre not feminine enough, etc. We analyze our every word and behavior and try to figure out how it correlates to this sudden shift in behavior. If we were good enough he would see how lovable we are and step up, right?? We give him space, we try to talk, we tell him how his behavior is hurting us, we suggest ways to help the relationship, we drag him to couple‚Äôs therapy, only to keep repeatedly running into a wall and growing more frustrated and hurt with every attempt. We wonder what the hell happened and ultimately we blame ourselves because we‚Äôve been led to believe that the woman has to inspire the man into love. We grow up watching rom-come where the man fucks up, loses the girl, and then risks it all in a big grand gesture, running to her and falling to his knees to confess his undying love for her and they live happily ever after.

Well, I am here today to tell you ladies that you have all been deceived.

The LVM who suddenly turns into a faithful, committed, mature HVM and the woman who inspired him into love with her magical p*ssy are fictional characters that do not exist in the real world.

This LVM will not regret his behavior. He will not suddenly be inspired to change when he loses you. He may reach out and apologize, say all the words you want to hear, and convince you that he‚Äôs magically become the man of your dreams to get back with you, have sex with you, and make you do all the work you were doing before only to leave you heartbroken again, I *promise* you. In 2 weeks, he will be back to the same porn sick, limp dick, video game addicted, laying around in his underwear smoking weed all day liking Instagram pics of other girls, excuse making, gaslighting, lazy, selfish, narcissistic, egotistical, infuriating manchild he was when you left.

But why? Why can‚Äôt he change for you even when he knows you‚Äôre a bomb, amazing, smart, sexy, well dressed, educated, successful, athletic, beautiful, caring, selfless, intelligent (I could go on) woman? Doesn‚Äôt he *know* you‚Äôre a prize?

Yes, sweetie, he knows. He knows it even more than you do sometimes and when you stick around trying to babysit him he wonders what‚Äôs wrong with you for wasting your time on him.

But yet you haven‚Äôt given up on that man. You will never give up on someone because you believe that everyone has the capability within themselves to change for the better and you‚Äôre absolutely right.

But here‚Äôs the thing...

HE doesn‚Äôt believe in *himself*. Underneath the confident facade and the devil may care attitude there is a very insecure, pathetic, little man.

Think about this: is this man living his dream life right now? Or does he have a job he hates, a long string of failed relationships, very few or no friends, addictions (weed, booze, cocaine, cigarettes, porn, video games, social media, junk food), a small, messy apartment? Did he drop out of college? Does he have a record? Is he unable to keep regular hobbies, build new skills,and set goals for his future?

If yes then ask yourself this: is a nice house not good enough for him? Is a college degree not good enough for him? Is a gym routine not good enough for him? Is a healthy diet not good enough for him? Are close friendships not good enough for him? Is being successful and making a truckload of money every year not good enough for him?!!

NO. He wants ALL of those things. But he is too insecure to be the type of man who goes after what he wants. He is deeply insecure. He‚Äôs so afraid of failure that he rationalizes his lack of effort with excuses and secretly hates that he can‚Äôt just get it together.

He‚Äôs been living this way his entire life. He thinks that everything he wants is too far out of reach for him so why even bother trying? He throws himself a pity party every time he even thinks about doing better and blames everyone around him for why he can‚Äôt succeed. He‚Äôs got mommy issues, daddy issues, and everything about society and the world is set up against him so it‚Äôs not *his* fault for being a failure.

Then, in comes you. He‚Äôs skeptical that you would actually like him, but he wants companionship, sex, validation, and another distraction from his pathetic existence and you seem to like him so he‚Äôll ride it out with you as long as he can. He puts his best foot forward, tries to impress you, and hopes maybe you‚Äôre dumb enough to think he‚Äôs a catch.

After spending some time with you he realizes that you‚Äôre no ‚Äúordinary‚Äù woman however. You‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôre ambitious, you have the world at your fingertips and you‚Äôre going for everything you want and nothing can stop you! Suddenly he‚Äôs reminded of his insecurities. He knows you‚Äôre a prize and he knows you could get snatched up at any moment by someone better than him. He knows you could do better.

Long before you realize that his man has very little to offer you, he‚Äôs realized it himself and he gives up. ‚ÄúWhy bother trying? She‚Äôs just gonna realize what a loser I am. Women only want guys with nice cars and lots of money. The world is so unfair‚Äù

He convinces himself that he will never be able to satisfy you and so he stops trying. The effort no longer feels ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to him because it‚Äôs not gonna work out anyway. Nothing in his life ever works out, why would this be any different? In no time you pick up on this and you‚Äôre out and he gets to be ‚Äúright‚Äù about the futility of it all. This of course isn‚Äôt *his* fault. At the same time a man can realize he‚Äôs a loser, he can also do mental gymnastics to convince himself that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fair‚Äù because he wasn‚Äôt born into a rich family or whatever excuse suits him at the moment. He has to do this for survival because if he admits that being a loser is, in fact, *his* fault he would automatically become responsible for his own behavior and that would mean changing literally everything about himself. 

Ladies, the LVM does not love himself. He does not respect himself. He cannot motivate, validate, or encourage himself. A man cannot give you something he can‚Äôt give himself. No amount of trying, convincing, begging, and pleading will make the man see things from your perspective. He has already decided that the only way to avoid losing is not to play. The more you try, the more insecure he feels for not living up to your expectations. Talking to a LVM about his behavior will have the opposite effect from what you want. When you tell him you see the potential in him, you are reaffirming his deep rooted belief that he will never be good enough and so he acts like an asshole to get you away from him. He doesn‚Äôt want to admit any weaknesses or faults. He wants to carry on in denial and learned helplessness. There is nothing you can do or say to change him. The amount of work it takes to change core beliefs about your abilities as a human being is not impossible, but does require daily effort and consistency-two things he has never been good at.

Accept that his failures are a product of his mentality and it has nothing to do with you. Stop taking things men do personally and realize that we are all autonomous beings with our own decisions to make about our lives and LET HIS SORRY ASS GO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/gyzxcn/hes_never_going_to_change_for_you_the_mentality/,1591625077.0,574,0.98,171,FemaleDatingStrategy,divdec

I'm here because I have a teen daughter and son and the dating world has changed dramatically since I was dating over 20 years ago.  I want to help my daughter date a HVM (if she comes to me for advice) and my son BE a HVM.

I began as a pickmeshia in the 80's but after countless LVM experiences in the 90's, I purchased and used ""The Rules"" book that I see referenced here.  Online dating was just starting but my husband and I were set up by friends of ours.  My husband is a HVM (I think?)  I'm still not exact on what HVM means--he is an excellent father, provider, he's loyal, honest, dedicated to our family, well mannered, respectful of women, doesn't watch porn (yes, really), he's tall and attractive (at least to me), too.  He's not overly romantic but he makes sure to show me he loves me in countless little ways.  Our marriage has had it's ups and downs, we both still had a lot of maturing to do but we have made it and are excited to grow old together.

One thing I have observed is that 20/30 years ago, men had to make an effort to date someone due to lack of technology.  LVM were still around, but too lazy to make the effort which helped weed them out.  Today, technology makes it so easy for LVM to sit on their couches and pretend to be HVM to potential women.

In a sh\*t relationship you could bend over backwards for your partner and just end up tired, upset, guilty and doubting your self worth (oh and you've just wasted 5 years of your life). There is not a magic counter weighing up all the sacrifices you make and noting the promises he's keeping that is going to pay you back in the future. Life is not fair, so only you can look out for yourself. Similarly, there is not added value to a relationship if it's lasted a long time; if it's bad for you, it's just bad.

It's pretty accepted by psychologists that **the** **best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour.**  If he feels LVM now, he'll feel LVM later.

g2m6bq,"The proof is in the pudding, ladies. Don't focus so much on HVM qualities that you miss what's actually important for a LTR/marriage. Here are some examples I've found in my last two relationships, please post yours as well!","Finding a HVM is hard enough. Finding a HVM who actually *loves you* in a deep and meaningful way is even harder. When you find a man who exhibits a lot of HVM qualities, you might be so relieved that you get tunnel vision and forget that you actually need a lot more to sustain a LTR or a marriage. I have noticed some distinct differences in behavior between my current boyfriend (HVM who loves me deeply) and my ex-boyfriend (many HVM qualities, but not in love with me despite saying the words). 

**HIS PHONE**  
* The Ex: Very guarded with his phone, to the point that even his friends would comment on it. Wouldn't even hand me (or anyone) his phone to change the music when we were having a group gathering or something. After a year of dating, I didn't know his phone password. Always took his phone to the bathroom, put it face down, had it on silent, etc. Potential cheating aside, being overly private is a huge red flag.  
* HVM: Phone is always face up, leaves it on the couch when he goes to the bathroom, leaves it in the bed when he gets up to shower in the morning. If he wants to show me something he'll just toss me the phone or hand it to me. Sits right by me and texts/emails openly. Treats his phone like someone with nothing to hide.  

**YOUR STUFF AT HIS PLACE**   
* The Ex: Like Carrie in that episode from SATC, I left a few things at his place once (a few months in) to see if it bothered him. A shirt and some toiletries, nothing huge. Just like Mr. Big, he had everything in a pile for me when I came back the next time. I chewed him out for it and of course he then said it was ""fine"" to leave stuff there. If he doesn't want your stuff in his space when you're not there, he doesn't really want you there. FACTS.  
* HVM: When he noticed I was bringing a travel kit with me every time I came over, he told me to leave it there. He seemed confused about why I hadn't done that already. When he noticed I was using a dinky little travel toothbrush, he pulled out an extra (normal) toothbrush and put it in his toothbrush holder with his. Again, seemed confused about why I hadn't done that already. When I was complaining about having wet hair at his house one day, he said, ""Don't you have a blow dryer here?"" I made a comment about how lots of men would be sketched out by that and his response was that he wanted me to have anything I need to be comfortable at his place. Simple, but huge.  

**""SPACE""**  
* The Ex: Always needed alone time. Would get very worn out by spending several days in a row with me (or with anyone, actually, which is how I convinced myself it wasn't a ""red flag""), even if we weren't doing anything crazy. I should note that we were living about an hour apart for most of our relationship, so we were limited to spending long weekends together. Once we were living in the same city, he would often stay home when I'd go out to see OUR friends, saying he needed some down time. Down time from what?! This led to me using lots of protective behaviors like ""let's do XYZ if you're up for it"" ""let me know if you want to hang out"" etc. Pathetic.  
* HVM: Not clingy, not invasive, respects my space, but it's obvious that he wants to be with me anytime I want to be with him. It's clear that if he's given the choice to do something with me or without me, he'd prefer to have me with him, regardless of what he's doing. I never feel like I'm bothering him with my presence or like I need to go home to GiVE HiM sPAce. It's definitely important to maintain your independence and do things without each other, but you should always feel welcomed around your partner. This is what you need if you're seeking marriage.   

**HARD TIMES**  
* The Ex: When something bad happened or he was undergoing some sort of crisis, he wanted to deal with it on his own. It was obvious that my presence did not make him feel better in any way. There were lots of little things - family drama, issues at work - but the best example is when his grandfather died and he had to fly out for the funeral. I assumed that he'd want me to go with him. We'd been together for a year at that point and had gone on many trips with his parents who totally adored me (and paid for our flights anytime we went somewhere). His brother was bringing his girlfriend so it definitely wouldn't have been strange or inappropriate for him to bring me. He knew I was free that weekend and could have gone, but he just booked his flight and never even discussed it with me.   
* HVM: In just a few months of dating, no family deaths luckily, but he's gotten laid off from his job (due to the pandemic, not performance) and got his car destroyed after being road-raged by a psycho. Both events were extremely upsetting in different ways, but he wanted me by his side after both. It was clear that my presence was warming and calming to him and that he appreciated having me be there for him during a hard time.   

**MONEY**  
* The Ex: Filthy rich but SO weird about his money. He would take me out to nice restaurants, buy me presents (bday and xmas), and all that, but VERY private about his investments, accounts, etc. Also kept cash hidden around his house and got weird when I saw some one day. It was his money and only his, and there was no indication that we'd be merging assets one day. (I should note that he was very much aware that I am not/was not a ""gold digger."" The guy I dated before him was very wealthy too and was madly in love with me, but I walked away, and he was aware of that. I also do just fine on my own as a professional woman.)  
* HVM: Not filthy rich, but does well for himself, and likes to take care of me. Very open about his investments, retirement planning, etc. A small thing that meant a lot: One day I slept at his place and woke up super early, so I went for a walk to get some coffee and breakfast while he slept a little longer. I made a comment later about how I'd left my credit card at my place but luckily was able to use Apple Pay on my phone, and he asked why I hadn't just taken his credit card or some cash from his wallet. Simple as that.  

I could go on for days, y'all. I should note that my ex-boyfriend did a lot of things right and was objectively a ""good"" boyfriend. My friends and family liked him, he had long-term friendships with many HVMs, a good job, lots of hobbies, etc. But at the end of the day, he didn't truly love me and just didn't view me as his partner. I was just a girlfriend and nothing more. My point is to not get wrapped up in HVM v. LVM behavior and forget what you actually need from a HVM. Don't fall into the trap I did - putting on blinders and rationalizing weird behavior because my ex checked most of the boxes. I wasted a very long year of my life. If you're looking for a LTR or marriage, you don't just need someone who has a good job, good hygiene, hobbies, etc. You need a man who is so deeply in love with you that you are a factor in every single thing he does. DON'T FORGET IT.

# I [19M] want to get my ex girlfriend [19F] back and I am willing to do whatever it takes.

üì∑

My ex and I were in a long, loving, and fantastic relationship for nearly 2 years. We broke up Feb 22, and after the break up, a lot of chaos ensued. I do not want to get into many deep details, but the story went a little something like this:

We broke up for the first time in August of 2019. She was drunk texting a friend of hers that he was super hot, and me, being insecure about it, broke up with her on the spot. It was a short lasted break up, we got back together within a week and it was right back to an amazing relationship. She and I never 100% moved on from it though, only 99%.

Flash forward to Feb 22, 2020. My birthday. About a week before this, I had began to have wavering feelings for my girl. I do not know why, but it persisted. I saw she was texting a guy on my birthday, and it was not malicious at all. However, because of my feelings, I broke up with her, but lied and said it was because of the guy. I did not sleep that night, for I knew I had made a grave error. But I wanted more time and space to make SURE that I really loved her and it was not just me being lonely after breaking up. Her form of coping was completely different. She kept texting the guy that was just her friend, and then they started to hangout more. She somewhat rebounded, and within 2 days, she kissed him. For me, I immediately was sent into fight or flight upon realizing this. I became desperate, sad, and needy that I had lost the love of my life. She lied to me, she said she would not be able to move on for months. The next few weeks while we were still at college would be characterized by her going back and forth, loving on me for a few hours and then liking on her new found rebound. Two times in this few week period, she had decided she would stick with me. She agreed that she would go break it off with him, only for him to emotionally manipulate her back into liking him again, saying things like he would be depressed if she did not end up with him or that he felt played.

Keep in mind that this was a close class mate, so it was also a concern to her that she would see him and was afraid that she would not be able to be friends anymore. It became either or, and she was struggling with that. Of course, that was before we knew of the coronavirus's intensity.

She still had plans to come with me to my beach house for spring break, so she did, and the time there was characterized by absolute chaos. One second we were arguing, another we were making love intensely. We cuddled and kissed, all while she texted this guy all day and all night. I kept letting her eat both slices of the cake, because she could not make up her mind and I was loving what I could get.

When we got back from the beach, she face timed the guy and told him that she was already extremely uncomfortable that they had moved at the rate that they did (fellatio and making out) and wanted to slow down. The next day, she had a date with him, so she drove 2 hours to his hometown to go on a date. I found out the next morning, she slept with him. This was a huge hit to my pride, confidence, and made me question everything. She was still saying she loved me at this point, but if she loved me, how could she do this?? These were some of the questions that began to flood my mind. Our plans to go down to campus together that weekend were cancelled. This is when the desperation, neediness, and loneliness began. The next two weeks were characterized by her and I reaching out and always ending at the same conclusion: I was emotionally unattractive through my neediness and desperation, and that time was the only thing that would make things better. It got so bad that she eventually said she did not like me, that we will never get back together, and that she does not even wanna have me in her life anymore, friend or not. I only got more and more desperate and needy, and I pushed her further and further away.

About a week ago, I had a terrible night my neediness. It was perhaps the 6th time that her and I briefly spoke and I fucked up a good ending. I have spent countless hours now reading guides on how to get your ex back and blah blah.

Then, the next morning, she reached out for me to help her on a math question. She then said I was the BEST and that she missed how we use to talk.

There is still hope. I had an online session today with a relationship expert who said my chances are still good. Right now, she is moved on, but she is still sad. She told me she wants to be in love again. Perhaps not with me, but time will prove that maybe she does want to love me again.

My counseling proved to me that I have a chance. 6 days ago, I am started 30 days of absolutely no contact with my ex. There are situations that have proved that my situation is better than most when they win their ex back. I have decided to forgive her and that I do truly want to give it another shot. I am moving on from our past relationship to be confident and construct an even stronger and new one in the future with her.

It has only been 6 days. I am working out to better myself, reading everyday, meditating everyday. I am focusing on myself 100% on no contact.

I want to know, do you think a guy like me still has a chance? I still feel like I do, and I do truly think that everything happens for a reason. Am I delusional, or do you all think that I can still win her back by absence?

At this time, I just want reassurance. There are many details and other things I could get into, but if anyone could provide me with links to stories where it turned out alright, let me know please. Thank you and let me know if you have any advice for me at this time.

g260zd,Preferences vs Requirements,"I've seen the debate within many subs and actually had to unsub from a lot of them due to it. How preferences are ok but requirements are often demonized. And it's often followed by the same ridiculous reasoning which, unironically, they demonized when other minority groups adopt but in a different scenario. 

""Preferences are ok. That means while you prefer one thing, if presented with another, you'd still consider it. Requirements not so much since it leaves people out.""

And my question is, why must I consider every single person within my dating/sex life? I am not for everyone and everyone is not for me. 

If you have any physical requirement of some sort especially height, weight, race, disability/ability or even some non physical requirements such as income, religion, political alignment, higher education etc, you're seen as this bitch. 

""You can't reject someone on things they cannot change.""

Uh yes, yes I can. 

I'm 5'5, I am well aware that men are on average within that range but I truly don't care. Not attracted to men shorter than me at all. Either neck and neck with me and the tallest I see my self dating is 5'9. I also do not date single fathers at all. I am childless and childfree. 

Then here comes the made up scenarios. The what if-ers. 

""What if you fell in love with a man with a child? What if you fell in love with a broke man? No higher education? Short man? Etc..""

...How can I fall in love with someone I just stated I will never want? Besides people need to understand other people do not process emotions the same. Dated my last boyfriend before he sadly passed away for 5 years, took me with two years of dating to feel love, three years to say ""I love you"". He was everything I wanted and more. Emotions don't really manifest fast for me. 

Besides why do total strangers care about the dating requirements of another? Affects you in no way shape or form. 

""You're shortening your dating pool."" 

WE KNOW! Just don't care. I cannot see something as a lost if I never valued it to begin with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g260zd/preferences_vs_requirements/,1587002950.0,122,0.95,22,FemaleDatingStrategy,ohleniishe

g23ka1,Only depraved men insult women and then claim its harmless teasing as a way to show they like you.,"Discovering FDS has been one of the most amazing things to have happened to me. I feel so much happier and content now that I‚Äôve ditched chasing after LVM and following pickmeishah dating advice that devalues women. It‚Äôs also made me see how some of the things a recent LVM I was seeing did was actually abusive. But the old pickmeishah me tried to rationalise it and accept it as normal guy behaviour. I want to share some of the disgusting things this guy said to me so that it will help enlighten other women on how depraved some men really are. 

1. He always insulted my appearance. He would insult my clothes. One time he actually said ‚Äòew gross‚Äô to a coat I was wearing. He insulted how I styled my hair, saying my hair looked like a five year old did it. Whilst I appreciate constructive criticism his words were clearly just plain insulting and I never asked for his opinion on my appearance to begin with. 

2. First time we had sex he complained that my vagina was too small and that he preferred women with big vaginas, whatever the fuck that meant. 

3. He belittled my job, basically calling it unimportant despite the fact that I was earning double the salary he was currently on. 

4. When we were on dates he ignored me and was on his phone for the entirety of the dates. 

5. He had no shame in checking out other women right in front of me and then calling them hot right to my face. 

6. He knew I wasn‚Äôt a very fast walker because of pre-existing medical conditions I had so he would purposely walk very fast so that I would be forced to run to keep up with him. He would then laugh at me because of how slow a walker I was. 

7. He made jokes that I hated food. I suffered from an eating disorder. 

My pickmeishah friends told me that I was overreacting and all his malicious comments were just him teasing me and that‚Äôs how guys show they like a girl. Apparently, to them it didn‚Äôt matter that I would go home crying after he said these hurtful things to me. All this time, I accepted this emotional abuse when I should have said ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô to this guy and block him.

Pickmeishahs who say this are fucked up. Only pre-school boys tease girls when they like them. I want to date a man not some fucking manbaby suffering from Peter Pan Syndrome. When I expressed how these things he said to me hurt me, he would accuse me of being ‚Äòtoo sensitive.‚Äô

Now, learning from this experience anytime a guy tries to start this type of bullying I immediately ditch him. I don‚Äôt care if people think I am too sensitive. A good man will never try to belittle you and find negative things to say when he knows it hurts you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g23ka1/only_depraved_men_insult_women_and_then_claim_its/,1586993908.0,150,0.97,14,FemaleDatingStrategy,EarthFathers

g1yzzp,Being single for years doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unlovable or less worthy,"I originally posted this as a comment in a different thread, but I figured I should share it again in a separate post.

TD;LR: Don‚Äôt put up with bullshit just because you‚Äôve been single for years or your entire life. You are good enough, lovable, and worthy, regardless of your amount of relationship experience.

Here‚Äôs my story:

I never dated or got asked to dances in high school. I had two very good serious relationships in college (for 9 months and two years respectively). In hindsight, they were both LVM because they weren‚Äôt very ambitious and didn‚Äôt take care of their health, but they both treated me very well and we always had fun together.

Then I stayed single for the next five years after graduation, from age 22-27. I‚Äôm now 28. Part of that was because I was busy with work and I had super high standards, but I also got super jealous from seeing my friends and other girls on social media get into what seemed like cute happy relationships with hot guys. I was a hopeless romantic who grew up on fairy tales and rom-coms, so being happily single was a challenge for me. I was equally jealous of the single girls I knew who could pull that off. People would ask me a lot why I‚Äôm single and be shocked that I‚Äôd been single for so long because I‚Äôm a conventionally beautiful tall blonde woman with a fit body, great career, college degree, and friendly personality.

I developed terrible self-esteem and became convinced that I was unlovable and that men only wanted me for sex or casual short-term flings that would end after 1-2 months with no label, while simultaneously rejecting a lot of unattractive guys and obvious LVM right away. Then I met my ex last around this time last year. He seemed like a HVM on paper and he was eager to commit to me after a month, only to become emotionally abusive and very critical of me soon after.

I was so excited just to be in a relationship with someone who was attractive and successful that I ignored a lot of red flags. I desperately latched onto him and seeked his approval because I had a severe lack mindset from having been single for so long before meeting him. I wanted the relationship to work so bad, just so I could prove to myself and others that I could do it.

He dumped me after only five months by writing me a two-page letter describing all the things he thought were ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me and then kicking me out of our shared apartment that I‚Äôd moved into just 48 hours prior. They were mostly tiny random details because he loved to nitpick at me, but he thought I was stupid and inconsiderate for not noticing them. It took me until February/March of this year to recover and we broke up in September. And it was only a five-month relationship! I still get sick to my stomach when I think about the whole experience.

So yeah, don‚Äôt be like me. It‚Äôs OK to be single for a long time, even for five or more years! It‚Äôs OK if you‚Äôve never been in a relationship before. It does not mean something is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with you or that you‚Äôre ‚Äúugly‚Äù or anything like that. You don‚Äôt need validation from men via commitment and a label to confirm that you‚Äôre worthy and special.

But I‚Äôm grateful I learned my lesson the hard way and I wasn‚Äôt with my ex for longer. I no longer feel like a failure who ‚Äúruined‚Äù my relationship by not being perfect. My standards are much higher now and I‚Äôm re-learning that it‚Äôs OK to be my authentic self. FDS, among other things, has helped me a lot with that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g1yzzp/being_single_for_years_doesnt_mean_youre/,1586979253.0,251,0.94,18,FemaleDatingStrategy,venomoth91

He was so crazy manipulative, that when I first said I'm going to break up with him, he performed the whole one-man-play: called me to come to his apartment ""to say goodbye"" which sounded vaguely threatening, put on a suit with perfume and all, had this contrasty dramatic lighting in his room (roommate was gone ‚Äî I bet this douche asked him to leave for stronger isolation effect), wrote a nice ass looking suicide letter with a fancy cursive (which I read later, it mentioned how deeply he loved me, and it's not my fault lol), got a chair and a rope that he hang in the middle of the room, and sat on his bed waiting for me to arrive. 

It was the first time he did that shit, so I started talking him out of it, we yelled, cried, then I was like ""fuck it I'm leaving"" but I didn't actually left the house, just the room, not knowing what the fuck I should do, call the police? So embarrassing.  I hear a loud BAM, run back and see this fucked tied up the rope long enough so he could comfortably rest his feet on the floor, but when I walked in, relaxed his knees and closed his eyes like he was dying. What a fucking clown. I looked at it, and just left the houser and would you know it ‚Äî miracle happened ‚Äî 30 seconds later he runs after me, angry that I left him to suffocate. He would perform a fake suicide one more time, and stopped after I called the police to perform a wellness check. 

I wish I was making shit up. It's so funny now, but back then I was so emotionally drained, angry, pissed, scared that he would actually kill himself, and everyone would think it's my fault. Exactly the things he wanted me to feel. 

I also had another dude who would cut himself in front of me, so that I would feel sorry for him, and I had to fight with him and take the knife away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g1rmyd/has_your_ex_ever_tried_to_commit_fake_suicide/,1586956327.0,178,0.95,48,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

g1ni2f,Men remain in possession of the absolute audacity,"I'm honestly in half amused shock as I'm sharing this. I've been broken up with the father of my 6yo daughter for over two years now due to the fact he was cheating on me the entire time we were together (even while I was in hospital pregnant with a kidney infection, I found all of this out after she was born) and he has made my life as difficult as he possibly can ever since. He basically tries to dictate my time to me based on HIS working schedule, expects everyone around him to rearrange their plans on the shortest notice. Less than a week ago he tried this with me and when I called him out on it, he called me a selfish c*nt, tried to guilt trip me, told me he wasn't giving me any child maintainence etc etc. This is a common occurrence, I've been at my emotional capacity for this dynamic for a while now and due to the extra mental pressure of lockdown have been seriously considering antidepressants. 


Now to the meat of the story. He texted me at 5am this morning (I was on my third nightshift in a row, I work in healthcare) saying this: 'Hey, I've been meaning to ask/run thing by you and had no idea how to word it (mostly because you'd probably laugh in my face). I know half 5 in the morning while you're in work isn't ideal but anyway, I was thinking if while we're in lockdown we could have a no strings attached kind of thing? Like assuming obviously that you're not seeing anyone, and after lockdown we just go back to how we are now or at any time really. I was just thinking it'd make being locked up inside for a few months a bit easier and fun lol. But if you wanna think about it and get back to me later or in a few days that's fine, but if not at all then that's no worries at all either and sorry I know it's inappropriate and all.' I genuinely thought it was a prank, I can't believe how delusional this man could be to assume in any world I'd even consider touching him again. The thought of it repulses me. How he treated me plus the fact he's let himself go over the years and I've blossomed makes it even more ridiculous. 


This man has made my life a living hell, cheated on me, continues to disrespect me, and he assumes I think so little of myself I'd jump at the chance to fake orgasms for him??? I have to laugh.


I guess the moral of this story is don't have a child with a LVM if you can help it. Lord grant me the confidence of a mediocre man.

g1m6fz,"Yes Ladies, You CAN be raped and not realize it until weeks later: A Profile of a Graypist","**A Graypist is a sexual predator who intentionally searches for, lives in, creates, and revels in the ""plausible deniability""  gray area of rape.** They are the kind of men who will intentionally seek out situations where they know women are vulnerable or incapacitated, OR where they believe they can create enough confusion to where the woman is not likely to be believed.

**Graypists are the kinds of men who will scream to the high heavens about women claiming ""regret sex"" is rape after the fact. Yet, interestingly enough, they can never articulate exactly where you gave them consent for any of it, because you didn't.** He just took liberties and assumed whatever he wanted was what you wanted. Assumptions without confirmed consent, is rape.

**Common catch phrases/lies of Graypists:**

*""I was just so drunk I didn't realize what was happening""*

*""I didn't \*mean\* to put it in the wrong hole""*

*""I didn't hear you say ""no""*

*""I thought \[insert outrageously violating sex act they had no prior conversation with you about\] was okay because I've done it with other girls before and they liked it"". (which is likely a lie).*

*""Well you* ***seemed*** *like you wanted it"" (and yet they can never articulate how they came to this conclusion).*

The overwhelming vast majority of women are more likely to blame themselves, believe it to be an accident or a misunderstanding, and believe that the next time won't be like that. We comb through every minuscule detail of the night and try and figure out what we did to communicate to the Graypist that his actions were okay.  **We may be angry, hurt, or even ashamed, but we \*want\* believe in good faith that the Graypist was telling the truth about it being an accident or miscommunication, because most women do not want to think of themselves as a victim,  don't want to navigate the nightmare of the legal system, nor want to deal with the emotional consequences of realizing someone you may have had otherwise friendly feelings for deliberately violated you.**

The thing is, Graypists KNOW what they're doing. They \*know\* all they have to do is ply you with a convenient lie about what happened and what his intentions were and most women will fold. They thrive on the fact that women are socialized to constantly doubt their perceptions of events and physical boundaries. They KNOW it would be massive undertaking for you to go get a rape kit and  navigate the legal system and they're not likely to face consequences.

And we may even continue to communicate with the Graypist on friendly terms, continuing to believe the plausible lie..... UNTIL:

1. You find out from another woman he ""accidentally"" did the same thing to her
2. You have sex with again, and the ""accident"" happens again
3. He blatantly violates other boundaries so deliberately or callously you recognize a pattern
4. You find out through talking with him that it was not an accident
5. You attempt to bring it up and He goes into a narcissistic scrote rage and denies or claims to not remember indisputable facts about what happened or flat out refuses to communicate, period.

**These are all situations in which it is perfectly logical and necessary to report your rapist after the fact, because new information was revealed to you that leads you to credibly believe this was not, in fact, an ""accident"", a misunderstanding, or a one time mistake, but a pattern of deliberate predatory behavior. This is a dangerous criminal who is likely to repeatedly offend.**

Furthermore, The difference between enthusiastic consent and a ""Graype"" is so vast that any man willing to take liberties when you've given him less than that, should be met with high suspicion. Do you think a man who is accustomed to giving women multiple screaming squirting orgasms would ever be confused what a woman in the throes of ecstasy looks like? Not likely.

**The standard is not ""you didn't do enough to stop me"", the standard is enthusiastic consent, and ALWAYS hold them to it.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g1m6fz/yes_ladies_you_can_be_raped_and_not_realize_it/,1586930546.0,412,0.86,50,FemaleDatingStrategy,TheOGJammies

g1j32w,PSA: Stop going on PPD. You have nothing to gain,"Ladies, we have absolutely nothing to gain by even attempting to converse with the men on PPD. The sub leans overwhelmingly red pill and is full of incels, **zeta** males, PUA, and complete misogynists who literally think women should be forced to live under sharia law (yes I have been told in a debate with a PPD redpiller). They will harass you, threaten you, PM racial slurs/attacks and if you push back they will say you can‚Äôt debate without getting emotional. These men have zero interest in legitimately listening to a different side, they just want to use you as a punching bag. They have decided they are the victims and will ignore the reality to fit their own narrative. 

They will ignore the fact that many women admit to finding their partners unattractive, in order to claim women are more ~~evil~~ shallow than men. 

They assume because a woman got off her ass and filed divorce paperwork that she alone is the cause of the demise of the marriage, even if he is cheating or abusive . Because of this, men should not be help legally responsible for financially supporting the children they consented to creating, because the wife chose to divorce him. 

They want women to ‚Äú*love men for who they are*‚Äù but forbid them from leaving under any circumstance, even if he is abusive. (something i have legit been told on PPD)

They will ignore the fact that women perform more housework than men to support their idea that because men work more hours/earn more money, the woman isn‚Äôt bringing  value to the family uint.

They ignore the fact that they can **EASILY** not have children by not having unprotected sex with with random women they don‚Äôt know well.  They do this to support the narrative is men are defenseless victims in family court because of evil women. (I guess this means men would have to take some level of responsibility for their actions, which they will never do because women are the cause of all evil.)

They ignore that prior to modern medicine it was common for women and children to die in child birth, which makes it natural for woman to want a man who will commit, protect and provide because that is essential to her survival. They ignore this to claim women are gold digging leeches who are trying to steal men's resources. 

They claim men only work hard or build societies to attract women (because all women are lazy bitches, not because they needed protection). They claim modern incels who are hostile, violent and refusing to participate in society are doing that because they have no access to women. Then in the next breath will claim an all male society would thrive without women dragging it down. 

They claim if a woman denies her BF/husband anal sex because it causes excruciating pain and bleeding, she still should do it to meet his needs or else you don‚Äôt love truly love him. There are thousands of ~~sex workers~~ pick me‚Äôs ready to support this insanity. 

These are all commonly accepted **FACTS** to the men on PPD/TRP. They leap over logic and contort the facts to create a reason for their **HATRED** for women. Reddit hates FDS but ignores the redpill, PPD, r/ seduction, agegap and other platforms that advise men on how to rape, control, and abuse women under the guise of ‚Äúseduction.‚Äù The existence of FDS shows the jig is up, women are fighting back against to status quo to protect their own happiness. Clearly men who hate you, do not care if you are actually happy. These men do not love women, they hate women. There is no denying this. 

I use to think I could change some people by talking to them on PPD, but obviously this is futile. Ladies going over there is a useless battle that could get you harassed by psychopaths on the internet. Do not waste your energy. In these times don‚Äôt let to boredom get to you. Work on leveling up: do that 3 day juice fast you‚Äôve been thinking of , look up some style ideas to upgrade your wardrobe, try out new hair styles to figure out what frames your face, read some new books, pick up some new hobbies, read the paper and learn about the state of the world.

g16x6x,Can we talk about manners?,"Standard basic manners, I mean. When I was dating post divorce at 40 I met a lot of LVM and learned some hard lessons. Something that surprised me though was the lack of basic manners.

 Gross things like treating burping and farting as a joke and acting like you‚Äôre uptight for not thinking it was hilarious, but things like not looking up from the tv when I would come over for ‚Äúdates‚Äù and keep switching channels, or not introducing me to people and just carrying on a conversation while I stood there trying to think if a ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù way to join the conversation without looking like I was too needy (so sad, I know).

Things that my SO does that are just *basic* things that he learned as a child, my friends gush over. Example: After he met one of my closest friends for the first time, she couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how kind he was. All he did was literally stand up, walk over to her, shake her hand, say he was glad to finally meet her and had heard such great things about her. He‚Äôs been around her plenty since then but if we are around people who don‚Äôt know him she will fall over herself describe this really mundane interaction.
 
Yes, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not rude, but manners are not some test of character - anyone can learn them. I enjoy that he knows how to make people comfortable when meeting them, but that‚Äôs kind of the starting point in a way, you know?

And the sad thing is that if he acted in way that made me break up with him, I know many of my friends would say ‚Äúoh no! He was so nice, give him another chance!‚Äù

g0ygqi,Don't allow yourself to get attached without a 'requirements for my attachment' list.,"The list can just be in your head, but it's best if you write it down. Especially if you're new to FDS and are struggling to not get attached quickly. 

To avoid being exploited and hurt, you need to train yourself to not get attached without basic expectations and requirements being met, screening standards being met. 

For example, a list can be...

\- He doesn't pressure me or coerce me for sex. He is letting me control the pace of intimacy. 

\- Over time, I have observed that he is a decent person, who is responsible, honest, empathetic and knows right from wrong. 

\- We have discussed our goals, values, what we are looking for, if we are compatible or not. 

\- He treats me with respect. He respects my time, energy, efforts. 

\- He is a good communicator-- he listens to me and can also express his own feelings/thoughts. 

\- He is high effort, shows high interest consistently. 

\- etc

This way, you are actually assessing his real character, you're not just imagining things in your head and projecting positive qualities onto him based on superficial actions. Be analytical about it, don't allow emotion to interfere with your screening. Also, train yourself to slowly get attached-- like at first you just like him as a person, you respect him as a person, you think he might have potential, and so on. Don't look at 1 thing he did, and decide that he is trustworthy now and it's safe to get attached. Be vigilant and give yourself time to screen. Most men will show you either their ass or their true colors before 1 month. Others will take a few months longer, but it's rarely ever longer than that. And in this time, also date other men-- don't get attached to one person simply because you're only talking to one person. Men have backup women, so you should do the same. 

Don't do the typical thing-- where you meet some random guy off of an app (and are therefore used to having uncomfortable interactions with random men, unable to use your intuition to screen), have drinks on a low effort date, have sex quickly. That will lead to becoming attached very quickly, you will most likely be exploited, hurt and the cycle will continue-- if you don't change how you approach dating. So this all goes hand-in-hand-- avoid low effort dates, avoid drink dates, avoid dating apps if possible-- these things all lead to premature, dangerous early attachment. 

Your attachment should be hard to earn, it should be a prize for a man who is worthy of your attachment. Sex is the #1 reason why women get attached before they understand a man's true character. Alcohol and loneliness are close seconds. Avoid having sex before thoroughly screening, avoid alcohol and avoid loneliness. Don't let yourself get easily attached to any random Tom, Dick or Butthead. If you've been the type that follows ""chemistry"" and ""sparks"" as your main screening criteria-- learn to undo that conditioning, because you will likely get into a lot of trouble if you're screening primarily through sexual chemistry or sparks. Strengthen your self-preservation instinct, ask yourself, why should a random guy, who I don't even know is a decent person or not, who I don't even know is lying to me or not-- get my attachment? 

More men than not will take advantage of your attachment, always remember that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g0ygqi/dont_allow_yourself_to_get_attached_without_a/,1586836922.0,248,0.97,9,FemaleDatingStrategy,circescircus

Wanting to be with someone who's educated and respects women are just basics!! 

So happy she's sticking to her ground and didn't give in just because being single is shamed upon.

g0ujos,Look out for what he says about your spending,"I want to share something I learnt from my most recent ex and hopefully it helps some of you who might be dating someone who you're not quite sure about.

While it's a red flag for us to date men who cheap out on dates, I'd like to posit that the comments he makes about your expenses are also indicative that he is a LVM.

Something I noted about my ex is that he would always try to get me to buy cheap furniture for my apartment. I had moved in a few months prior to us dating and was furnishing it slowly so to not exhaust my savings or weekly budget. One day while we were out shopping, I found a beautifully handcrafted dining table. It was a little expensive but certainly not entirely out of my furniture budget. He made comments that it was too expensive and not to waste my money.

On a separate occasion, I went looking for bedside tables. He insisted on a $25 flat pack garbage.

After I got my dog, it was the same thing. The pet store was ""too expensive"". My dog is my best friend and she deserves to have some nice things - a collar and leash and a nice bed in particular.

This was a red flag for me for a few reasons:

1. It's my money. I will do what what I want with it. Telling me what to do with it is controlling.
2. It shows a lack of respect for me and my space. I want a nice place and I want nice furniture that will last. 
3. He was lazy and complacent and his outlook on furniture was really just a metaphor for the way he saw our relationship: nice to have but disposable if needed.

I insist on paying my own way for some things because I don't ever want to feel controlled. At the start, I thought he was just looking out for my hip pocket, but it wasn't that at all, nor were my expenses ever any of his business.

The bottom line is not to fall into a trap of re-working things men say to fit a narrative of ""oh he's so nice, he's a HVM and he's looking out for me"". No.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g0ujos/look_out_for_what_he_says_about_your_spending/,1586821698.0,221,0.98,60,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

g0r72q,Case Study: Online Dating vs Women,"**Introduction:** So I decided to dabble into online dating after quitting just to experiment how much different my experience would be after all the newfound wisdom I have collected over the past few years.

**Hypothesis:** I hypothesize that there are great risks in being involved with pathogens, aka, low value men. They will create viruses ranging from mild-severe and only the immune system of a strong willed woman who takes the precautions and correct antibodies will deter them.

**Methodology:** I will conduct an experiment where I test the flow of men's conversations. I will time and calculate how long before men transform a seemingly nice and normal conversation into one with inappropriate, sexual undertones. Upon refusal to take part in these conversation, will these men prove themselves to be pathogens or good bacteria? Stay tuned to find out.

**The Analysis:**

**Case Study 1: He tried to impress me by showing off his motorcycle.**

The Vroom Vroom Virus: 1: I would like to take you on a ride on my motorcycle and then we can go to your place and drink coffee together.

Me:  There are two major issues with that: I don‚Äôt know you well enough to come to my house (we just met an hour ago) and the obvious, COVID-19.

Him: Coming to your house is harmless. I don‚Äôt have any bad intentions. I just want to hang out over coffee.

Me: I can‚Äôt rely on the trust you have of yourself to allow you inside so soon after meeting you. Plus, the rule is, most guys who want to come over so soon have different intentions than to simply chat over coffee and I‚Äôm not going to make you the exception.

Him: You‚Äôre a really rude and mean person.

*Concluding statements: I guess he wasn‚Äôt used to a girl turning him down because the whole ‚ÄúI RiDe a mOtorCyLe‚Äù swooned a lot of na√Øve women in the past. He further insinuated that my ideology was too traditional. Nice try. By the end of the conversation, he stormed off and said, ‚Äúif you still want to talk, you can‚Äù. I guess despite the fact I was ‚Äúrude‚Äù, he found me a challenge and didn‚Äôt want to cut me off completely? Maybe he‚Äôll try winning me over with some other sports vehicle if I decided to stay.*

***Side question:*** *Do men have no fear entering a random stranger‚Äôs house at all or are they fully aware of the privilege they have in knowing that women are not a threat as men are for women?*

**Case Study 2: The Persistent Pathogen**

Asked me a few personal questions. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to share that information so soon. He said that was fine but later, tried to convince me again mid-conversation. I refused so he told me I was an angry, controlling woman. How could I possibly be the controlling one when he‚Äôs trying to guilt trip me into thinking I am angry just to get information out of me that I CLEARLY told him I wasn‚Äôt ready to share yet? He insisted that I was an angry woman. I didn‚Äôt reply so he double texted me saying that angry, feisty women are cute though. Okay, weirdo.

**Case Study 3: We were talking about our travel experiences when he paused to say that he‚Äôs thinking of taking a shower. I said that was fine, he can go ahead. Then he texted me this:**

Moldy pathogen: Can you give me a shower?

Me: I would rather die a thousand times.

Him: \*laughing emoji\* Wow. You would be privileged to.

Me: Ew.

Him: Are you a lesbian?

*Side question: ‚Ä¶so any girl who doesn‚Äôt like you is a lesbian? Got it.*

**Case Study 4:** In the middle of the conversation, he started to incorporate many sexual undertones. I immediately shut those down. He was shocked that I wasn‚Äôt receiving it well because surely I had to be over the moon by his prestigious education degree and wealthy family, right? Nope! His conversations continued to carry sexual undertones when it was clear that I was not interested to partake in this kind of conversation so I sent him a picture of gold garbage.

The Gold-Plated Rubbish Virus: I‚Äôm garbage?

Me: The premium kind.

Him: Has anyone ever slapped you?

Me: No, they wouldn‚Äôt dare.

Him: I would dare.

Me: Try me so I can show you your fate.

Him: I‚Äôm going to sleep.

Me: Do whatever.

Him: I know.

\*2 hours later after not opening his messages. \*

Him: Goodnight.

\*The next day, still haven‚Äôt opened his messages\*

Him: Good morning.

**Conclusion:** According to my observations, my hypothesis was correct. Pathogens are scary, predatory, uncontrollable and will resort to violence if a female has a strong immune system. This study was dangerous to conduct so please don‚Äôt try this at home and I‚Äôm so sorry that women have to go through this shit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g0r72q/case_study_online_dating_vs_women/,1586810555.0,94,0.96,18,FemaleDatingStrategy,Rockymemorylane

g0oj9m,How do you get over being used?,"I find myself being upset at the things I let a past ex do to me, mostly sexually. I feel used and disgusted with the memories even though it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve even heard from him. My roommate just made a maybe too off-colour joke, referencing the sex act and slightly mocking my ex. It wasn‚Äôt meant as a harmful joke, just light ribbing. It just had a really shitty effect where I now find myself sobbing at the memories.
My self worth is not my concern. I have a very healthy mindset now that I‚Äôve had therapy and done research here as well as other online sources. But why does this still haunt me and effect my emotions so much? I feel like a whiner but I‚Äôm tired of continuing to allow this past mistake (meaning the whole boyfriend) continue to tear me apart. Help?  

Edit: Thank you all for your advice and sharing your own experiences. I took all your advice - I sobbed in the shower, I journaled my experience as well as my intentions going forward - but the best thing I found was completely redecorating my room - I bought a new bed, moved everything around, put up new pictures and added a little good vibe corner full of beautiful things - my perfume, my jewellery, my candles, my framed stitch projects, my pictures of cats and dogs that I've known, my prized tchotchke collections, and anything else that brings me happiness.

Hello 28F

My mom is/was a single mom never realized how pick me she was/is until I started reading more about this topic. 

She had a boyfriend for 6 years who she would do wifey things for and he never gave her a ring. I remember one birthday he didn‚Äôt even get her anything. This dude molested me she found out and  SHE STAYED WITH HIM making me feel like I was the one who seduced him and acting like I was her rival (I was 12) 
They finally broke up cause he started cheating with our neighbor who was also her friend for years.

Her next two relationships she ended up being the bread winner cause the two men were losers one of them ended up being her first husband she was around 40. He‚Äôs an alcoholic bum she‚Äôd work, cook, clean while the only thing he did was get drunk and get fired.

g0k7o6,"Boyfriend doesn‚Äôt care that hormonal birth control is causing sex to be painful for girlfriend, not supportive of copper IUD because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to feel the stings‚Äù courtesy of r/birthcontrol","&gt; I‚Äôve (21F) never written a post on reddit, so i wasn‚Äôt sure if this post fell under the category of relationships or birth control, but here goes! I have a long-ish history of failed hormonal birth control (like 4 different types of pills, Nexplanon, etc) and currently I‚Äôm struggling with vaginal dryness and low sex drive due to hormonal birth control pills. I normally have incredibly high sex drive and no problem getting lubricated during sex, so I know that this is a side effect of the pill.

&gt;Additional background regarding my relationship. My boyfriend (26M) is my first official boyfriend and we have been dating for 8 months. He is a fun, interesting person but admittedly he can be a bit selfish in bed. We pretty much have sex more than once a day, and my lack of wetness gives me a lot of anxiety and feelings of inadequacy so I pretty much cannot cum anymore. I mentioned that I want to try the Paraguard (or might even travel to Canada to get the Mona Lisa mini because the paraguard scares the living sh*t out of me!) and was expressing fear about trying out a risky birth control, and my bf told me not to get it because he doesn‚Äôt want to feel the strings. That comment really hurt my feelings, since i struggle with side effects, and have had such trouble during sex that I recently got tears near the opening of my vagina during sex. I feel like he favored his momentary pleasure over how it feels for me to live in my own body? Or my enjoyment during the massive amount of sex that we have? I love him and think he‚Äôs a great person, but I can‚Äôt get over how callous that comment was :( advice?

g0dbcl,A 3 month failed relationship is better than a 3 year failed relationship. Avoid sunk cost fallacy like you avoid coronavirus.,"I think women are trained to believe that the longer you are in a relationship, the more successful your relationship is. 

You can be in a 20 year marriage, but if it's a shitty marriage that was doomed from the start, that just means you wasted 20 years. Staying doesn't get you a medal or prize after X amount of time. 

These days, 1-2 year relationships are considered ""successful"", even when they end, just because the couple stayed together for a couple of years. The standards for measuring relationship success is very, very low. Most of these relationships could have and should have ended at 3-6 months, but a lot of women are brainwashed to believe that they're going to get some prize or reward if they stick around longer. These relationships tend to be very emotionally damaging, and the time it takes to recover from the breakup can be like a mini divorce. People take a surprisingly long time to recover from 1-2 year relationships. So let's say you date someone for 2 years, then take another year to get over it-- you just wasted 3 years of your life. 

You need to be prepared to cut your losses early, since men fully bank on forever girlfriends now, it has become normal. In the past, I think men were pressured by their families and friends to put a ring on it (not like that was a good thing), and now it's become socially acceptable to string along a woman for a decade. So the option of a scrote settling for you due to family pressure/public humiliation, as low as that is, is not really an option anymore. You might be willing to settle for scraps, but the scrote you're with doesn't even want to give you scraps. 

In my opinion, sunk cost fallacy mentality is a big reason why so many women waste their 20s. All you need to do to waste your 20s, to permanently sabotage your future, is to get involved in 2 relationships with LVM banking on sunk cost fallacy. You don't even need to marry them or have their kids, to waste your youth and hurt your future-- just giving them too much of your time and energy can ruin your life. Not that being older is bad, you can still date and do whatever you want, but your 20s provide the most opportunities for relationships, making friends, education, learning skills, etc. Wasting all of that banking on sunk cost fallacy is tragic. 

Don't get brainwashed by the mentality that a failed 2 year relationship is superior to a failed 2 month relationship. The woman who ended things with a LVM at 2 months is far, far better off-- she has invested far less, the guy hasn't broken her down, she can move on easily, recovery from the disappointment of the breakup will take a fraction of the time compared to the woman reeling from the end of a 2 year relationship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g0dbcl/a_3_month_failed_relationship_is_better_than_a_3/,1586758534.0,671,0.97,53,FemaleDatingStrategy,circescircus

g09dmd,I got sick - THIS is why you need a HVM,"I have a dog that I walk around the neighbourhood. I have a neighbor that lives a few blocks away from me and we‚Äôve crossed paths a few times while walking our dogs. I know he‚Äôs sort of into me because he‚Äôs asked me for coffee a few times, but this was a while back when I was in a relationship. We have each other‚Äôs phone numbers because we‚Äôre close as neighbors and because he dog sat for me when I was away. 

Since the virus happened, I‚Äôve been letting my dog run around in the backyard. I give him a proper walk maybe once every day or two to get him (and myself) tired. I therefore haven‚Äôt seen that neighbor in probably months. 

A few weeks ago, the neighbor texts me asking if I wanted to walk our dogs together. I declined and said that I was afraid of the virus and wanted to stay home. This Tuesday he reached out asking again if I wanted to walk the dogs together after work. I‚Äôve been quite lonely since I live alone so I agreed. We went on a walk, met up with another dog walker, and definitely did not keep our distance. 

I wake up the next morning to a fever and a horrible cough. I text him right away. He said that he didn‚Äôt have symptoms so it must be something else. That‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt even sound sorry. 

Ladies, I lay in bed dumbfounded. If one of my neighbors had told me that she was sick in this climate, I would‚Äôve offered to get her medicine, groceries, maybe even bake her something. I ended up asking a friend of mine to get me some medicine and food for the week. 

The neighbor reached out again today asking if I wanted to walk our dogs together tomorrow. No checkup on how I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm not answering and I think I might block him. I find it quite rude that he KNEW I was afraid of getting sick, then acted like it was nothing serious when I did get sick. This isn‚Äôt even being HV or not, this is being a good neighbor and maintaining a friendly relationship. I‚Äôm pissed off.


ETA: I am aware that this is my own fault. I never said it wasn‚Äôt. I just expected a human response to getting sick - him to wish me to get better, at least offer to bring by medicine since we live close. I hope others can learn from this post.

g09d0h,Why are people so weirded out by the idea of celibacy?,"I told a friend I wasn‚Äôt gonna date a man who watches porn, and the conversation went on to her saying ‚ÄúBut all of them watch porn. So what are you gonna do in that case? Date nobody?‚Äù 
Well yeah, nobody.

I was talking to a guy, and he said ‚Äúmost men don‚Äôt do all the effort that I do to please a woman in bed‚Äù, and when I told him I wouldn‚Äôt date a man who doesn‚Äôt care about my pleasure, he was talking with a tone as if he was surprised or didn‚Äôt believe that I wouldn‚Äôt consider a man who doesn‚Äôt put his attention on my pleasure as much as I put mine on his.

It‚Äôs like the general idea is; ‚Äúsettling for less is better than being celibate‚Äù , it‚Äôs like most people truly don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre serious about being celibate if your dream partner doesn‚Äôt exist.

Why? Why would I want to be trapped with somebody I‚Äôm settling for? That wouldn‚Äôt be respectful to him, it wouldn‚Äôt be respectful to me. The latter in the first place, my needs are important.

Why would I be together with someone who watches porn? With somebody who gets off to female exploitation on camera? I don‚Äôt need a beast with no morals. I‚Äôm not interested in that. I‚Äôm interested in a compassionate man who is affectionate and respects me, and respects women in general enough to not watch porn. I‚Äôd rather be single that with somebody who watches porn. If that disqualifies majority of men, that is fine. I‚Äôm not begging anyone to be with me. My standards are important to me.

Why would I want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt find my pleasure important? Somebody who isn‚Äôt considerate of my feelings? Somebody who is misogynistic? Somebody who learns sex from porn? Somebody who is manipulative? Somebody who doesn‚Äôt respect my boundaries? Somebody who isn‚Äôt affectionate and sweet like I imagine my dream partner to be? Fuck yes I‚Äôd rather be alone. If most men truly are polygamous cumbrains who want to have sex with other women as well like the manospherian alfalfas say, and actually all want to have a threesome.... why would I bother myself with such a creature? 

I don‚Äôt believe they all are, obviously. I believe in love and good men. But if they were all like that, why bother? I don‚Äôt want a beast who is a slave to his biology. I‚Äôm not like that, I don‚Äôt want a partner who is like that. That is fair. If most men are porn addicts and walking stress givers like I see so many of my girl friends and women on the internet ranting about... why would I want to spend my energy on such a creature? I don‚Äôt need a creature like that take away years from my life because he‚Äôs stressing me out. 

Women nowadays are expected to cater to their partners and all their needs. Women are expected to go out of their way to prove their worth to their partner, do majority of the child care even if they work as much as their partners do. Women are expected to be both the cool girl and the trad wife. Expected to be cool with their partner watching porn and deal with everything that comes with it, from porn based sex to limp dicks to dead bedrooms. The expectations for women nowadays are way higher than for men. Both in how they look as in how they act. 

Being celibate forever doesn‚Äôt induce any negative emotions in me because fuck that noise. I don‚Äôt feel like catering to anyone and accepting less than I want. And I don‚Äôt really need sex. Plus I‚Äôm not interested in having children even if I meet my Nigel. I don‚Äôt mind being alone, so I just shrug at the idea of being celibate forever. It would be cool to meet a man who is worth it, and I‚Äôd be happy if I met him, but otherwise yawn, couldn‚Äôt care less. Single &amp; childless women are the happiest demographic anyways cuz they have way less stress and responsibilities flung at them.

My expectations aren‚Äôt even that high, just treat me with respect, put in effort, and don‚Äôt watch porn. Don‚Äôt just slap my ass and buy me pizza.

g07ybx,"Since joining FDS, I will no longer tolerate ‚Äúrough sex‚Äù","I (28F) had a lot of bad sex during my early and mid-20s. I was very much a ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù and pick-me who allowed many LVM to put me in awful physical pain and discomfort during sex and I would do things I thought were absolutely disgusting like swallowing cum and letting them cum on my face. Or I would force myself to last longer so they wouldn‚Äôt have to finish on their own, even though my vagina was sore and I wanted to quit. I felt bad saying no or asking them to stop because I didn‚Äôt want to be a disappointment and I thought there was something wrong with me because apparently other girls could last longer and they liked doing that stuff. I thought being a ‚Äúkinky freak‚Äù who could last for hours was the norm nowadays and I was ‚Äútoo boring‚Äù for wanting to keep things gentle and vanilla and and too weak for getting sore after 10 minutes on average.

Now whenever a guy I‚Äôm dating tells me he likes rough sex or that he lasts for hours, I lose interest so fast. I think back to all the bad sexual experiences I had when I was younger and how I have no desire to repeat them. I falsely assumed all men would insist on wanting to do things like anal and having me swallow and I had to just tolerate it in order to keep them interested. And I was afraid to speak up because I didn‚Äôt want to offend them.

But nope, not anymore. If a man needs me to be in pain or do something disgusting or degrading in order to get off, I‚Äôm just going to leave. It‚Äôs time for me to stand up for myself and no longer tolerate bad sex with selfish men.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g07ybx/since_joining_fds_i_will_no_longer_tolerate_rough/,1586736963.0,461,0.96,36,FemaleDatingStrategy,venomoth91

g05u19,Pickmeshas fear their own standards.,"I was speaking to a friend the other day who tends to be very pickme in her dating behavior. She takes what she gets and she filters her validation through men. Unfortunately she's been through a lot so I try to help, albeit from a distance.

I tried to tell her why standards and boundaries were so important and she went on to claim that setting such standards would mean closing her off to the ""other potential good things about a person she may not know she likes yet"". Which like. Yes. But you can find them in people who DO have things you ALREADY KNOW YOU LIKE. The rest can be bonus.

The other thing I've noticed is their fear that their standards are too much and nice to think about but not practically applicable. And that's the harder thing to get them to accept. That it's better to never find anyone who matches your requirements than to give up and settle. They go into every relationship thinking ""I won't get what I really want anyway so I'll take what I get.""

Which is so sad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/g05u19/pickmeshas_fear_their_own_standards/,1586729058.0,135,0.97,11,FemaleDatingStrategy,babysteps65

But a woman was only ever on dating terms with her ex, how is it possible that he took so much time from her? Did she truly spend every single hour of her day with him?

No matter what he's like, never stop working on your personal goals, creating and maintaining your friendships, and striving to become the best person you can possibly be. Even if he is a HVM and the most wonderful, loyal and committed man you could ever hope for, investing in him at the expense of the relationship you have with yourself is poor judgement.

**HOW HE TREATS YOU IS HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU**

If he lets the relationship die, doesn't consider how you feel, can't engage with you about things that are important to you then walk away and block and delete him. Do not give your choice a second thought.

Do not be a pickmeisha like I just was and think that just because you got some LVM male to agree to be in a relationship with you makes it any different. Yes, like me you may have not been in a relationship for years. Yes, like me, you may have thought he cared about you but how he is treating you *right now* is a reflection on how he feels about you.

If you call, if you beg, if you coach, they will not change. Men who have to be asked to compromise will not compromise and furthermore aren't ready for a relationship.

Men are operating the same way, I can promise you that.

For example - 

If he purposefully gives you the silent treatment and you beg him to talk to you, who do you think is getting the blame for that situation? You! For not ""respecting his space"".

fzu2jy,"Low value behaviour from men is 100% intentional, they know what they're doing","Saw this on relationship advice, seems to be a common situation from women posters. They describe their partner as great and loving apart from this one issue, which is always intentional disrespect. They always ask their partner to stop doing said issue but the man always continues. When called out, its always 'it's a joke', 'it was an accident', or 'I didn't realise you minded'. These are all lies; it is 100% manipulation and a test to see how far the man can get away with disrespecting his partner. It's a power trip. Something like this wouldn't even occur to a man who respects you, and even if it did he would stop the minute you told him it hurt your feelings. Stop giving them chances when they're continually disrespecting you straight to your face!!

fxejrk,"Being a Kinkmeisha traumatized me, but now I‚Äôm recovering!","Hello all. I am new to FDS and just want to say thank you for your posts they have awakened me in a way I never thought was possible. 

I am 21 years old, and feel that I‚Äôve spent my whole young life forcing myself to adopt a ‚Äúsex-positive‚Äù, and ‚Äúcool kinky girl‚Äù persona. I recently got out of a relationship with a 34 year old man who would constantly push the boundaries of my kinks until we were doing things I would never dream of.

I spent my teen years online watching porn and talking to older men who groomed me because I was desperate for acceptance. I used to embrace being a ‚Äúslut‚Äù cause I wanted so badly to be wanted by men. My true awakening came when after being choked in bed, I developed broken blood vessels all over my face called ‚Äúpetechia‚Äù, indicating that I was close to dying...

I‚Äôve suffered bruises, humiliation and other ‚Äúkinky‚Äù things because I thought it was the only way to keep a man interested in me.. to be so extreme that they would have to stay with me. I think lots of girls my age get sucked into the ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù kinks and dating older men.. but liberal feminism says this is empowering? 

I can‚Äôt feel turned on anymore without feeling the embarrassment of what I let these men do to me. I am in completely new territory trying to talk to men without exposing myself completely within moments. It‚Äôs hard but I know it will get better.. there‚Äôs no turning back and it‚Äôs because of FDS.

I‚Äôm not perfect now and I‚Äôm still struggling with my old tendencies, but realizing the abuse I‚Äôve put myself through in the name of wanting to be loved made me feel sick.

ejy1ad,What was your worst pickmeisha experience like with a LV ex?,"I was living my queen life with so much confidence and drive and ""I'm doing me"" behavior and attitude. I thought I had left my pickmeisha behavior in the past when I ditched some toxic gal friends and swore off dating for a little over a year. I thought I grew so much spiritually, mentally and in my education and was ready to take on life's challenges and continue my winning streak with CONFIDENCE, HIGH STANDARDS AND HIGH SELF-ESTEEM. That's right when I got back out there in the dating pool and put all my eggs in one basket  for a fixer upper, LV, narcissistic, emotionally and potentially physically abusive man.  And let me tell you, you shoulda called me Joanna fucking Gaines the way I  was trying to put all the shiplap on that fucking relationship y'all. Trying to fix it, flip it, gut it and put in new hardwood, all of that!

First of all, I told him every single thing I was looking for in a man! EVERY THING! He of course pretended to be those things for nearly a year. Even within that year there was so much, SO MUCH that I ignored and made excuses for in my head. I thought I had been chosen by a sensitive man who just had some trouble times with his mom and that he was misunderstood by everyone around him. I thought that when he told me that his ex gf accused him of being abusive that she had a right to feel what she felt but when he began doubling down on the fact that he wasn't by giving examples of how he in fact was, I rearranged my LOUD SOUNDING RED FLAG ALARMS to low muffled sounds and told myself she was/must have been overexaggerating. 90% of our dates were walks in the park or through the city. Y'all I had to eventually start wearing sneakers just to stay comfortable for all the walking we did. DINNER OR LUNCH? DUTCH OR I PAID IN FULL. When we stayed at bed &amp; breakfast establishments we went DUTCH or I PAYED FOR THEM IN FULL. I PAID IN FULL FOR A BED &amp; BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR MY OWN BIRTHDAY Y'ALL! All the women friends he had that he wouldn't tell me much about? It was fine I wasn't the type to be a jealous bitch, lol what foolishness was that!! Y'all he'd visit his female friends and not tell me, take his phone in the bathroom ALWAYS and talk shit and or praise some of these same female friends. He was either using them or clearly wanted to fuck them. He expressed countless times that sometimes he still had urges from his 'old ways' I desperately pleaded that he either leave or decide he wants commitment INSTEAD OF JUST DUMPING HIS ASS FROM JUMP! He on more than one occasion said to me ""I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I LIKE YOU FOR YOU OR IF ITS THE FACT THAT YOU STROKE MY EGO"" I laughed this off y'all! He showed me who he was and even covertly warned me PLENTY OF TIMES. BUT MY PICK ME ASS WANTED TO FEEL LOVED AND WANTED THAT  I THREW AWAY ALL OF MY VALUES, STANDARDS, SELF- RESPECT AND SO MUCH MORE  AND SETTLED FOR A CRUSTY ASPIRING ENTERTAINER WHO SLEPT IN A DIRTY SMELLY ROOM ON THE FLOOR IN HIS MAMA'S HOUSE. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lowered my standards for 2 years because I thought the breadcrumbs he was giving me was love. You know the love that you're supposed to ""make work"" aka settle for because you don't think you can do any better. I put my emotional health, sexual h ealth, physical health, financial wealth, time, energy, and being at risk for a broke man with a pipe dream who emotionally and mentally abused me, with the potential of physical abuse cuz I wanted to get chose. Also this was my FIRST ADULT RELATIONSHIP.

ejvej7,Hypergamy hysteria debunked,"You've all probably heard of the 80/20 rule, according to which 80% of women only want top 20% of men. 

The only official study I've seen them use to back this up were graphs from okcupid in which women judge male attractiveness levels harshly (mostly finding only a minority of men hot) while men's estimate of women's attractiveness is more balanced. 

However, in the true manosphere spirit, they leave out a piece of information that debunks it - messaging patterns! *Men message mostly the most attractive women, while women are messaging the less attractive guys too.*

o1235n,Bullied for being a FDS-er. How do you react to this ?,"So I have a female at work that used to be pretty close to me. She was the one that bought me into the company. We're a sub-team of 3, us and a man.  Exactly because we're close friends I tend to confide to her. Recently, I've made a lover that is *(or so it seems to be)* a HVM. This main takes care of me, makes me breakfast for work, buys me  expensive jewelry, we go to mall,  in a word he spoils me. And she sees new rings or things and I do not lie, I tell her that it's from my boyfriend.

Few days ago, the male co-worker (that is also astrology) told me some things about my relationship, like the thing that I need to learn to believe that I deserve all the good things that come from the relationship and I said that ""Yeah, he really helps me believing this by treating me like a princess"" (God forbid to say queen, I think she would have exploded) to which she stepped into the conversation and said with a pretty high voice that she for example doesn't like to be to be maintained by a man and she thinks is a wrong thing to do. To which I responded that I'm not maintained, considering that I DO work, just like her and I think it's nothing wrong for the man to show you in different ways that he loves you. After all, I didn't ask him for anything. All the things came naturally from him. That was one thing. I let it pass. I tough even if we don't have the same principles, we can still be friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't remember how it's started but she was singing with my other co-worker ""Daddy cool"" ( subtly looking at me). I was too focused on what I was doing, to give her attention, but this sticks with me. Of course I was annoyed. Or course she was asking me the next day if I'm annoyed at her. Of course...I didn't tell her. I just told her it's nothing. But I cannot still befriend her considering this.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you respond to this? I'm sure she will continue with the ""subtleties"".

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Girls, help. I feel she is almost crying because I've became cold to her.

o10s8d,"REMINDER: FDS is NOT WGTOW/OVARIT/FEMCEL etc, We're a Dating Strategy....So You Should, Ya'Know, DATE.","As the (probably) last female-only space on Reddit, there is creeping pressure from other adjacent female-led groups who were yeeted from Reddit for this space to be all things to all women.  I want to remind everyone that Female Dating Strategy is specifically a sub about dating.

It's okay to take breaks from dating because you're in a negative mindset, or focus on self improvement, or determine what you even want ...but staying perched on FDS saying you're never going to date or complaining about beauty standards and lookism is counterproductive.  FDS is striving for improvement on individual relationship quality as well as cultural change, that requires self accountability and action. Yes you should \*prepare\* for the possibility to be alone, but things won't change if you refuse to play the game. And an [overemphasis on looks could be sabotaging you from finding a healthy relationship.](https://www.thefemaledatingstrategy.com/post/do-looks-matter-for-attracting-a-high-value-man-why-doesn-t-fds-focus-on-improving-external-beauty)

If you're more interested in cultivating solitude as a permanent lifestyle choice and opting out of dating, WGTOW might be the sub closer to your goals.

It's not to say dating is going to be totally a breeze, but if we're doing things right here, our users should hopefully be cultivating a supportive girl gang and a mindset of self advocacy and techniques for boundary setting that will serve them well in finding quality, highly valuable relationships and experiencing far less trash behavior from men. It should \*feel\* substantially easier after practice.

Our primary focus is on creating strategies to improve the dating experience, relationship quality, and overall sexual existence of straight women. This is done on both a micro and macro scale by 1) developing a concrete list of vetting techniques for individual women to employ, 2) pushing back/dismantling cultural narratives, legal and social practices, and political agendas pushed by the media, the manosphere, conservatives, and some branches of feminism that we think are actively harmful to this goal and 3) creating new narratives and ideas more in line with our actual desires.

Sometimes this overlaps with ideas present in Radical feminism. Sometimes it doesn't. We're a relationship strategy for straight women, not a place for idealogical grandstanding. Some of the users who are trying to co-opt this into a completely radfem space seem to have missed that memo (hence the uproar of FAF Fridays, gender norms, posting certain instagram stars etc). 

We're setting boundaries on when/where/how we \*choose\* to be sexually engaged by men, and will always attack the commodification, grooming, and abuse of women via the sex industry (and the expectation that non-SWers tolerate this), but it's not a free for all to attack women who are attractive or self-sexualized in any way. Attack the dehumanizing and problematic \*themes\* of sexual objectification, not the people. 

In this vein, We're not being ""hypocritical"" or ""dehumanizing"" to men with FAF Fridays, or by demanding they be sexually attractive to us ‚Äîwe‚Äôre just breaking through stupid male pandering media narratives about how middle aged doughy soft bodied small peen emotionally needy men are somehow the pinnacle of male sex appeal.  There's a lot more to be said about this, but the general idea is FDS is taking the focus off endless sexualization of women's bodies and pointing the spotlight back at men for once. Why? Because women have just as much of a right to demand compliance to our sexual and relationship standards, but every other outlet besides this one shames us for having them. For example,[PEEN SIZE MATTERS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/in5dh7/im_declaring_our_right_as_women_to_have_specific/) AND I WILL [NEVER FUCKING APOLOGIZE FOR THIS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/iv2pqb/i_did_a_post_on_my_personal_penis_preferences_and/). 

Having and expressing discerning standards IS part of our strategy, and so is active dating. So go out and have fun this summer and please update us on your scrotations and successes!!

**ETA: I want to be clear that we explicitly recommended multi-dating - that‚Äôs in the handbook.**

**The users who are passively ‚Äúwaiting for a HVM to come along‚Äù are missing a part of FDS. This is where I think the sub has gotten off track and gotten too WGTOWish.**

**Waiting around for a HVM to fall in your lap is not a great strategy and explicitly leaves you more vulnerable to loneliness or manipulation from lack of comparison or options. The idea is to get in the habit of curating new experiences with men and dropping as soon as red flags appear so your dating experience is a net positive. You have to fine tune your picker and actually engage the culture to change the culture.**

**Queen energy is about taking control of curating your life in a positive direction. Setting boundaries, identifying your needs and wants,  articulating your needs and wants, vetting men - these are skills to cultivate through experience.**

**Men learn through consequence, Rejection, and failure. You should get comfortable with meeting and rejecting men, not just avoiding them.  Setting boundaries is a skill set that needs building up.**

We never talked about sexual issues and I can't think of anything that made me think he had ulterior motives to talk to me. I feel betrayed because I used to consider him a friend with whom I could be myself and with whom I could share my thoughts and problems, in particular about my love life.
He said sorry and said he doesn't know what happened with him, that probably he was confused and his self-esteem was low. Ugh.
I told another friend because I was shocked and he replied ""well, those things just happen, how many times have you heard of a woman who has showed her boobs because she felt confuse and then regretted it?"" 
Actually never. Lmao the opposite actually, this would be a dream for most male pigs. So basically he replied that it was no big deal, like if it was normal.

This is a good step, don't get me wrong. However, suddenly blogging quotes about uplifting things, and leaving some nice words to women you once suicide baited or threatened with rape is not going to fix your atrocious behaviour. 

It takes approximately [five years](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/how-to-get-someone-out-of-a-cult.html) to unlearn a lot of the cult behaviour and habits you've been exposed to. So whether you like it or not, you're still going to be ruinous for women and minorities whether you admit it or not. By extension I avoid most women who are still fresh out of the trad/RP/NS/any right wing movement because they still have insane amounts of work to do and pickmedom to unlearn. 

Most importantly, we don't have to forgive you and it's your job to actually do the footwork to be better.

o0w6bd,Creepy trait about LVX I just realized‚Ä¶,"So my LVX was a 40 year old loser, accidental baby daddy with no ambition and no drive whatsoever. Literally smoked weed all day, every day when he didn‚Äôt have his kid. I consider him one of my biggest embarrassments and mistakes but I had just come off of two years of celibacy and singledom and probably was still very vulnerable and not in the best place/easily manipulated. Thankfully the situation lasted only a few months before I got the eff out of dodge.

Anyways, I have been thinking back and I remember I noticed something off about him: he would tell all of his female family members‚Äô business to me. He told me about how his mom (before she got with his dad/her ex-husband) got pregnant with a doctor‚Äôs baby and gave him up for adoption. He told me how his older sister slept with all of his friends. He told me how his niece was a virgin but had gone to the OBGYN for birth control recently because she got her first serious boyfriend and his mom had called and told him that (using less than ‚Äúdelicate‚Äù language). He seemed more weirded out by his mom‚Äôs phraseology than the fact that he knew and was ok with sharing with me (a total stranger to that girl) that his 20 year old niece was a virgin. 

I told him at the time I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him telling me all of this and really it was disrespectful to not keep the confidence of the women in his life (and also that it was creepy he would know that about his niece) and he shrugged it off like ‚Äúmeh we don‚Äôt have boundaries‚Äù. Made me realize I really couldn‚Äôt trust him if his own mother, sister, and niece couldn‚Äôt either. It‚Äôs true what a lot of the ladies on here say, pay attention to the respect they give or don‚Äôt give to the women in their families. 

P.S. along those lines I overheard him speaking to his mother on the phone a couple of times and he was so condescending and spoke to her like she was a child. He would get off the phone like he was such a big man and be like ‚Äúwell I told her this is how she needs to deal with the situation‚Äù. Again, total lack of respect. The woman was a whole nurse and managed to raise his and his sister‚Äôs grown asses without his guidance, so the audacity and arrogance was really too much. üö©üö©",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0w6bd/creepy_trait_about_lvx_i_just_realized/,1623815996.0,198,0.94,12,FemaleDatingStrategy,IndigoTR

My list of requirements isn‚Äôt overly long, I‚Äôm realistic about what I‚Äôll get in my price range, and I‚Äôm paying cash. Unfortunately, there seems to be this stigma about single women with no children having nice things. 

A few weeks ago, I put in a cash offer 10% above listing price on a house. My offer wasn‚Äôt accepted according to my realtor because another couple sent the homeowner a letter about how much they loved the home and how their children would love growing up there. The homeowner literally left money on the table to accept that offer. (I don‚Äôt know how these letters that people are sending are legal.) When I pressed the realtor for more details, she suggested driving someone else‚Äôs car and dressing down when I go to look at a house, so I could look more relatable. Mind you, this was not a starter home or a fixer upper. 

My realtor called me a few days ago with an address to a ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù. When I pulled up to the driveway, I couldn‚Äôt believe that she wanted to show it to me. It was 1/3 of my budget and less than 1000 square feet. When I asked her why she was showing me this house, she said, ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs just you and this is the perfect size for one person‚Äù. So because I‚Äôm single, I should be relegated to a house with no garage and a kitchen the size of a shoe box? 

Apparently in this housing market, the nice homes with a few bedrooms, room to park a car, and a yard are reserved for those who have married and procreated and the spinsters can just become little old ladies who live in their shoes. 

I‚Äôll be looking for a new realtor, but in the meantime, please share your stories of buying your dream houses on your own.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0ud2t/apparently_single_women_cant_have_nice_things_aka/,1623809643.0,1141,0.93,193,FemaleDatingStrategy,Muffy217

o0ofv3,"Why do other women get so angry at us? Because patriarchy is a religion, and we are heretics.","[Adapted from my comment on this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0k7zr/im_beginning_to_think_all_dating_subreddits_here/h1vnjg9/) 

Growing up as a woman basically brainwashes you to measure your own value by how much you appeal to men. Pick-mes, kinksters, the Empowered Sex Worker Brigade, all the women who get so angry at us - they think they're appealing to men, therefore they are more valuable. But why? 

Women are groomed to self-police other women who don't ""woman"" (verb) right. We learn it from our mother, the first woman who polices us into being a woman correctly. Remember being a teenager? Remember the way your peers would brutally bully tomboys, lesbians, late bloomers, virgins, etc? Perhaps you even did it. Or perhaps you were the victim of it.

But why do we do this? It's part competition and part cognitive dissonance. We do this because patriarchy is a religion, and we have all been raised in it since birth.

We police other women to signal our own devotion to Being The Right Kind Of Woman, the way a religious person denounces a sinner. This elevates our own status. Men don't like women who don't appeal to them, so if we align with men against them, perhaps men will value us more. You could call it performative virtue-signaling, but it doesn't really matter if men see it. We've internalized the male perspective, the male interest, so much, we can perform for a man who isn't even there. And so have all the women around us. 

Second - although this is a bit less conscious - we think this is an act of tough love. We don't necessarily see it as bullying. We see it as teaching other women that they need to get their act together, for their own sake. After all, if they don't appeal to men, what kind of value will they have?

The modern woman couches this in terms of ""feminism"" and ""empowerment"" and ""sex positivity."" They see themselves as standing in rebellion to traditional patriarchal morals of modesty and purity and ignore the fact that they're just adhering to a different set of patriarchal values. That's where the cognitive dissonance comes in. People don't like being confronted with ideas that challenge their concept of who they are and how the world works. And people get like this about everything. (Try telling a stoner that smoking three blunts a day is actually not good for his lungs.) 

Moreover, the heretic is worse than the nonbeliever. And every woman is a heretic, because being male-aligned is the default. That's what we were raised into. You have to make the conscious choice not to be male-aligned, and you can compare it to leaving a religion.

Think about how religious people respond to heretics and apostates. That's how male-aligned women see women like us. To them, everything we say carries the implicit message of, *""Everything you believe about yourself, your relationships, and your sexuality is wrong and I'm judging you for it.""* (I'd say this is projection, but yeah, we are judging them.) So they get defensive and angry. It's perfectly understandable. It's also kind of pathetic. Because if you're actually secure in your beliefs/life/self, judgment doesn't bother you. But they're not. They're very insecure, because being male-aligned requires and reinforces that insecurity. So any threat to the fragile mental defenses they've built up around this male-aligned sense of self must be responded to harshly.


Any women out here who have left restrictive religions, you know what I mean. Under patriarchy, man is god. We have decided that men are *not* god, actually, and we have better things to do with our lives than please them. We're heretics and apostates. That's why they hate us. That's why they respond so aggressively to the things we say. That's why friends drop us when we uphold these standards and live by these values. That's why they tell us we're too picky, too stuck-up, too snobby, our standards are too high, we're toxic, we're bigoted.... we're sinners. It's not just competition. If it was, they'd be happy to let us lose their little competition for male approval. It's that we're not even playing the game. By not playing the game, we introduce the idea that maybe the game is stupid and not worth playing. And they can't have that. Because their entire sense of self-worth is wrapped up in the game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0ofv3/why_do_other_women_get_so_angry_at_us_because/,1623790753.0,731,0.91,59,FemaleDatingStrategy,MelatoninNightmares

Someone actually had to point out to the OP that dating strategies for women are different than strategies for men. 

We may not talk about how to pick up men for one-night stands, but we are still talking dating strategy. These men have *zero* empathy and can't even fathom that women's dating concerns would be about staying safe and avoiding men who waste our time.

Lots of STI-infested matches who want to meet in a field for no-strings sex, sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0mxfl/dating_strategies_are_different_for_men_vs_women/,1623786531.0,742,0.93,76,FemaleDatingStrategy,ShamblingTriangles
o0k7zr,I‚Äôm beginning to think all dating subreddits here are anti-woman to some extent,"UPDATE! I was banned. Last post was ‚Äústay safe‚Äù to a female who engaged in risky promiscuous sex.

UPDATE #2: Someone posted me to the red pill sub! Needless to say my inbox is comedy gold atm.

 On a post on a subreddit about dating over a certain age, kink and other non-vanilla sex came up. I pointed out how risky some of these behaviors and sexual acts are, only to be met by comments by ‚Äúpickme‚Äù women accusing me of kink shaming and not being sex positive. A mod even deleted a comment because I said, ‚Äúa man expecting anal from a woman is emotionally damaging‚Äù. I also linked articles to how risky this type of sex is, only to be torn apart for using STD rather than STI as an acronym. Apparently it is ‚Äúout of date‚Äù. 

Now, I don‚Äôt want to blame these types of women for men‚Äôs horrendous treatment of women. However I feel these types of ‚Äúfeminists‚Äù make certain types of power dynamics sex acts, such as Dom/sub, Daddy/daughter, hardcore bondage and rough anal sex, hitting and slapping, something men are entirely entitled to and if a woman isn‚Äôt into that, he will push her boundaries, compare her to other women to pressure her, or dump her without explaining why ‚Äî so she is left to feel she wasn‚Äôt good enough, without ever knowing it was a sick and exploitive behavior that she was strong enough to say no to. 

It‚Äôs almost like women take pride in how much pain and humiliation they are willing to endure during sex. And much like pornstars once out of the business, only detoxing and expecting a healthy relationship emotionally and sexually will they realize how badly they‚Äôve been treated.

I don‚Äôt even feel like trying to talk some sense into these women, they don‚Äôt view other women as sisters, comrades, together in the fight for equality and better treatment and respect. They view us as the enemy, the independent, high value female that doesn‚Äôt need a man, but wants a man, and not just any man. Is it because we make them feel the error of their entire dating history? Do they just automatically want to compete for male attention and accolades? 

The toxicity of dating is going to require all of us women to step up and be accountable for our choices, and hold men to a standard. I just don‚Äôt see that happening unfortunately ‚Äî which is why the strategies I‚Äôve learned through you fabulous ladies I realize is exponentially important.

o0frbo,Why we should quit the diets/eating habits that make us miserable,"I wanted to post about diets, in relation to FDS because I feel that people‚Äôs issues with weight can be a hangover from pickmeisha days, and also because choosing the correct diet can be such a useful tool in many of our level up strategy. I want to point out that I am not a nutritionist, and I‚Äôm still on a journey to claiming a healthy level control of my diet, so keep that in mind in my post.

We all know that the patriarchy‚Äôs control over our body image and perception of beauty is a huge problem. It costs us lots of money, time, and often times any positive relationship with ourselves. Lots of us come into FDS on the back of years of yo-yo dieting, and more of us come in as comfort eaters/binge eaters. There is no question between the relationship between the two. 

I often feel like the effect of our diets on our level-up journey, and our pickmeisha ways, is underplayed. Both yo-yo dieting and binge eating lead people to become malnourished, and this can affect our judgement too, malnourishment often decreases our brain functionality. When I look back on my pickmeisha days, I know I gave losers a chance that I shouldn‚Äôt have, because my self-image due to my obsession with losing weight was awful, but also because I was too damn tired to sit down and really think about the effects my dating choices were having on mine. Being honest, I thought all my problems would disappear if I could just fit into a size X pair of jeans! 

Fad diets are a big business, and I‚Äôd argue that they are also a means to distract us. It works well, and the diets themselves are so ineffective and unsustainable that they keep you in a constant loop of binging and restricting. I think one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is the permission to stop restricting. 

I would not say the desire to lose weight on your level-up journey is a bad one, and from many of the posts that I‚Äôve read on here, lots of you ladies are doing it healthily. I would also say that if you‚Äôre a binge eater, an equally great gift would be to revaluate your eating habits too. 

I am just a strong believer that because food is our energy, it is important for us to supply ourselves with energy that is the best for us ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs giving up diets forever or starting to go to the gym more regularly and working out a food plan with a professional. Just as we are encourage to drop low value people on our journey, we should also drop unhealthy habits that bring similar energy. I think similar arguments can be made for smoking (cigarettes and weed), drinking alcohol, money spending habits, etc.

I won‚Äôt advise any post-diet journeys to take, as everyone is different and I think the thing the main thing I‚Äôd like to encourage is to do your own research, and find what works for you. What I will say, though, is that since I‚Äôve given up stupid extreme diets, and found FDS of course, I have gotten my life back, and I can now finally enjoy being alone.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what size you are, you deserve to be happy, safe, comfortable, and LVM-free.

o0fg05,"If He Wanted To, He Would: A Short Story","Look. If he wanted to, he would. It‚Äôs that simple.

He doesn‚Äôt have to be a millionaire to wine and dine you properly. A random bouquet of flowers are only 20 bucks, 10 if you pick them up at Whole Foods. My favorite lilies there were $14.99 last time I checked. And while he‚Äôs at Whole Foods, some nice steaks for 2 is only, what, 20 dollars? 30? And watching some tutorial on YouTube to cook those steak -- well, honey, that shit is free.

All I‚Äôm saying is: if he wanted to, he would.

Of course, this isn‚Äôt for a first date sort of thing, but maybe for a nice random ‚ÄúWe Survived Monday!‚Äù celebration after you‚Äôve been seeing each other for a while. And thinking of random things to celebrate, well, that‚Äôs also free. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a YouTube tutorial for it, too. There‚Äôs plenty of tutorials out there. Anything under the sun you wanna watch, you can. Baking, painting, woodworking, hell even multivariable calculus. He could learn it. That shit is free. 

And if he wanted to, he would. 

He could fix the leaky sink. Wash the rug. Assemble some furniture. You know, acts of service. If he wanted to, he would. Even if it isn‚Äôt your main love language, you wouldn‚Äôt mind it, right? A homemade steak dinner followed by a foot massage followed by a beautiful handmade headboard.  

Listen, girl: if he wanted to, he would.

And it‚Äôs not like steak au poivre or some fancy schmany French dish has to be an every night occurrence (but, of course, if he wanted to, he would). I mean, fuck, he could easily boil up some spaghetti. It takes thirty seconds to rip open a box and fill up a pot. You fuck off for ten minutes, then bam dinner‚Äôs ready. Not gourmet, but, hey, it‚Äôs something.

Lemme let you in on a little secret: if he wanted to, he would.

The best part of spaghetti is that cleanup isn‚Äôt even hard. Rinse one pot, and some plates, and like a fork. If y‚Äôall are one of those sorts of people who spins up spaghetti with a spoon, he‚Äôll have to rinse off some spoons, too. A daunting task, I know. Dare I say, downright herculean. But let me tell you, if he wanted to, he would.

He could even put the toilet seat down so you don‚Äôt plunge into toilet water when you go to pee in the middle of the night. And he could even scrub the toilet every now and again, too. It only takes twenty seconds. 

And if he wanted to, he would.

He could carry the diaper bag when y‚Äôall are out and about. He knows it‚Äôs heavy and chafes your shoulder. He could help put the stroller up in the car. Strap the baby into the car seat. Spare your eardrums from the screaming for once. 

And if he wanted to, he would. 

He could even remember your anniversary. He could even remember his own mother‚Äôs birthday, his kids‚Äô birthdays. 

And if he wanted to, he would. 

But here‚Äôs the thing. He doesn‚Äôt want to, so he doesn‚Äôt. He just straight up fucking doesn‚Äôt. 

He leaves the cooking to you. He lets toys pile around in the living room and lets you find out just how strangely sharp Barbies are on bare feet. He even leaves shit streaks in the toilet -- which you‚Äôd think with how long he‚Äôs in there every day (usually while you‚Äôre making dinner or caring for y‚Äôall‚Äôs kids, of course) he‚Äôd have time to clean the mess up. But no. 

And the reason is simple. It‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt want to. He doesn‚Äôt care. So he doesn‚Äôt. He fucking doesn‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs no amount of compromising or communicating that will change the fact that he doesn‚Äôt want to do that shit. I mean, really, who does? I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to clean up someone else‚Äôs shitstains off the toilet bowl or meticulously plan out grocery lists every week. But you love your family, and you want to show them your love, so you suck it up. You clench your nose and scrub the mystery slime off the shower. Maybe you don‚Äôt desperately want to, but you know that if you don‚Äôt, no one will. 

And he sure as shit doesn‚Äôt want to. So guess what? You get to work a full-time office job on top of your unpaid janitorial and line cook and mommy duties. 

All I‚Äôm saying is, if he wanted to take some of this load off you, he would.

But he doesn‚Äôt, so here you are working, like, three and a half fucking jobs, only one of which is paid (but don‚Äôt you ever forget that you make less than he does (but do forget that you took off two years from your career to bare and care for two of his kids)).

o0eeye,Beware of the self claimed ‚Äòreligious‚Äô men,"These days I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of my peers are coming forward with their religion and aren‚Äôt ashamed anymore to say that they believe in God. I‚Äôm glad that my religious peers can announce this without getting shamed or ridiculed for it. What I do refuse to accept are those men who claim to be religious when it‚Äôs convenient to them. I‚Äôve witnessed it from afar with my friends and family and they all told me that their self claimed ‚Äòreligious‚Äô exes were the worst out of all exes. They were manipulative, controlling, insanely possessive and most of all misogynistic. Here are some things you should be beware of: 

1. Tells you that a woman should now how to cook and clean. 

Please. It‚Äôs a well known fact that those men still stay at home since their mother still cooks for them and keeps his room tidy after he used it. There‚Äôs no way in hell that this man will lift a finger in the household since his father didn‚Äôt do it either and his mother and sisters have always done it.

2. Tells you that men shouldn‚Äôt be doing household chores.

As described in point 1. It‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs job for them.

3. Has sex with you before marriage than withholds it from you. 

I‚Äôve seen it so many times with my friends. They have sex with their boyfriend than all of the sudden, their boyfriend says that what they‚Äôre doing is wrong and against God‚Äôs will and what not. They even suggest breaking up over it since having a girlfriend is too tempting for them. Leave him ASAP when he suggests breaking up with him after you guys had sex. These guys are God fearing yet a slave of their own penis. 

4. Doesn‚Äôt let you meet their family and/or friends after 3+ months of dating. 

Real religious people date to marry. Dating isn‚Äôt even a thing in most religions. If he‚Äôs being secretive over you for more than 3+ months into the relationship than he has no interest in marrying you. Bonus if you guys already had sex. He wants his cake and eat it to.

Double bonus: he‚Äôll mostly use excuses like ‚Äúoh but I don‚Äôt let anyone meet my family‚Äù ‚Äúoh but my mother is really selective when it comes to potential wives‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to know each other for a bit longer before I can let you meet them‚Äù ‚ÄúMy mother judges every woman I‚Äôve ever brought to the house‚Äù and what not

5. Judges random women for their way of dressing.

This can range from ‚ÄúHer top/bottom is too revealing‚Äù to wishing her something horrible even though he doesn‚Äôt even know her. 

6. Sees women as creatures to have babies with.

He‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre wifey material when you cook, clean, pick a baby up or are nurturing in general.

7. Believes in 50/50 and even paying for more household stuff. 

He‚Äôll tell you that women work now too and that they should pay for their own things now too. Whether it‚Äôs basic female hygiene or diapers for the baby, you should now pay for yourself and even pay for his stuff. But as you know, household work is completely on you.

I must‚Äôve forgotten more points and feel free to add them but please ladies, beware of these self claimed ‚Äòreligious‚Äô men!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o0eeye/beware_of_the_self_claimed_religious_men/,1623763852.0,146,0.95,18,FemaleDatingStrategy,petitpoupee

o0azv7,To have the audacity of a white man...,"Edit: Can anyone remind me how to disable private messages bc I'm getting tantrums about hOw DaRe u rEjEcT cHaD

Ladies, I'm just floored.

I'm renting out the second room in my flat, and posted an ad online. It's beautiful &amp; in the central part of a big, in-demand city, right in the middle of a World Heritage Site, and available at one of the most in-demand times of the year. People are clamouring for places. Basically, I'm in the driver's seat here.

I'm a student, which means I'm exempt from a large tax where I live. Professionals would have to pay it, but I don't. If I live with a non-student, they get a 25% discount for living with me, but the tax itself still amounts to roughly ¬£2 000/year. I've been messaged mostly by women, who of course offer to pay for their own tax (if they're working), as again, I wouldn't be liable for that.

Until I got one message from a  S C R O T E. I could tell what he was going to be like the second I saw his photo - your classic roid-raged douche.

Ladies, this dude jumped RIGHT in, saying he expected me to pay for half of this tax (just to be extra audacious, yes, he meant half of the final figure AFTER the discount he would've gotten for living with a student had been deducted). This dude fully expected me to roll out the fucking red carpet for him.

And they call us gold diggers - give me a fucking break.

o0aesf,"Womem are ""Gold diggers""","I've been at a party recently and a discussion stuck with me. ""If she's not with you while you're making your fortune, she's a gold digger."" 

First of all, what if she didn't know you before ? Second, maybe you didn't have the occasion to meet her because she goes to places unaccessible to low earning people. If you think your gf is with you for your money, why date someone at all after you ""make your fortune""? 

I didn't ask any of these questions, what I asked was ""well usually men divorce their wives when they get rich and look for a ""prettier"" one. So technically when you become rich you want a ""gold digger"". How is that women's fault if you go explicitly for women that value money over anything else?""

Yeah that's not the same. Bla bla bla.

Why is ""gold digging"" a women specific term? Why men that ditch their families for younger women are not called ""child diggers ""? Why is it always women's fault and especially women they go after ?

o04iqk,"Never go to a ""life coach""","If you want to level-up through going to group or individual therapy, NEVER go to a ""life coach."" Please go to a licensed social worker/counselor/therapist/psychologist.

Licenses for mental health clinicians are regulated by a state or national government agency. They require a criminal background check, a degree from an accredited university,  hundreds-thousands of hours of training, passing board examinations, and annual continuing education credits.

Life Coaching has zero oversight and no requirements. Literally anyone can call themselves a ""life coach."" I know of quite a few life coaches in my area who could never be licensed to provide mental health services due to not having the required education, lying about credentials, criminal behavior, or lack of professional boundaries.

Examples: 
-Male ""life coach"" started dating a client and became incredibly controlling, manipulative, and abusive.
-Man rebranded himself as a life coach after losing his license as a psychologist for smuggling contraband into the prison where he worked.
-Man joined a ""healing"" trauma group (ran by a life coach) with the sole intend of trying to date the women in the group by preying on their emotional vulnerabilities. 

Before going to a therapist, always be sure to verify their license/credentials. This can usually be done on a government website. Even if their license is in good standing, always check to see if they have any prior complaints or violations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o04iqk/never_go_to_a_life_coach/,1623727423.0,387,0.95,54,FemaleDatingStrategy,Heather619
o03u7h,Personal growth and new age concepts that are scams:,"
1.  ‚ÄúTreat people the way you want to be treated.‚Äù  No.  ‚ÄúTreat people like they treat you.‚Äù  (Unless there is violence/ abuse.  In that case do everything possible to extract yourself from the situation.)  When I have been overly kind and understanding with people and given the ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt‚Äù people have just taken it as carte Blanche to take advantage of me.  Now if people blow me off or do not respond to a text for a week or two, I do the same and take my sweet time responding.  There is no need to be on demand for people to whom I am clearly not a priority.  I ignore texts from people who have legit ignored a question that I have asked and then attempt to pop up months or years later with ‚ÄúHi!  Thinking about you.‚Äù  (Depends on how well I know the person.  If it happens once and they acknowledge it and apologize then it‚Äôs ok.  But when they pull that ü§° move of friendship breadcrumbing, I‚Äôm done.)

Guess what?  Since I implemented that people don‚Äôt do that to me anymore.  Now if someone is rude or cold to me I do not attempt to ‚Äúkill them with kindness‚Äù, I just put up an energetic wall.  

2.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have any expectations.‚Äù  Reasonable expectations give us a sense of safety and control in a chaotic world.  Relationships are ongoing social contracts and we are constantly renegotiating them.  Eg, When you go to a restaurant and order something off of the menu, most people would agree that your food should be in accordance with what was written on the menu.  When you enter into romantic relationships there are all kinds of ways the dyad communicate with each other.  What frequently happens is that a man will promise steak to a woman but then serve an Iceberg lettuce salad with zero dressing to her.  Then he is surprised that she is angry and her ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù are too high.  I say have reasonable expectations and if he doesn‚Äôt meet them, Byeeeeee.

3.  ‚ÄúGive without expectation.‚Äù  Oh, hell no.  This just sets you up to be a doormat.  The only people to whom you ‚Äúgive without expectation‚Äù are children and charity.  It is so okay to have awareness of what you are giving to a relationship and observe if the other person matches your energy and efforts.  Yes, there is an ebb and flow to every relationship but there needs to be enough reciprocity for the relationship to work.

4.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù  Again, no.  It is okay to take things personally- at least initially.  If something is making you feel some kind of way don‚Äôt let people pressure you into being a ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù and just stuff it inside trying to repeat that mantra to push away how you truly feel.  Sit with your feelings, write it out, talk to the person who did NOT hurt you, etc‚Ä¶Then you can identify if that person is someone you want to continue to be in relationship with.  Eg, I got annoyed with a friend recently because she took 3 days to even acknowledge a text for making plans that SHE initiated.  I asked her to lmk by midday on Friday (plans were for a Monday).  She didn‚Äôt get back to me until Friday night and told me all about how she was sooooo busy socializing.  I might have felt differently if it was work, family, etc because people are legit busy but it made me FEEL (feelings are not facts) like I‚Äôm just not that important and definitely not high on her priority list.  I felt disproportionately angry (because she is a really good friend) so I recognized that it wasn‚Äôt that she did that but also that 2 other people did that to me within a week.  I live in the world Capitol of flakes btw.  So yes, I took it personally and felt my feelings and it also allowed me to recalibrate how I feel about the relationship.  I‚Äôm not ‚Äúholding it against her‚Äù but I‚Äôm aware that maybe we are not as close as I thought.  That isn‚Äôt bad or wrong it just allows me to have the aforementioned ‚Äúreasonable expectations.‚Äù

I could go on and on.  Please add to the list.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o03u7h/personal_growth_and_new_age_concepts_that_are/,1623725275.0,429,0.94,69,FemaleDatingStrategy,Aocwannabe
o02n0f,The way we are constantly gaslit as women.,"Ugh scrolling through Reddit in this shit sub and this woman posts a story that caught my attention. 

So basically her piece of shit boyfriend is away and decides to go to a strip club knowing it‚Äôll make her uncomfy. And doesn‚Äôt message her for 3 hours. Yayyyy. Even in my pick me stages I would never accept that bullshit. ANYWAY. 

That‚Äôs not all op‚Äôs boyfriend ends up ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spending $500. His best friend took it and spent it in private rooms LOL YEAHHHHHH RIGHT. For obvious reasons friends don‚Äôt usually steal $500 from other friends, and in the rare occurrence that they do that friendship is completely ruined and charges are usually pressed. Which op didn‚Äôt allude to at all, reading the comments these two are still very much friends and this friend who ‚Äústole‚Äù $500 is actually gonna help the bf plan a proposal. ü§¢ü§¢ 

Oh btw if y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt know already strip clubs are indeed places that men solicit prostitution. To my knowledge you get a girl in the vip room and offer her a few hundred for sex. Source : old friend was a stripper &amp; and would do this to support her drug habit.   

Even if that wasn‚Äôt what her piece of shit boyfriend did (which it most likely was) what really gets me is ALL the comments telling her that she needs to relax. That this is no big deal and the boyfriends friend is the only one in the wrong. 

What ??? In the actual fuckery is Reddit. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised to find out there are many troll accounts made by males to purposely gaslight women and lower our standards.

It's been very hard for me to come to terms with the fact that they mostly aren't the HV men I always thought they were.

I will edit this post to add that a lot of these feelings come from me having a young daughter and coming to realize how few men can actually be trusted around children.

o00y9f,Treat yourself well &amp; Treat Yourself ... you will be less likely to fall for LVMs,"I made a similar post to this talking about the importance of getting to know yourself sexually but I want to encompass how important it is to treat yourself very well in all aspects of your life.

I recently got into self care, picked up my hobbies again, and have treated myself to skincare/makeup/ new outfits. I even spent my money on decorations for my house and a piece of furniture to make life easier (and I used to be so cheap and see this stuff as frivolous)... loving yourself sounds cliche but you need to check up on yourself.

I'm loosing my grandpa and he always took great care of me, always buying me surprises and taking me for treats or letting me pick out small stuff at the stores. he'd give me spending money as a teen. anytime I needed or wanted anything he would do his best to surprise me with it. anytime I was sick, he'd run out and buy me gatorade, soup, and medicine. 

now I dont have anyone to make sure I am taken care of. he's gone senile. so I stepped up to the plate for my self and started taking better care of myself and spoiling myself.

I'm not saying be financially reckless, but stay within your means. try to take yourself for a nice meal when you can, buy yourself flowers and that treat/item you wanted, wear the clothes that make you feel happy, and don't be afraid to spend time with yourself sexually. as they say ""date yourself"". over time, you'll get even more enjoyment and peace out of being single. make your single life great! why? because then when some LVM comes along, or if you feel temptation to bend the rules, you'll quickly see how his LV behavior has such a contrast to how well you treat yourself.

I buy myself flowers, I cook/bake my favorite foods with effort, I enjoy my hobbies, I buy items to spoil myself and make myself feel good, I run myself a hot bath with scented candles in a clean, beautifully decorated bathroom where I can really relax and feel like I am in a sanctuary, and when I have sex with myself I really enjoy it and make sure I finish. sometimes, ill stop for an iced coffee because I know it instantly makes my day better! honestly if a man isn't willing to bring in this sort of treatment to the table for me, then WHY be with him? I can and will treat myself better. I am determined to give myself the good and wonderful life I deserve and enjoy what life has to offer. this Is part of what FDS means when it says that he needs to enhance your already fulfilled life, like he is sprinkles on top of the ice cream of your own life. 

there was a photo circulating around of a woman all dressed up and happy with a caption that said ""how her parents treated her"" and then another photo where she looks sad and miserable and more of a hot mess and it had the caption saying something like ""how her husband treats her"".... women don't ""let themselves go"" but the impact of how others treat you WILL catch up with you and will present itself. so treat yourself well, thrive, and add joy to your life because you will not want to sacrifice that for any LVM!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o00y9f/treat_yourself_well_treat_yourself_you_will_be/,1623716088.0,395,0.97,11,FemaleDatingStrategy,warinmymind94
o00h20,I feel like I saw my Past Pickme self standing in front of me in line today... Thank God for FDS,"today I was in line and a woman who looked to be somewhere between graduating high school and 21 years old was with her boyfriend. right away, you could see the amount of effort she put into, so early in the morning to get ready, throw on a thoughtful cute outfit, she had even done her hair and makeup. I wasn't even trying to notice them but she just kept making a scene and clinging onto him, while he groaned impatiently in line. his body language and sighing iimmediately reminded me of a fussy toddler. he looked like he had put no effort into his appearance at all, wearing a cheesy graphic t shirt that was wrinkled and baggy gym shorts and crocs. his face was super oily and his hair looked like it hadn't been washed either. 

I tried not to focus on them and decided to people watch instead, and how sad it was so see so many younger heterosexual couples where the woman was dressed to kill and so put together and the man looked like the rolled out of bed slob that was standing in front of me. 

then I heard the young woman in front of me start whining to her LVM boyfriend some more, but this time it really caught my attention. She said, ""Baaabbbbeee, do you have any cologne at home? I really want to buy you some."" Then she proceeded to actually BEG him to ""let her buy him"" cologne. Then suddenly she winced and asked him if he had brushed his teeth today, then she pointed out how she could see all the ""specs"" and that he didn't know how to brush... at his point I was so annoyed and replaced by them I was about to leave the line and try again later. She started telling him how he smelled and should use mouthwash and started coddling him, it was like a mother speaking to a toddler... y'all my stomach was literally turning. thank god for social distancing though. I couldn't believe I was hearing this with my own ears.

I kept making faces when she Was saying these things  (we need to start normalizing a grossed out and confused reaction to LVMs being man-children). seeing her act like this reminded me so much of myself when I was that young and just starting college, I was the same way where I was so hungry for male attention and validation I would spend so much time, energy, and money into getting all dolled up and never felt like the guys I were with wanted to be with me (they'd moan and groan just like her lvm was) so I would be like her and would try to hand hold and do all the cuddly / PDA stuff too. I wanted the dudes to like me so much, and like her, I believed that as a woman we just had to ""teach men"" and ""train them"" into being good boyfriends. I was a lot more shy and less PDA than her, but I still saw myself and remembered feeling like that. Her whole world was centered around that gross, stinky man child. of course when her turn came I saw her struggling to pay the bill and he wouldn't chip in. I could see how emotional she was getting because she couldn't understand why she was doing so much for him all the time and putting in so much, and why he couldn't even brush his teeth before meeting her. how devastating, and I imagine the overthinking, stress, and tears that happen often when she gets home, confused and defeated as to why he doesn't reciprocate even a fraction of her level of effort... especially when she thinks she is doing everything ""right"" that the patriarchy and other pickmes have ingrained into her mind

I felt so proud of myself for being single and leveling up from that toxic, mentally exhausting pickme lifestyle. going places is low stress, I don't have to worry about impressing anyone with outfits or makeup (saved a lot of money), and I dont have to feel like a puppy dog following around LVMs everywhere, trying not to be too ""emotional"" or ""clingy"", trying so hard to get their attention and even just a second of their affection, when knowing it will be a rare day that I ever get a treat. there's such a peace and freedom going out alone and running errands alone and this enjoyment of it that I never experienced as a pickme. no LVM could ever give me that.

I no longer feel jealous or lonely when I see couples, and seeing this pickme/lvm duo in real life actually made me feel queasy. I feel happier and more blessed than ever to have been leveling up and working on myself through FDS. it's one thing to level up and learn lessons through mistakes of your pickme past, but it was REALLY eye opening to see such an awful relationship in front of my own eyes, when you see strangers like I did, it really makes you see just HOW awful pickmeism is. Thank you FDS for showing me the light so I do not have to be in that trap again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o00h20/i_feel_like_i_saw_my_past_pickme_self_standing_in/,1623714570.0,565,0.93,33,FemaleDatingStrategy,warinmymind94
o00ce5,How age gap ruined me. Twice.,"Billie Eilish post inspired me.
I was 17 (legal where I lived) dating a 31 yo because he was ""more mature than guys my age"". Long story short:
-he was disgusted that I was still a virgin (you've NEVER done it before?)
-awful in bed, believe me, practise makes no master
-was a PUA and felt irritated that I cannot treat sex casually like women his age
-played the ""I am as youthful as your male peers"" card along with ""I am WAY better than your male peers"", depending on when was more suitable
-same as ""I am older and I know better, what do you even know about life"" along with ""Idc how old are you, age is just a number""
-no, he wasn't going to the music festival, parties, high school prom with me. I had to go ON MY VERY OWN (meaning without a guy and no flirting with guys out there), cause wanted to be faithful üôà while my friends were making out with their boyfriends at every party
-that first time felt lonely, it was a unique experience, but just for me. He was high body count
-prom felt sad. My friends dancing around to ""you're the one that I want! Hoo hoo hoo - honey!"" (was retro-themed) with their prom partners and me realizing I'm missing out on being young, innocent and silly




Then at 23 I've made the same mistake with another guy, 33.
-felt outcasted from my peers who were spending time in the louder part of town, while I was sitting home with my ""boyfriend""
-he already had thrombosis, so we could not spend more that 1h for instance sitting in the restaurant
-he wanted me to bring him to a party where people were even younger than me. I refused cause I knew I would make people uncomfortable. He threw a mantrum
-he invited me to his friends aged 36, the lady of the house introduced that she was pregnant with their second child - so not a scene for someone still at the university, it felt like family dinner and not a party
-my social life suffered a lot
-I felt detached from my colleagues since I had to take ""more grown up and adult"" pov and behavior
-it sucked the life and youth out of me
-when he said ""I think EVERY guy in his 30s should be seeing a girl that is at least 10 years younger"", that's when it hit me, he was entitled bastard and I just happened to be the age of his interest, it was not about me or my beauty or my virtues, it was just about my birth year

Since then I despise age gaps. Learn from my mistakes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/o00ce5/how_age_gap_ruined_me_twice/,1623714162.0,566,0.94,33,FemaleDatingStrategy,fak_beauty_standards

nzzalo,Trust He Sucks,"There‚Äôs a saying to never associate malice with an act when stupidity or ignorance also explains it. It is one of the biggest chunks of steaming bullshit that masquerades as advice you will ever get served up. It‚Äôs telling you to gaslight yourself. If you always assume the best of men, if you take them at their word, you are going to get hurt, a lot, and disappointed, a lot, because there are men who know you want to believe them and who will twist you up trying to make you find the right words to explain why what they‚Äôve done is wrong. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Don‚Äôt make excuses for them either. It‚Äôs not his childhood traumas, past girlfriends, the situation, his lack of social skills- it‚Äôs him. Why he hurt you doesn‚Äôt matter- he‚Äôs proven he‚Äôs not safe.

The absolute safest thing for you to do when a man hurts you is assume that he did know what he was doing, he meant it, he wanted to, and he‚Äôll do it again, and act accordingly- this goes for any type of abuse. Your body, your time, your attention, is not his prize or motivation for taking on the journey to becoming a decent person, you are not a redemption arc, and he won‚Äôt change. He won‚Äôt change- not because you aren‚Äôt good enough, but because he isn‚Äôt good.

When we search for excuses or the reasons behind why this particular man just doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why his behavior is wrong or want to change, we are investing way too much of our energy and focus into someone who isn‚Äôt worth it. This goes for overanalyzing past behaviors of exes. Trust he sucks.

The worst relationships I‚Äôve gone through have had red flags about his behaviors that I justified to myself about. I gave him chance after chance to behave. I explained so many times and in so many ways how he was hurting me. I put all of myself into being a kind loving partner. In doing this I wasn‚Äôt being kind or loving to myself. I associated his abusive actions to paternal abuse and abandonment, his commitment issues to his parents relationship and divorce, figured I was just too picky or not open-minded enough when we disagreed on core values. I ended up fleeing to a domestic abuse shelter. At least it wasn't a body bag.

There's a reason we dump men at the first sign of him being inconsiderate. It's for our safety. There's a reason we discuss our high standards and vetting strategies. A lot of our content isn't just about dating, it's about surviving. We are taught through our socialization to ignore our gut feelings, to feel guilty about saying no, to think the best of others. We put others potential hurt feelings, especially male feelings, over our own safety. We are worth more than that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nzzalo/trust_he_sucks/,1623711036.0,1354,0.89,99,FemaleDatingStrategy,jackrusselterror1
nzxisi,Update: Saw My Ex on OLD.,"Ladies, thanks for the great comments on my previous post about seeing my ex on OLD. I have an update. 

As counterproductive and creepy as it sounds, I looked again today after sitting with the ick feels of yesterday. This time, I was able to accomplish my original goal: to see something tangible regarding my ex through a complete FDS lens and kill any remaining hope. Here is what I realized:

1 . Ultimately, the profile isn‚Äôt glaringly horrible. It drips low effort such as: I like alcohol, sports, I am at my kid‚Äôs beck and call, I am a homebody, want someone to stay home and cuddle and drink with. That is it in a nutshell. Nothing at all about his hobbies, interests, things he would like to do, what he‚Äôs looking for outside of I want you to make me happy. There‚Äôs literally not a single word about what he is bringing to the table or what qualities make him a worthy partner. If that doesn‚Äôt scream, please come fill a void, I don‚Äôt know what does. Also, there were no full body shots and the pics weren‚Äôt flattering. Definitely hiding his major weight gain. Something about it felt kind of sad and desperate. 

2. This is the kicker. I mentioned in my previous post that he basically described our relationship. And ya know what? He did. Our relationship was LV as fuck. We were lazy. We didn‚Äôt motivate each other. He never held me accountable for being my best self or really encouraged me about anything. There was no follow through. He held me back, sucked me dry, and took advantage of me. 

This isn‚Äôt me. This isn‚Äôt what I want. I deserve better than being an emotional airbag. I have boundaries and standards. I deserve someone who actually cares about what I do, my health, my happiness. I don‚Äôt want a lazy relationship. I don‚Äôt want low effort. I don‚Äôt want to fill the void that someone has within themselves. 

I NEVER WANT THAT SCROTE BACK!!! BARF!!!!!

Omg I feel better than I have in ages. Having   a safe space here in FDS to write out various steps in my journey and knowing there‚Äôs fellow queens out there doing the hard work of leveling up, sharing thoughts and journeys ( even the ones that are kind of embarrassing like this one), and giving each other support and tough love have been key.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nzxisi/update_saw_my_ex_on_old/,1623706071.0,304,0.91,31,FemaleDatingStrategy,alphasquish

And I‚Äôm so angry! Jack Black was no slim guy who took actual care of himself in that film, yet that doesn‚Äôt get any mention! No, it‚Äôs all about the size of the women. Just more double standards.

So I‚Äôm going to fold my underwear and instead focus on how I think they‚Äôre pretty and an added bonus they don‚Äôt set off my pain!

I cannot imagine how much farther along I would be in life had I not wasted those years, had I not been emotionally destroyed, but all that money... it boggles my mind. It makes me furious.

nzprjq,On porn and sex work,"Recently I‚Äôve been encountering men who claim to be allies to women. 

I ask, ‚Äúdo you watch porn/consume pornographic content?‚Äù

The answer is ALWAYS yes. 

Ladies, a man can never be a true ally to women, a true HVM, if he watches porn!

He claims, ‚ÄúI want an emotional attachment to a woman during sex‚Äù.  Okay, then why do you objectify women (by watching porn) in the same breath? You can love one woman physically, and then at the same time, use another as an object of your sexual fantasies. Look at the cognitive dissonance, the contradiction. You can‚Äôt claim to love all women, if it‚Äôs NOT ALL WOMEN you love and respect. 

Men lurkers, if you love women, want to be a strong ally to women, STOP WATCHING PORN. STOP ENABLING SEX WORK. 


Porn and sex work are wrong. Period. Women should not have to be subjected to the male gaze. Women should not have to exploit their bodies and be treated as objects. Full stop. 

Men who claim to love and support women, yet who still consume pornographic content, are the same as a man saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not homophobic, but I don‚Äôt wanna be hit on by one of them‚Äù. You‚Äôre still homophobic in that scenario. You‚Äôre still misogynist and adhering to the patriarchy. Fuck off. 

Ladies, we‚Äôve found a gem with FDS, helping us proclaim our worth and stick to it!! Don‚Äôt cross the picket line. 

I find myself wanting to say something on my social media about this, but I know all the sex work-positive people on my timeline would fucking try to drag me and I don‚Äôt have the time for that. 

Sex work should not be a thing. Women‚Äôs bodies are not to be exploited, just as our own ‚Äúregular‚Äù labor doesn‚Äôt need to be exploited either. It‚Äôs the same concept. We should not live in a society where exploitation is even necessary to live. 

It starts with us. It starts with us, saying ENOUGH.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nzprjq/on_porn_and_sex_work/,1623685512.0,435,0.81,60,FemaleDatingStrategy,FemmeFreedom
nzp16k,What is even the point of being in a world where you are constantly preyed upon and looked down upon I don‚Äôt even have the energy to keep working or going on anymore,"EDIT: i just wanted to thank everyone for all the support I am much calmer now i am not going to kms or rage quit. I am going to work on channeling the anger but all the support here has really calmed me down i  am not raging anymore lol



----------------------------------




Even if I leave my current job (bosses who don‚Äôt respect me, team members hitting on me or looking down) I know it will be the same at my next. It was the same at my last too. They will never see women as anything other than an object. Even if there are HVM there are probably maybe 5 out of 4 billion and they are not going to speak out against the LVM running the world.  

I am really at my wits end. Like I want to rage quit but I don‚Äôt have any other options and I don‚Äôt have the mental strength to keep working while looking for a new job, and I don‚Äôt even have the courage to end it all I just feel so stuck. And I‚Äôm tired of trying to be a pioneer for the next gen of women, I don‚Äôt have the mental strength to do it. Based on what the women of the past have gone through it‚Äôs still always the same you just have to have the grit to keep going. And I just can‚Äôt keep going. 

Also this was my throwaway [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nycobs/should_i_talk_to_my_manager_about_a_male_coworker/) two days ago about a new male coworker making me uncomfortable but my replies aren‚Äôt showing. I decided not to speak to my boss because I realized that while he is good at acting very nice, he is deep down a sexist POS and he absolutely loves the other guy. And during a meeting today I brought some other issue up and it felt like during it my manager and another higher up were kind of making fun of something (messaging each other and saying something like hey did you get that) idk if they were making fun of me but why do that while I was talking and trying to explain something that I‚Äôm struggling with. 

And I posted another [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nd2hq3/how_do_you_keep_your_head_up_and_keep_going_when/) before regarding how they gave better work to two guys who came after me and just kept me working on something basic. And now two more guys joined and I feel like it will be the same thing I‚Äôm just so tired of it all.

And then I sometimes wonder if all this is because of my ADHD maybe it‚Äôs not even because I‚Äôm a woman. But I‚Äôve been overworking because of ADHD and to not fall back and I really don‚Äôt think I am less smart or capable than the male members of my team.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nzp16k/what_is_even_the_point_of_being_in_a_world_where/,1623683594.0,311,0.95,26,FemaleDatingStrategy,abby_ch238
nzokt2,This article makes a case against poly relationships. 'It‚Äôs good to have friends. It‚Äôs good to have multiple confidantes. But people aren‚Äôt just fungible widgets in a factory. You don‚Äôt just lump them in a shopping bag until your heart is full.',"I found this article on another sub (not sure if allowed to link here?) and it really spoke to me as someone whose LVX used poly/open relationships to justify cheating. 

[https://www.countere.com/home/unethical-slut-dark-side-of-polyamory-not-natural](https://www.countere.com/home/unethical-slut-dark-side-of-polyamory-not-natural)

A lot of the article rang true for me but this paragraph especially sums up how my ex thought and how  he sees women, and I think it embodies FDS ideals as well:

' It‚Äôs true, as they say, that Mr. or Ms. Right isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúfill all the gaps‚Äù: s/he won‚Äôt fix everything or make your life complete. But that‚Äôs not because you aren‚Äôt having sex with enough people; it‚Äôs because spiritual satisfaction comes from within. Everything whole and valuable about you, ultimately, occurs between your two ears and with your higher power. But rather than cult ivating the soul, polyamory translates everyone into stuff on a grocery store shelf, compared to some idealized shopping list. Polyamory is consumerism disguised as spiritual evolution. '

Non-monogamy (and - though not covered in the article - dating apps) encourages men to see women as commodities and collectors' items.

nzlzge,Billie Elish bf is 10 years older than her.,"I wouldn't call myself a huge fan, I just like some songs but honestly this whole thing with her new bf is just sickening.

Thousands of men bragging how it's normal for young girls to like older men (ah yes, girl and man) and how they are on their 30-40s and find women fresh out of high school 'hot' made me sick to my stomach. Do they literally have no shame admitting that??

There's a huge difference between thinking a young person is physically attractive, but if you're 10+ years older than then and you want to date and have a sexual relationship with them? Something's wrong with you. Sorry lurkers, accept it. Get help.

What's also disturbing is the huge amount of young girls that are already groomed into thinking age gap relashionships are normal and not weird and their only defense is ""WeLl iTs leGaL!"" And ""Girls mAture FastEr"". As if we didn't know already how the later one is purely used to justify disgustingly huge age gap relashionships. Cause yes me, a 21 year old definitely has the same maturity as a 40 year old man!!!/s


I just feel like Billie and that sc##bag of a man bf she's dating (cause besides a groomer he's also a racist and homophobic ), will normalise age gap relashionships even further. Young women that look up to Billie may be even more influenced by this and I don't want to imagine how this in combination with the libdem ideology will turn out.

 I‚Äôm very specific about the type of guy I‚Äôm into. Looks are important *of course* but he has to be emotionally intelligent and self aware. Funny too, that‚Äôs important. Men aren‚Äôt funny and I regret ever fake laughing at their stupid jokes to keep the peace.  Another important thing is that he has to have masculine energy. I don‚Äôt want to babysit a grown ass adult. Unlike the average man, women aren‚Äôt pedos looking to abuse and control younger boys. We want *grown* men who are independent and not waiting around to be fed like babies. Unfortunately modern men have very low T levels so it‚Äôs gonna be hard to find someone like this.

nz8nu2,"The ""Older Man"" myth, debunked","The more I speak to other women and girls around me, it seems to be almost a rite of passage for us to date/have dated an older man who could NOT abide by the campsite rule. 

For those of you who aren't familiar, the campsite rule was coined by love and sex columnist/podcast host Dan Savage of Savage Love, who would preach that while it is most reasonable for people to date someone in or around their own age, that age-gap relationships can only succeed if the older party - usually the man - treated their younger partner like a campsite. Help them clean up the rubbish, spruce it up a bit, and when the time comes for the relationship to end, **leave the campsite better looking than when you found it.** 

As in, as the older partner, you have an obligation to understand that your younger partner is not at the same life stage as you are, and so you should treat them accordingly - with gentleness, with care, and to be a guide for them. Now, in an ideal world this would always be the case for men and women. Alas, we don't live in such a world, as many of us have unfortunately experienced firsthand. 

For all you baby-FDSers, recovering pickmes, and former pickmes: here are some lessons I've learned that I would like to share. 

1. **If an older man showers you with compliments that set you apart from ""other girls,"" beware.** You know the kind; all those other girls are slutty and sleep around, but **YOU'RE** pure and innocent. Inexperienced. All those other girls are stupid and only love to drink and club, but **YOU'RE** smart and clever. All those other girls are so immature, but **YOU** are an old soul. These are all words they manipulate you with to make you feel like you're the chosen one, you're the one he deems worthy enough to be picked. This is how he alienates you, especially from other women in your life who you then start comparing yourself to and feel morally superior. 
2. **If an older man tries to use his life experience to dissuade you from making your own decisions, beware.** If he tries to flex on you with his age, and dismiss any of your own thoughts and opinions as childish, it means that he doesn't respect you as a person. It's one thing to engage in a thoughtful, equal discussion. No one wants to be with a steamroller, but if you engage with one there's only one way it'll leave you - FLAT. I myself was trying to, at 18, encourage my 24-year-old ex to go back to night school while he wasted his days away on video games and shitty food. He constantly held his age over me. Age does not equal maturity.
3. **If an older man isn't generous, RUN.** No one here is trying to look for a sugar daddy, and generosity doesn't have to be only about money. It can be with time, effort, in the bedroom, in thoughtfulness. But if he can't be generous with you, i.e. coming to pick you up, buying you lunch, taking you out and treating you with kindness and respect...well then, what the heck did he spend all those extra years for?? Don't be the one left holding the bill and bending over backwards to make all the effort yourself for an old scrote.
4. **Listen very carefully to his ""Good Old Days"" stories.** Does any of that rub you the wrong way? My ex would tell me how he harassed his ex-gf proudly. He would tell me stories of how he would be the driver of the car while his friends would grope at drunk girls in the backseat, and how he never stopped them because his friends ""were losers back then and deserved some action."" He would talk about how he would pick random women up by his shoulders and how he was so drunk he dropped a young woman one time on the dance floor and broke her phone. I could fill an entire book of his shitty behaviour that should have been glaring red flags, but he assured me that it was all in ""good fun back in the day."" Trust me, you do NOT want to be gaslighted and brainwashed into thinking treating people this way is good. Don't believe me? Just take a look at The Red Pill. They are all brainwashed into thinking treating women like literal trash is a commendable action. 
5. **Observe how he speaks about the people in his life.** With your old man having more life experience than you, he will have at least a handful of exes or children he fathered in a relationship. How does he talk about his children's mother? His children? Does he uplift them in a positive way, or does he speak with bitterness and bile? Is he that unfortunate that all his exes are crazy psychos? Do you really think his wife, who he has been with since high school, is okay with an open relationship? Does she even know? How does he talk about his siblings, his parents? A mature man will have respect for himself to uplift the loved ones around him, not disparage them every chance he gets. 
6. On that note, **observe how he talks about the people in YOUR life.** As he is older, there's going to be a lot of references, pop culture, music and arts, and many other aspects of life that he just doesn't ""get."" Chances are, he will already have a set way about him that prevents him from having an open mind. He will try to alienate you from your friends, your family, and convince you that he is the only one that cares about you. He will do nothing to integrate himself into your social circle, but sabotage it. He will have you convinced that all boys your appropriate age are pigs, and that all your girlfriends just don't understand your love. He will insist that he knows best, because he's older than you and is just trying to look out for you. 
7. **He will constantly talk about how he can provide for you (but do nothing)**. He will paint a pretty picture of a secure future, where you can pursue any career you want, be a SAHM if you want, don't worry baby I'll make sure you have everything you need...you're set for life with me, an older man that can PROVIDE. **THIS IS A TRAP**. This is a trap to make you believe that, by breaking up with him, you will lose the security that we all long for in this life. He says these things to convince you that he is your only hope at a happy future, one with financial and emotional security. Do not believe him. The only person who should provide for you at your young, tender age is YOU. 

I could honestly write an entire book on this. There are so many young girls and women who are being groomed by society, social media and the patriarchy that boys their own age are immature, and therefore they should look to the affections and embrace of an older, silver fox of a man to be happy and fulfilled. They don't know that most older men, with a very marginal exception, go after young teenaged girls or young women just coming into their 20s on their own so they can target someone who literally doesn't know better. They are predators, who want to use the vitality and youth and innocence of a young person to advance their own sick agendas of feeling youthful, living vicariously, and enforcing control over someone who might be too meek to say NO. 

FDS tweens, teens, and anyone in between - before you start crushing on an older man who makes you feel oh-so-special, please heed my words. I not only speak for myself, but for all other women who now know better and can see these creeps grinding and creeping from a mile away. I promise that we do not say this out of jealousy or because we're old. We want you to be confident in yourself FIRST, so that you can shut these gross older men down with confidence, and sashay away from a hot, piddling mess!

nz8hj6,Seeing Ex on OLD,"So, I am a few months out of a broken engagement, initiated by me. I was devastated, but his life was such a mess and it was affecting my mental health and I realized how toxic he and situation were. I did not do this lightly. I‚Äôve been working on leveling up, expanding my social circle, etc. I‚Äôve been making great progress, but I have had these little slivers of wishing my ex and I would find our way back to each other. Logically, I know it won‚Äôt happen, but those emotions are there, but certainly not all the time. This was probably a bonehead and unqueenly idea, but I reactivated my former OLD account, did a very quick search, and boom‚Ä¶there‚Äôs my ex. I thought maybe it would help drive it home it‚Äôs over, which it did (OLD account was immediately deactivated after. Outside of not being ready to date, fuck OLD and the scrotes that flock to it).

It also made me very sad. I was able to somewhat see through FDS lens that it was a very LV profile and also did not mention one of his main hobbies (hid it from me bc he thought I‚Äôd hate it, which is really weird bc it‚Äôs nothing bad, and should have been a huge red flag at the time). So, logically and thanks to FDS, I know he sucks and someone is going to get lovebombed and sucked in quickly because he doesn‚Äôt want to be alone - just like he did with me after being divorced for 5 minutes (another thing he was cagey about). I know it‚Äôs no longer my cross to bear and I dodged a bullet. It still hurts though. I was basically a cute emotional airbag for him, and had I just kept my mouth shut, I could have been a cute airbag wife.

I‚Äôm so, so glad I stood up for myself and refused to accept his LV ways and lack of responsibility. I did genuinely love him, and I really thought for awhile we would make it because love conquers all, bullshit blah blah. I am not ready to date yet. I still love this person. I am not ready to get to know or be intimate or commit to someone right now, until I am able to say with full honesty I am over him and ready. He has every right to do as he pleases. It just sucks that after loving someone and being vulnerable after a decade of mainly being alone, this was my experience. I can‚Äôt just move on after a few months. Every day gets easier. I made the right call. Just needed to rant a bit as I‚Äôm feeling sad and kind of pickme-ish right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nz8hj6/seeing_ex_on_old/,1623625445.0,165,0.92,52,FemaleDatingStrategy,alphasquish

ejf4a2,Let's talk about the hypocrisy.,"So I made the choice (mistake) to get back on ""the apps"". A decision I regret daily, if not more frequently than that. At this point I'm not looking for a serious relationship as I'm moving in a few months but I'm also not completely disregarding going on dates as I think ""monk mode"" is silly. I'm also upfront about the fact that I'm leaving but still open to meeting people and seeing what happens. It's more psychological experiment than *looking for my soulmate*.

I say all that to say, the amount of guys who are just looking for casual sex is astounding. Not even just on tinder, but also on the other apps that are more geared towards relationships. For every genuine guy who starts a conversation, there's 20 guys who hit you with the ""wyd"", ""u up"", ""what are u looking 4?"" and various other bullshit that just means, ""I want to fuck"" (double points for the dudes who literally just say ""I want to fuck"" as their conversation starter, those absolute kings). 

I made a post yesterday about how in Ali Wong's new book, she talks about men paying for the **first date** is a sign of effort and an indication of interest and is only fair since we go through extra efforts to be presentable in society. Nobody ever said ""he has to pay for literally every interaction, ever, for the rest of time."" I don't believe that and I definitely didn't say it. That being said, the PickMes and the men hit the post and my inbox with a bunch of whinging bullshit about *gold digging sluts* and ""*but my boyfriend and I split everything and he totally respects me and almost never cheats""*. Like, ok, congrats. That's not what I'm talking about. 

I'll say it again, paying for dates is a **sign of effort**. In the same way that I show up with my hair done, nails done, wearing expensive perfume, wearing non-Walmart branded attire, after getting my body lasered and my eyebrows waxed and the million other shitty things we have to do to be presentable as women. Do men have to put in effort to look good? Kinda. Maybe a decent shirt, real pants if we're lucky, a haircut every few months. But they could also ask out the girls who choose to do none of that effort and they can sit around in sweatpants looking like trash together and pay for the KFC bucket split between them while they watch hentai. Whatever, low effort shit. 

But I'm getting off topic. Women are ***dragged*** for wanting a man to show **effort**. Open doors, buy the first dinner, make actual plans in advance and communicate those plans effectively. These are not huge things. In fact, the fact that these things are even negotiable would be laughable 10 years, but dating is dead so here we are. Women are equally dragged if we ***don't*** put in effort. Our looks are a public commodity, open for ridicule if we don't maintain high physical standards for ourselves.

Which gets me back to my recent OLD experience. Why is it perfectly acceptable, expected, and totally OK for random dudes to degrade me, attempt to use me for sex, ask me to put my bodily safety at risk, so they can masturbate with my body? Why is the state of dating such that I get 10x more propositions for ""NSA FWB fun"" than I do an actual, sit-down, look-each-other-in-the-eyes, honest-to-goodness, conversation date? This is some stone cold bullshit. And mens' appearance isn't nearly as closely scrutinized and gatekept for date-ability. 

And don't talk to me about ""well you're asking for it, you're on *apps.""* This is a strawman. Everyone is on apps. Doctors. Lawyers. My roommate. Acting like women are *asking for it* because they're on tinder is so fucking stupid I literally can't even. 

I had a convo with a guy on tinder yesterday. He said ""can you ditch work for an hour and come fuck?"" I truly do not understand if men understand **how work, works** or the logistical ridiculousness of this question because I have heard it, no joke, 3 times in the last two weeks. I told him, ""I don't have sex with strangers."" and he said ""I respect that, I don't either"". Fucking *lol*. He asked, ""will you make an exception for me?"" and I said ""why would I put my safety at risk for your enjoyment?"" and he said, verbatim, ""well I guess I should become a not stranger"".

We want effort. Men want to put in ***literally the least amount of effort possible.*** If we start out meeting them ""halfway"", it'll be mere days before he's expecting you to be okay with the *lowest* effort. Not just in ""who pays for dates"", in everything. You'll stop **going on dates** and start ""hanging out"". He'll shower less. He'll start expecting you to cook and clean more. He'll stop trying in bed. If you allow a man to take an inch, they'll take the whole fucking mile and then lose respect for you for giving anything at all. He'll say ""*you've changed*!"" because you regressed to the slums with him. The reality is, he wants *you* to put in effort, not him. If you think I'm exaggerating, you just... haven't met men? 

Men are pragmatic in their approach to relationships. ""I want sex for the least amount of effort because it makes me feel good. I don't respect girls that give me sex easily because if she sleeps with me for no effort, she's sleeping with anyone for no effort and why should I value her time and body if she doesn't? To get sex, I have to try exactly ***this*** much and put forth ***this much time and energy****.""* And don't be confused, guys will shit test you. They'll see if they can slack on being reliable, dressing well, putting in the work, and they'll calibrate their effort accordingly, which is why we have to hold ourselves to rigorous standards an expect the same of the people we allow into our lives (and bodies). 

If you think I'm wrong, please start giving those low effort men your precious time. Start sleeping with people who haven't earned it. Devalue yourself to learn the very expensive lesson that you don't mean shit to someone that thinks **buying dinner is too much. Going on dates is too much commitment.** Or learn from the collective mistakes of the women in this sub and realize that having high standards is the only way to maintain your integrity and self respect. Your standards and self-worth will be the only thing standing between you and a thousand men who see you as absolutely nothing but cheap recreation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ejf4a2/lets_talk_about_the_hypocrisy/,1578056516.0,301,0.95,62,FemaleDatingStrategy,Liz_Lemondrop

ej4mnc,How to know if he's catfishing or lying to you,"So i've been watching enough local catfish shows and no i don't mean people who don't look like their picture, i mean men who look identical to their picture, they did not lie about their height (he truly is 6' like he said or he is 5'10 like his bio stated, no 5'8 or 5'7 surprises), they're charming and have a beautiful smile but...they're married and told you they're single. They lied about their name or work place, from a call center worker he becomes a CEO of a not known company that you can't find on google. Those men, the liars who don't spare details about their very fake richness but won't pick up the phone after 7 because some emergency happens. Those who often lead a double life. I noticed these man have a very similar pattern somewhat:

&amp;#x200B;

**They will not spend money on you**

After watching almost 20 episodes, all those men had a very common habit of not paying. They will ask you on a 'romantic' date that will be a picnic in the park or wine and dine on the beach or a walk in the park but never a restaurant and if it will be a restaurant they will not pay. How can they pay for your meal if they spin plates and lie to 5 other women or more? make it harder to lie to you, use you and manipulate you. Your time IS money and in that case it should be the meal. Watch how he forgets his wallet or something happened and that's why he can't pay for your meal...not because he's simply broke or dating many other women.

**They will often mention that they have money or that they're rich and often mention assets (3 apartments, a big house, a yacht) yet you never saw a single one**

If they're so rich and so successful...why would they brag yet never show you proof? where's his fancy sports car and why is he always renovating his apartment? it's too good to be true. Many men would know that it seems fake and show you a proof, otherwise they wouldn't brag if they want to keep their richness 'lowkey'.

**Unavailable on weekends or most weekdays**

If you're that busy why would you try to date if you can't even make time to shoot me a simple text? they're with their wife and kids on the weekends, not a fishing trip with rich friends. I promise.

They will sometimes use 2 phones, turn around the phone when someone sends a text so you wouldn't see who it is. They will most likely cancel dates or somewhat get flaky and ask to meet up later at night and his place or your place. They will mostly text you late at night.

**They will not introduce you to family**

Their family knows who they really are and unless his family are a psychopath pack that come together like a beer pack, they will *not* be a part of it and most of the times they will cut the man off. Their family mostly does *not* play along so if you've been official and you hasn't seen his parents it's because he's either married, lying about who he is or you're the side-chick.

**They will ask you for small amounts of money**

It will start with 5$ gas money and then 20$ for a gift and they always promise you they'll pay you back but never do, if you leave your wallet and return and you have money missing, don't give a man the benefit of the doubt. He stole it. I thought the man was rich, how come he needs 5$ if he has a yacht? it simply does not add up. They want to leech off you and take as much advantage as you can.

**Their life is 'full' of tragedies**

They want to make you feel pity and empathy, they want you to feel bad for them. Sometimes you have to stop and ask yourself ""did his parents really have cancer while his dead wife had his \*also\* dead baby while his grandmother is in the hospital?"" sure, sometimes people have a very sad life story but sometimes it's just too sad to be true. If you have doubts use google, see if his grandfather really is hospitalized at this specific hospital, google up his parents names, try to find their facebook, etc.

**They will seek vulnerable victims**

If you tell a man ""I just broke up with my boyfriend"" or ""I'm going through something"" and he's a psychotic catfish or a manipulative man, he will use it. He will be so nice and kind to you, lovebomb you and then tell you how he gave everything to you and how he was there for you when no one else was.

**They will refuse to take any pictures**

They will not take any pictures with you because ""It ruins the moment"" or whatever bullshit excuse they might give you and if they do take a picture...he will not post it anywhere. It's a big red flag.

**They reveal too much too fast about their life yet act secretive about small stuff later on**

They will tell you their whole family died within 2 days of talking but not tell you where he been last night after 2 years of dating. They're secretive about the wrong stuff but too open about other stuff. They will make you feel guilty for even asking and act as if you don't trust them when really, they don't trust you.

**They will give you false promises and hopes**

They will tell you how they want to marry *you*, include *you* in their future, want to have kids with *you* but never have any solid plans. They just want to keep you around. They will also say ""I love you"" without even meeting you.

&amp;#x200B;

This can apply to any guy regardless if he's catfishing or just a liar. Google up his place of work, google up his name, find info.

ej3j29,Why is the concept of a man paying for a date so triggering and nightmarish to some men?,"I keep hearing is brought up completely randomly as some sensationalist horror meme to manipulate people, alongside ""entitlement is evil"". 

Oh and‚Ä¶lemme clarify. I‚Äôm apathetic about this personally or used to be (no, didn't date around--was focusing on myself until I found an exception). Ended up meeting a sweet, cute man my age that pays autonomously anyway despite me never asking and he‚Äôs my fianc√© now anyway. Buuuuut‚Ä¶I woulda lived without it. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶really nice and he doesn‚Äôt want me to worry. So now it feels normal and for the first time in my life someday I might actually want to have a child--granted in 10 years the marriage still goes strong. I didn't at all expect this (this was my fun best friend, we just talked for many months and hundreds of hours before he confessed), yet this has surprisingly made me feel genuinely safe and not pressured that I always would have to work and take care of the house and child. The option now exists. 

Only a few years ago it was normal in society for men to pay for dates. Yet I‚Äôve seen dudes out there screeching about how psychopathic and love-destroying it is (LOL). 

Let‚Äôs see why a man paying for a date is fairer than it seems‚Ä¶

* Women objectively face more of the worst risks of dating more often in the short and long term (pregnancy is life-annihilating); and men are gifted with having to worry mostly just about money. You‚Äôre meeting a stranger; you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen. Most men probably have ‚Äúfuck or duck‚Äù on their minds. Hell, a man who pays then expects sex on the first few weeks is a gigantic red flag‚Äîwhich is great for us to see so we can dump him
* Apparently women have a ‚Äútime frame‚Äù to get this shit done and so their youth and time is valuable and precious 
* Women usually spend 100-1000$s on their looks a year and a ton of emotional, mental, and physical labor maintaining them in multiple ways, while men mostly spend peanuts and sometimes work out
* Dolling up also takes a ton of time; time is money
* (Crudely) shows initiative and investment on the part of the man which is actually a lot more important for women to look for. I‚Äôd say the man who pays more on average cares more (not always); research usually shows the same

Oh. And my favoritest: 

*  Hhem. So. Lemme get this right. You ask out a girl on a date, exhibiting the typical blatant gender traditions, want to show her a good time and impress her probably waste her time, spend gas money‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶you just want to pay half? 

I guess that‚Äôs fine. Plenty of decent dudes buy into it, sure, but I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that crazy to prefer the tradition frame, weighing what women have to do and sacrifice.

I think more intuition can be used to judge payers versus 50/50ers (both can be bad or good), though I feel like if you want men to pay and feel reluctant, then‚Ä¶you might as well just be forthright instead. It does the men who aren‚Äôt into that a favor too. Better be honest up front then get pissed at them later for being cheap - which is what often happens - but for whatever reason this seems to inspire extreme outrage in men instead. TOTALLY makes logical sense. 

There seems to be this really‚Ä¶bent push for extreme centrism and equality between the genders in ‚Äúall‚Äù ways. A willful refusal to understand that in some ways things are just unfair, and‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be honest‚Ä¶*just not worth it to a lot of women if they have to break even on everything (because in nature things aren't equal, there's far different risks).* I don‚Äôt actually think the world can even compute egalitarianism yet in a wholesome, good way. And even then it won‚Äôt always be perfect, because Biology is unfair as hell, and so are gender relations. 

Why is this so complicated to understand? I'm not saying men are obligated to pay for everything or should be held 100% accountable for the severe depravity and flippantness of many of their peers, but some things are just quite easy to do.

dscnbs,My experience as a Red Pill Woman,"I'm sharing this in the hopes that younger women than me will learn from a heart-wrenching mistake I made a couple of years ago.

I didn't know the lingo at the time, but I used to be a Red Pilled Woman. When I was 26, I met a cute(ish) rugby player when he was visiting my state for the summer. We ""fell in love"" (never trust a man that says he loves you in the first 3 months) and he moved up to live near me, leaving his job, his dog with his ex, his apartment, and almost all of his stuff to live with a friend. Of course that living situation didn't work out so he ended up living with me within a month. 

I worked 50+ hours a week, he worked on part-time trucking contracts. I cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner even though he stayed home for 2-3 weeks on his ""off time"" playing video games and watching TV. I would come home and clean up after him, doing all of the laundry, cleaning, maintenance. I paid all the bills and he used my car. We had sex 2+ times a day and I enthusiastically supported his disgusting and degrading fetishes. When he was on his trucking contracts, I would get his hotel information and send him pizzas, little Amazon packages to cheer him up, supported him emotionally, sexually, physically, and financially. I had never been ""in love"" before and I was determined to do anything to keep it. I didn't want kids but I was willing to have them for him.

Aaaand I found out he was on Tinder when he was trucking, fucking 20 and 21 year olds. He also had a bunch of excuses to go back to his home state (sick grandpa, sick mom) at which point I found out he was maintaining his relationship with his high school sweetheart, who he is still with to this day. So basically he was cheating **with** me, he was cheating **on** me, he was in ""long term relationships"" with multiple women because he, and I can say this earnestly, has no soul and no concept of how his actions affect anyone else.

One day I was cooking in the kitchen. We had the exact same iPhone with the exact same case (guess who paid for both!) that were charging on the counter (which was unusual because he was extremely secretive about his phone) and I went to check a recipe and I accidentally highlighted his screen instead. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica. Text after text after text from the same woman. 

I confronted him, he said it was a coworker. I said ""show me the texts"" and he said no. I said ""show me the texts or we're done"" and he said no. I found her on facebook (his facebook was always extremely limited -- another ongoing issue we always had) and asked her why she was texting my boyfriend. She said she was texting ***her*** boyfriend, and that he was away on work. They had met a few months previously, and he had been lying to her about building a future, that he was away on work and visiting his sick grandfather and his sick mother, but that he was living with her in Minneapolis. 

The heartbreaking part was that he was never actually going back. He was using her for money, emotional support, sexual gratification, sick mind games -- he was just using this poor girl. He preyed on weak, amenable, young girls who wanted to be loved so bad they would overlook his many (many, many) flaws. Like the quote says, ""when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags"". I made hundreds of excuses for him because I wanted to believe that I was worthy of love, and so did she (Jessica and I actually became friends after and she's doing really well now). 

After I kicked him out the day I found out about Jessica, I started to arm myself: with therapy, supportive friends, resources, knowledge. He, of course, wanted to work through it. He would go to therapy. He would go to couple's counseling. He would prove himself. He would change, and be better, and do better. I told him he had to figure out *why* he cheated. I had never been cheated on before then, and literally didn't understand the headspace of someone that would cheat. Why even be in a relationship? And in my mind, more importantly, **what did I do wrong?** How was I not good enough? I paid for everything, had sex with him constantly, made him my #1 priority in everything. **What could I have done better?**

I started reading countless books on infidelity, watched every YouTube video I could get my hands on, devoured podcasts and articles about the topic. What makes people cheat? The most conclusive answer I came up with is that infidelity is **never** the fault of the victim. You couldn't have been hotter, more accommodating, more pliable. Some people just hate themselves and that manifests is seeking constant approval, or they don't care about how their actions affect anyone else out of a deep rooted sense of entitlement. He never regretted his actions, he regretted his consequences.

The whole situation really damaged me in a lot of ways, but the person that I became (through my own strength, my resilience and my supportive friends) was stronger, more aware, more weary but also more trusting of my intuition. It made me realize that men don't care what you do for them. RPW think they can be the perfect housewife and they'll be rewarded the perfect man, but men don't value things they don't earn. If you're doing everything for him, cooking for him from jump, sexually available and accommodating too fast, he will not appreciate you or value you. In his mind, he **deserves** you to take care of him, because you don't value yourself and he doesn't value you either.

If I had taken my relationship with him slower, actually trusted my intuition, seen the red flags for what they were, and more importantly, **prioritized myself**, I never would have been so damaged. Honestly it probably would not have gone as far as it had because I would not have been an easy target for a manipulative liar. 

I beg the women of FDS, RPW, and women in general: **ALWAYS PUT YOURSELF FIRST.** You are the only person you will always have to rely on. If you are putting anyone (except your kids) ahead of yourself, you're investing in a future you can't control. You are worth being your #1 priority. See the red flags for what they are; don't be charmed by a man who promises the world without backing it up with actions. Protect yourself emotionally, physically, mentally. 

**A few random things I learned from this toxic relationship:**

* Don't trust someone who is extremely protective of their phone. I'm not saying you should go through it, but if he angles the screen away from you, always takes it with him (even to the bathroom), or won't even let you watch a video or something with him on his phone, he's hiding something.
* Same with social media. If he's extremely low key about his social media presence, never acknowledges your relationship, denies tags of you two together -- red fucking flag.
* If he lets you pay for his share of bills and expenses, he doesn't care if you respect him more than he values you monetarily. 
* Never, ever, ever send nudes. I've said this a hundred times in the sub but after I ended things, he (not subtly) threatened to send my many nudes that I had sent him to my friends and family as penance for my actions. 
* NEVER EVER EVER loan someone money. Don't pay emergency bills, don't even pay for things that are seemingly ""for your relationship"" (plane tickets, etc). You will NEVER see that money because a man who is such a bum to let you pay will never have the money to settle his debts.
* Teasing and joking in relationships is fine, but watch for the fine line between teasing and negging. If he pokes at your weaknesses and knows that it hurts you but does it anyway, he's manipulating you and keeping you emotionally off-balance. 
* Lastly, keep your head on a swivel. Be ruthless about identifying and addressing red flags early on. Trust your intuition, have supportive friends to act as sounding boards, and never just ""hope for the best"" when it comes to dealbreakers. All of my friends warned me about him, and in hindsight I thought they didn't understand, but looking back I realize now that they loved me more than he ever did.

ds7lkf,It's ok to judge a book by its cover.,"They tell you not to be so judgemental. 

""Give him a chance!""

""You really just have to get to know him!""

But what about when you can just see it? Or sense it?

The eyes give it away. I don't know about you all, but I can always see it in their goddamn eyes. 

I look in his eyes and I can nearly smell how foul he is inside. 

But he didn't say anything rude, he wasn't overtly mean. So, we're shallow if we judge based on what we see. If we are repelled, we're the badguy. We're supposed to be cheery, chatty, friendly, open minded, always smiling (I'm reminded of this one by men all the time).

Time and time again I have fallen into abusive relationships; friendly and romantic. My gut screams to me that they are bad news, but the voice society has reinforced into my brain says ""Aw, give the guy a chance. You don't even know him yet! He's a great guy deep down, but you gals won't even give him the time of day! Just be nice! Just chat with him! What's the harm in that? You just don't understand him.""

But these men use their words as a mask. Once he gets your attention, he'll try to cover what you could already see to begin with. He'll say anything to get what he wants--until his mask finally fades.

He's sweet, he's caring, and he's kind--until he's suddenly not. He loves you, he misses you, he just wants the best for you--until suddenly he doesn't. 

And then he hurts you. He hurts you with every weapon he's got. He lashes you with his hateful words. He stuns you with gaslighting. He screams the profanities you hate the most, he calls you a liar. He shatters your favorite coffee mug on the floor, he punches a hole in the wall just inches from your head. He grabs your wrists, pushes you down, and leaves you bruised and crying. He hurts you any way he can. All the while, he is the victim, of course. And he'll make sure you know that. 

How dare you guilt him with those tears? That's manipulative, you know. Those bruises are not his fault, you women are just too delicate! Calling you a b*tch? Well, you just simply deserved it. 

So, ladies, if I've learned anything in my adult life it is this. Listen to your gut. Judge that book by its cover. Judge it in any way you see fit. If you sense something is amiss, it might just be. 

You aren't shallow if you don't want a relationship with someone just based on what you see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ds7lkf/its_ok_to_judge_a_book_by_its_cover/,1572996881.0,82,0.87,15,FemaleDatingStrategy,ThinkTofu
ds6ozt,I dated a rich guy and screwed it up - a case study,"Hello all,

I wanted to outline a case study of my 6 month relationship with a millionaire, and how I screwed it up by being too much of a pickme. This ended up with me getting plated and my feelings and pride hurt. This was way before I ever found FDS, of course.

How things began:

I met Subject B on an online dating site (not an app) and did a few things right in the beginning. I wasn't terribly quick to respond, and I apparently came across as mysterious and aloof to him. Later, he admitted that he was intrigued by me and actually felt intimidated by my ""glamorous lifestyle"" (his words). I didn't know he was rich until our third date when he picked me up in a Porsche. I actually thought he was sorta nerdy and weird, which is why I was so aloof and distant in the beginning--and guess what? It drove him WILD.  He went far out of his way to impress me. By date three he was trying to get me to come over and cook me dinner--and I agreed. He clearly thought sex was going to happen, but I made out with him for a bit, then told him I needed to get home. The real reason I was being so weird? I was convinced he was going to be a terrible lay, so I delayed sex for two months. During these two months, he bought me gifts, took me to expensive restaurants, and lavished me with attention. I didn't seem bowled over or impressed by these overtures, which I think also made him go crazy. 

Where things went awry:

After I slept with him, I found out something I didn't expect--the dude was insanely good in the sack. And, I'll admit, he brought out a little bit of a sex kitten in me. I wanted to see him more. I started to ask *HIM* to get together before he asked me. I wanted to make sure I had him as often as I could. Then, I did something even dumber--we were having dinner, and he informed me that he'd disabled his dating profile. And I stupidly did the same thing without a commitment. I naively *assumed* that meant he was serious about me!! He even said he wanted to join me on my trip to Italy that I had planned in a few months!

I now think it was just a cheap manipulation to get me off the dating site, too. 

**Mistake #1** \- Got too sexual

**Mistake #2** \- Started asking him on dates

**Mistake #3** \- Disabled my dating profile and took myself off the market without an actual commitment

Things continued to devolve...

For the next few months, I continued to be the one proactively setting up dates with him. This was partly because of the sex, and also partly because at this juncture my anxiety had mounted. If I made plans with him, I didn't have to hand-wring about his interest, or so I thought. Surely, if he was accepting plans, that meant he was into me. Now, I realize that my anxiety was because I had put all my eggs in one basket without a commitment. Even worse, I started to nag him on whether he'd decided to join me in Italy.  He now was evading answering me or cagey about committing to it. 

**Mistake #4 -** Started nagging/seeming needy

The guy never came to Italy with me, obviously. You can sense where this is going. Things ferried along for a few more months, but then when I came back from Italy, I had a little bit of an emotional meltdown and warily asked him where it was going, expecting the worst.

His answer, ""*I just want to see where this goes...*""

You all can know where it goes. It continued to devolve until we just saw each other a few times a month. At the end, I realized....

ds0moq,Men actually like picky women,"
Notice how moids hate promiscuous women and want a woman who had a low number of partners or never had one at all? These women are the most picky and ""hypergamous"". They WANT this type of woman, they are only pissed off that they can‚Äôt attract one and so they lash out and claim that this behavior is unfair.

The reason why degenerate and unattractive males have subs like mgtow is because they secretly hope that women see their comments and change (LMAO). You see these pests spread their virus on every youtube video targeted towards women. If you are going your own way and are sooo happy then why do you invade female spaces? I thought you wanted nothing to do with women anymore? It‚Äôs not our fault if you‚Äôre of low value and lazy. These pests just want easy and free sex from women who are way more attractive than them.

They don‚Äôt like their fellow moids neither. Notice how they have a chad/virgin or alpha/beta ranking and group women together? It‚Äôs because men actually don‚Äôt get along and have to fight over status. The same thing can be observed in the animal kingdom. If a beta woke up as an alpha tomorrow he wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck about the betas anymore and their suffering. He‚Äòll probably enjoy it. If one of these low value males could attract a high value woman they would ditch their online communities and ""bros"" in a second and live their best life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ds0moq/men_actually_like_picky_women/,1572967374.0,101,0.83,29,FemaleDatingStrategy,throwaway7655679

Um.

That is behavior that should be _expected_‚Äîa given, a no brainer! The fact that a man has basic manners and treats you like a human being should not impress you! You should automatically expect that out of him, and if he doesn‚Äôt extend basic decency and respect to you, you should get up and leave.

The next time you find yourself ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù by a man‚Äôs behavior, evaluate whether it was _actually_ impressive (i.e. he did something extremely chivalrous and is going above and beyond to court you) OR if it‚Äôs just that your expectations and standards are extremely low.

Now, I understand. Many women‚Äôs expectations have been literally beaten into the ground by their past relationships, but honies, it‚Äôs time to raise the bar.

I‚Äôll tell you the secret: **A bunch of men pulled this shit completely out of their ass, stated it as fact, and acted entitled AF until they can bully enough women into agreeing to this nonsense.** 

&amp;nbsp;

They present it as reasonable and logical and/or use fear and dread tactics all day. This is all men have, because most of them struggle to entice women on their own merits. **MEN RELY ON FEAR TACTICS AND SLIGHT OF HAND TO FORCE WOMEN INTO COMPLIANCE.**

&amp;nbsp;

Men really have a lot of you trained to always think about what they think they‚Äôre ‚Äúowed‚Äù. You‚Äôre scared to ask a man to pay for a date because then he feels like he‚Äôs ‚Äúowed‚Äù sex. SO FUCKING WHAT?

&amp;nbsp;

YOU do NOT owe a man JACK SHIT!

&amp;nbsp;

Men think they‚Äôre entitled to sex after 3 dates but don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre entitled to a text back the next day, and definitely not a relationship - so why do you give a shit about what they think they‚Äôre entitled to? You ask a man to display common courtesy these days and he‚Äôll label you ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and ‚Äúclingy‚Äù because having to treat women like human beings is a massive inconvenience.

&amp;nbsp;

Understand this fact: Men prioritize and legitimize their wants, desires, and needs above all else and do not give a single solitary shit about what women think they‚Äôre owed. 


&amp;nbsp;

Until you break out of seeing yourself through the male gaze and your life through male wants and needs you will **NEVER** be happy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Men continuously push the needle in their direction with their audacious and disrespectful demands while women are still out here running in circles worried about ‚Äúequality‚Äù and what‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù. Please. 


&amp;nbsp;

So As long as men are creating bullshit expectations about what they‚Äôre ‚Äúowed‚Äù, why not create your own?  

&amp;nbsp;

I think I‚Äôm owed $200 dinner dates and paid vacation weekends. Fuck it, I think I‚Äôm owed a giraffe. Pick what you want and *assume* you are entitled to that and STAY on your script!

&amp;nbsp; 

 If at any point men in your space act like they‚Äôre owed something in return just act ‚Äúconfused‚Äù AF like you didn‚Äôt know. Men have playing STUPID AF about women‚Äôs wants and needs down to an art form. What better way is there to dodge accountability?  Tell them what you expect and if they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt provide it, treat them with contempt and then let them go.

dr4c3y,STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM!,"I see this so fucking often with my girlfriends. Women are so naturally empathetic and understanding, so we‚Äôve been conditioned to look past or excuse away bad behaviors because we want to see the best in people, want to ‚Äúsave‚Äù men from themselves, and think that if we rescue him, he will love us. Nah, sis. Fucking stop that.

**Here are the most common excuses I see and how to confront them:**

**‚ÄúHe has trust issues because he‚Äôs been cheated on before!‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs emotionally unavailable because he‚Äôs been hurt by his ex‚Äù -** Yeah, that‚Äôs rough. But honestly, who hasn‚Äôt? If he is using that as an excuse to put up walls or not commit to you, that‚Äôs not your problem. You didn‚Äôt cheat on him. If he‚Äôs not in a place to trust or work through these issues, wtf is he doing wasting your time? Why is he on OLD apps? He just wants his needs met without doing the work to address his trust issues and that‚Äôs not your problem. Plus trust issues can only be resolved from within. You‚Äôll never ‚Äúprove‚Äù yourself to someone who is determined not to trust. **If he can't trust, why is he wasting your time???**

**‚ÄúBut he has anxiety/depression/PTSD!‚Äù -** Yeahhhh but who doesn‚Äôt these days? Using mental health as an excuse in relationships means you‚Äôre **NOT READY FOR  RELATIONSHIPS. PERIOD**. If their social anxiety prevents them from being there for their partner or if their depression is keeping them from being a *good* partner, they need to **WORK ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH**. Putting that on the person you‚Äôre dating, especially in new relationships, is toxic as fuck and should tell you that they will always put their mental health on you. When people mention in their OLD profile or within the first few days that they have unmanaged mental health, run the opposite direction. Listen, I have anxiety/depression/OCD/trauma, but I manage it through diet, medication, cognitive therapy, environmental management, and self-improvement. I do NOT make it my partner‚Äôs responsibility to manage my symptoms or make up for my lack of effort. Men are way way way more likely to do this than women, as men are taught to rely solely on their partner for their emotional needs instead of seeking out actual therapy, finding support among friends, or seeking medication.

**‚ÄúHe had a difficult childhood! He was abused!‚Äù -** That wasn‚Äôt his fault, but healing is his responsibility. You are not his therapist, you are not his replacement mommy. You can‚Äôt undo his trauma, and if he‚Äôs using his childhood as an excuse to not do X or Y, he‚Äôs not ready for a relationship. Period.

**‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in a bad marriage, but he will leave her eventually‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the middle of a divorce‚Äù -** Girl you‚Äôre stupid. Even if he is in the process of ending his marriage, why would you want to go all-in on someone who obviously has some shit to work through? Go find someone, you know, actually single.

**‚ÄúHe‚Äôs between jobs/he keeps getting taken advantage of financially/he just needs money to get on his feet‚Äù -** UGH this one drives me crazy. As someone who has been financially taken advantage of by multiple men in the past, we always want to assume they‚Äôre working their hardest (like we are) and are just down on their luck. If he‚Äôs disclosing financial problems to you early in a relationship, that‚Äôs his homeostasis, girl. He is a permanent struggle, and will rely on you and take advantage of you as much as he can. No. Never, ever, ever loan or give money to a man, pay his bills, let him stay with you, etc. Fucking no.

**""If I just support him as he works on his career/gets through school, he will help me out later"" -** Nah, he will upgrade for a hotter, younger woman who isn't a doormat once he's successful. You should always be your #1 priority.

**""He isn't texting me back/planning dates/making time for me because he's really busy right now"" -** Uhhh then why is he dating you? If his work is so busy that he doesn't have time to send you a text in the 24 hours we have in a day, why is he dating? Why are you entertaining this? Let him know to hit you up when he's ready for a relationship because that time is not now.

**""He yells/gets in my face/belittles me because that's how his mom/dad treated him"" -** Never, ever, ever, ever accept abuse. Ever.

We women are completely responsible for our own mental health, and then take on the mental health of people who don't want to put in the work. This needs to stop. Yes you can grow together as people and as a couple, but that is not a replacement for his own self-improvement. And men who don't seek therapy or their own betterment will never do it for your relationship. If you won't change for yourself, you won't change for someone else. Period.

This is such a knee-jerk response from men when confronted with women who don't care about being married or otherwise saddled with a male half. 

The stats speak for themselves. Best case scenario, the woman will outlive the man in a long term marriage...and she will be his caregiver until he is dead. 

Or worse, the wife gets sick and to the SHOCK OF NOBODY, the couple will divorce because men fucking suck. So she ends up alone...after dealing with the illness and the selfish POS husband.

Also, married men report the most happiness. Single women report the most happiness. Single men and MARRIED WOMEN report the most unhappiness.

dqkxrc,I'm learning how to hold myself outside of the male gaze,"It's finally my time.  I turned 40 this year, I don't' feel like I hit a wall - rather I hit my tailwind.  I just don't give a fuck anymore what men (and even my husband) find attractive or necessary for a woman to do.  

I stopped shaving my legs, not out of anger but just because I find it tiresome.  And frankly, it feels really nice to feel the wind in my leg hair.   On Monday, they are going to take my IUD out and I'm not replacing it with anything.  Fuck it, I've been on birth control since I was 18.  I'm going to love my body as a perfect vessel to get me through this life.  My feet are large (size 10), they are perfectly proportionate for my height.  My belly is soft and warm, my thighs are strong, my face has smile wrinkles.  These are signs of a life well-lived, not something to be hidden, injected, or surgically removed.   Finally, I'm not going to hide my cleavage for the sake of false modesty.  For too long, I have been sexualized for my genetics, either by men leering or by fellow women judging.  These are my breasts.  I like them.  They are passed to me by my mother and grandmother just as much as my other hereditary traits.  

If I can communicate anything to the younger generation of amazing women coming up, it would be this.  Don't wait until you're 40.  Be exactly who you are right now and screw anyone who wants to put you in a box.  You are not a prize to be won and kept dusty in a showroom.  Walk away from anyone who puts demands on your body, your time, your intuition.  Keep your standards high.

FWIW, I did have this conversation with my husband when he asked why I stopped shaving.  We had a drawn-out discussion about my reasoning and while he said he doesn't find it attractive, he acknowledged that it was his social conditioning and said he doesn't find it unattractive either.  I pointed out that I make no demands on his body or shaving rituals, and this small act has major reverberations in the way I view my place in the world - on my terms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dqkxrc/im_learning_how_to_hold_myself_outside_of_the/,1572705082.0,118,0.8,15,FemaleDatingStrategy,FuturePigeon
dqghzn,This sub saved me from myself," Hey! I know this is probably out of topic, but I wanted to tell you all how this community helped me!

 Long story short, I'm only 23 and I'm not really into having sex without being comfortable and at the very least exclusive. I only had sex with one person (my long term bf at the time) about 3 years ago. Since then, guys have asked me out and flirted with me. I even dated a couple, but, as most guys my age, they always expected sex asap, so I always ended it.

 The thing is, I started to get lonely, so I talked to some friends for advice and they all told me I was insane for not dating casually first, have sex and then see if that leads to something, that I should lower my standars and see guys personalities and that I really should download tinder (fyi in my country its used 98% for just sex).
 This threw me off a little bit, so I searched for answers from male subs ( I know, huge mistake) and they all said the same my friends did, ""if we don't have sex after the 3rd to 5th date, its over"" and ""yes, I love when girls ask me out"". So, being the idiot I am, I decided to give it a try.
 I liked a guy (average, but with a ""good personality"") and I asked him out, texted him, made plans, etc. Not only did he suddenly started to act like he was the price and I should do everything in my power to gain his approval (when before that he always texted first, approached me, complimented me and generally pinned after me ), but I have never in my life felt so ugly and insecure. Thankfully, that went nowhere, but all my friends insisted I should at least try to have casual sex to see if I liked it. This really isn't in my nature, but really, I felt like this was the only way to have a relationship and it apparently worked for everyone I know and trust.  

 So, I was really starting to consider it and even trying to hype myself to do it thinking ""its the normal thing to do, not just being used. If not now, when?"". But while lurking r/vindicta to better myself, I stumbled upon this place.
 Seriously, guys, thank you. Its like I was in a dazed state fuelled by feeling inadequate in the modern dating world. I finally see that I should keep my boundaries and how truly toxic that way of thinking was for me.

Sorry for the long rant, but I'm grateful that I found this place when I did and hope I can be part of the community ‚ù§

dqayo7,Why FDS is NOT about 'goldigging',"*In response to a post claiming FDS is 'disgusting' and full of goldiggers:*

Why is it 'goldigging' when an attractive young woman who is educated /has her own money wants a competent man that can financially provide? Internalised misogyny? Resentment of women who know their worth? Real goldiggers are ONLY interested in getting the money/lifestyle, not whether the man is going to treat them right &amp; they usually seek men that are on the verge of death. We are looking for competent mature loyal men who are generous &amp; take care of the people closest to them (including their kids/wife)...no one is advocating to solely rely on a mans finances since we *have our own.* FDS stresses *the importance of having your own.* We know it is not sensible to rely on a mans finances like a helpless child.

Do these people claiming we are evil 'goldiggers' know that financial issues are the NO1 REASON for divorce in the US?

So if you're with someone that has lax/immature attitudes to spending/is a low earner with no (evident) plans to ease the burden off you as a hardworking breadwinner mother....don't you think that might cause some heated arguments between you both? Wouldn't that cause friction that could possibly erupt into a broken home? Get real here people. Love doesn't pay for your children's daycare fees does it? Verbal flattery from your husband won't pay for your kids college tuition, it won't pay for your health bills if you get sick. It takes a lot of money to raise kids &amp; you are going to feel overwhelmed settling for a broke man as a working mother.

If I'm going to take a pay hit to a lucrative career whilst having children, then I'm going to need a reasonable unselfish man who has me covered so everything is smooth sailing...particularly if we want multiple kids, with multiple mouths to feed. I don't want to be working 50 hrs a week in a high stress job whilst cooking , cleaning, doing the laundry, running after the kids etc whilst the man comes in and slumps his ass on the couch from his low paid job, leaving it all to me. Most low earning men I see, with breadwinner female partners, have ZERO desire to advance their pay/careers through education or qualifications....they are perfectly complacent &amp; comfortable with the set up because old girl is doing *everything for him*. Old girl is shouldering MOST of the weight, and she thought it was fine to enter a relationship this way, she thought she could 'do it all' herself &amp; was 'playing it fair'.  I don't believe this is fair or balanced...I don't believe that is what true  'equality' looks like....it looks like a man slacking off, taking the piss and using his wife as a donkey.

Why does an educated woman with money have to settle for nit picking broke men, since we all know broke nit picking selfish men are rather partial to emotionally manipulating women so they can financially leech off her hardwork and reap the benefits of dumping domestic duties onto their wifes saddled back? Those pay half men are some of the most awful I've come across, they *still* feel entitled to sex after the first date,. And many of them -as soon as you try to cater to them by playing fair- will start seeing just how far they can push/exploit you...and will reveal themselves to inhabit various unattractive qualities such as immaturity/money issues/alcoholism. *Woops baby I blew my money on booze again because of \*insert something about childhood/mental health\* can you throw me some cash to drown my sorrows?!! Pwetty pweez you know I'm broken, I won't do it again, I'm just SO skint!!* No, no I bloody well can't. You see these types of dynamics ALL the time, these pay half women are constantly being exploited, because they set the dynamic up so wrong from the start, they didn't think about how much women already OVER invest into pleasing men. Men already reap too much from women with little gratitude, expecting a man to be financially competent is not *'setting the bar too high' or being a goldigger,* its perfectly reasonable for a woman wanting the most stable environment for herself.

Sorry but we really aren't bothered if the dusties don't like us here at FDS.....but they can stop misrepresenting our values in a bid to smear what is really time tested COMMON SENSE, what is really traditional dating advice passed down from our ancestors. A woman wanting a generous, mature, financially competent partner  is not 'goldigging' when she has already established herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dqayo7/why_fds_is_not_about_goldigging/,1572644829.0,70,0.76,6,FemaleDatingStrategy,modernmedusaa
dqav8s,Do NOT date men who sexualises women/women relationships.,"Hey, bisexual women or women who are experimenting with their own sexuality,  I'm talking about YOUR past relationships. Your meaningful, important past relationships with women you have loved, respect or had feelings for. If you ever bring up your previous relationship with women and he sexualises you or your sexual preferences, especially when specifically makes remarks about injecting himself into his ideas of the ""bisexual unicorn that will let me fuck her and her hot side girlfriend"" fantasy, I can't stress this enough but **DUMP HIM.**

**He is hoping you bring your sexuality into the relationship while he provides nothing to the table. You are NOT his sex puppet. Don't be ashamed to bring it up to see how he reacts. Men that respect women will treat it exactly the same as a woman/male relationship, non-sexists will place the value of two women being together and treat it seriously. Sexists will immediately fetishize your relationships because they don't see the value of female/female relationships unless it plays into his sexual fantasies.**

You are NOT a sexual object, your former relationships arent a sexual object, you should never degrade yourself, or your past lovers over someone that disregards female relationships because it makes his ""peepee hurd"". You are all women that need respect, you are both people. Don't allow men to look at you as a sexual object. I understand it might be hot to imagine a woman you like making out with another woman if your head is in porno land, but trust me, a lot of women aren't getting lady boners over their boyfriends making out with another hot man or would want that to happen.

Another red flag is if men don't see you kissing, developing feelings or having sex with another woman as cheating. That means he isn't looking at you both as individuals, rather, he is placing you as an object. Try kissing or having sex with another man, let's see how hot he gets thinking of you going down a hot guys dick that isn't his. Yeah, not so happy now right?

TLDR: Dump him if he sexualises female/female relationships, it is the ultimate mark of a sexist, because he places women below men.

dpqqc4,You need to respect your man.,"And by that, I mean you need to be with a man that *you* respect, because if you can't respect him, you will resent him and/or become disgusted with him. 

It's hard to respect someone that doesn't respect you, and if you are someone with very low self worth, you need to be able to answer ""yes"" to the question of, ""would I ever talk to or treat someone the way that he treats me?"". Even if a part of you is blind to yourself being mistreated, or you rationalize/justify yourself being mistreated, surely you can still recognize whether or not you would treat someone else the same way you are being treated under the same circumstances.

As an example, if a man you are with is talking about how hot other girls are in front of you and bragging about how they are checking him out, you might want to rationalize and make excuses for him, but if you consider that you wouldn't be okay seeing someone do that to your friend, nor would you ever try to say similar things to your man knowing that it could make him insecure, you can deduce from his actions that he is not being respectful, and therefore is not someone you can respect as your man.

dpmx1j,"Never let him ""talk you into"" sex.","Never, at any point, should a man ***convince you*** to have sex. The amount of men that have done verbal gymnastics to try and get me to have sex when I either haven't wanted to, wasn't in the mood, or wasn't in the mood *for them* is fucking mindblowing. Back before I had a backbone, I was occasionally convinced and always, always, always regretted it.

Please, for the love of god, if you are not 100% fully on board, don't have sex with him.

Don't have sex to keep him interested.

Don't have sex to be polite. 

Don't have sex to get attention.

Don't have sex out of pity or guilt.

Don't have sex because you feel like you should.

Don't have sex because he says he loves you or sees a future with you if he hasn't actually proven this with actions.

Most men would never debase themselves to have sex with someone they weren't attracted to out of some misguided effort to be polite or help some woman's ego, and neither should you. And sex is almost always completely for the man's benefit, as most are selfish and don't care if you get off if they don't care about you. And if he's pressuring you sis, he doesn't give a fuck about you and will be a bad lay regardless.

Learn from my mistake: I once hooked up with a guy because I felt bad for him. We matched on OLD, he seemed nice enough but gave me some sob story about how he's lonely and just wanted to ""cuddle"". I let him come over and he immediately started pressuring me for more. I didn't have tough skin at the time and have always been a people pleaser, so I went farther than I wanted to. Afterword, he blocked me on the OLD and text. It was humiliating and hurtful, and I was angry at him but I was more angry at myself because I didn't respect myself enough to stick up for me and stand by my own boundaries and advocate for my own comfort. This isn't my proudest moment and I'm embarrassed to share it, but honestly I have other personal stories of coercion and actual rape from men who didn't care about my boundaries, comfort or safety as I'm sure most of us do.

""No."" is a complete sentence. Don't have sex until you want to, and not until he's proven himself worthy.

What‚Äôs the point of blocking men from participating when we continuously link their rage filled circle jerks into our precious sub?

We always check (with love) a fellow queen when she‚Äôs entertaining a fuckboy with her replies. We need to do the same with the crying, bitter, fragile manosphere. Or at least the incels for godsake. 

Incels will always be mad no matter what. They can‚Äôt even get a low value woman to look their way. Their opinions mean shit. 

Normie men are mad because their negging, manipulations and marriage to being perpetually low effort will be less likely to work on women if more women uphold FDS values.

High value men (and honestly most men) already knew the name of the game before this sub got popular. True high value men are unbothered because they‚Äôve *been* courting women properly.  Like, it‚Äôs legitimately nothing new.

dp9fj3,That time a man made a clown out of me: lessons to learn from my personal experience,"This is long, but worth the read and hopefully some of you ladies out there reading this won‚Äôt make the same dumb ass mistakes I made. I have since grown up and I‚Äôm engaged to be married to a wonderful man who treats me like the absolute queen that I am.

Three years ago I matched with this guy George on tinder. We got to chatting and found out we worked in the same hospital. I was a med-surg nurse and he was a pediatric resident so it was unlikely that we would have ever crossed paths naturally because he worked with children and I worked with adults. It was sooo great to meet someone who was handsome, educated, and had a good career.

I played by ‚ÄúThe Rules‚Äù... I never texted/called first, I never initiated dates, I never paid on said dates, I didn‚Äôt talk too much, and I didn‚Äôt hang out with him too much so that I could leave him wanting more. It was kind of easy to do because in addition to nursing, I also worked as a bartender on the weekends for extra money, and I hung out with my girlfriends. I was busy. This man wasn‚Äôt my whole life. 

An important detail worth mentioning is that we were both from the same country and we had the same values and understood the culture. However, I was a US citizen and George was not. He was in the US on a resident physician visa. 

Anyway, so my family loved George and my father treated him like a son. He would take me out to fancy dinners and clubs and pay for everything. He would take me shopping in NYC and would spoil me with gifts (gifts that I *never* asked for, he would just buy me stuff). But then I got too comfortable and slowly started breaking the rules. He gave me a key to his apartment and on my days off, I would hang out there, clean, cook, and do his laundry and dishes. I felt like it was the least I could do to help because he was working 14hr days and he spoiled me so much. I spent the night there a few times a week. I knew I was breaking the rules, and for a second I thought that I should pull back and stop hanging around too much or else it will bite me in the ass. But then he found out he was chosen for a fellowship in Miami starting in July and he asked me to move there with him. I was ecstatic. Then he asked to take me to our country for Christmas so that I could meet his family. I thought, wow, this is it. This is the man I‚Äôm going to marry.

We went and that‚Äôs when I realized that George‚Äôs father was a really big deal in our country. He was a highly revered military doctor and they lived in a mansion in the nicest neighborhood of the city center. They drove nice cars. His mom was a stay at home wife. We spent a couple nights with his parents, and then we stayed in their second vacation home by ourselves after that. 

But everything changed for the worse while we were there. He was always demanding that we hang out with all his friends, classmates, and cousins, but he never wanted to hang out with my cousins, saying that *he* paid for the trip so we were going to do whatever *he* wanted. I figured we came all this way and we were going to be there for three weeks, we could spare ONE night to have dinner with my cousins so they could meet him. He made me cry multiple times. We fought half the time we were there. I forced him to have dinner with my cousins, and afterwards he told me they were annoying and that he didn‚Äôt want to hang out with them again. When we went to stay at a hotel in the mountains, he asked me to pay for it because ‚Äúhe forgot his credit card.‚Äù So my dumb ass paid because I didn‚Äôt want to be stranded in the cold mountains with no place to go. I should have dumped him when we got back, but I was so blinded by love, I stuck around.

One night, we were talking about previous relationships and I mentioned that I used to date another resident a year prior, but it didn‚Äôt work out because he was afraid of commitment and he was a surgeon and always on call and the timing just wasn‚Äôt right. Then George said ‚ÄúYou used to date another resident? Wow. Are you doctor shopping?‚Äù I broke down into tears because he was insinuating that I was a gold-digger. I told him that I met my ex at my bartending job and that he was my customer and that I had no idea he was even a doctor until our first date. It wasn‚Äôt like I was fishing for doctors. Even when I matched with George on tinder, I had no idea he was a doctor because he didn‚Äôt list that in his bio. I swiped right purely because of looks. I called him an asshole and left. The next day he showed up with expensive jewelry as an apology and admitted that he was an asshole for what he said. So I stayed with him, even though I should have ended it.

Soon after, George told me how stressed out he was because his residency was ending in June and he wasn‚Äôt sure how he was going to be able to afford living in Miami. He told me he was having money problems. When I asked him how he was able to afford all the fancy restaurants, clubs, and shopping, he said **his dad gave him an allowance every month.** His dad also paid his rent every month too, and even bought him the Lexus he was driving around. So basically he was broke. Residents don‚Äôt make a lot of money. He was making under $40k/year, and he resented me because I was making double that as a nurse, plus an extra $1000 on the weekends I would bartend. He would say degrading things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a doctor. I should be making more money than you. You‚Äôre just a bartender,‚Äù basically minimizing all the hard work I do as a nurse, just because my side hustle was bartending. 

At this point, he was also getting on my nerves because he was pressuring me do things that made me uncomfortable sexually. He was always begging me to do anal and sometimes he would try to slip it in ‚Äúaccidentally.‚Äù Then when we were working at the hospital on the same days, he would try to get me to fuck him in the on-call resident room on my lunch break, which terrified me because it was just a bunch of twin-sized cots in an open room and the door didn‚Äôt lock. Anyone could have walked in and I could have been fired. Sometimes when he was working overnight, he would call me and say ‚Äúcome to the residents room, no one is here right now.‚Äù I never did it for fear of being caught, but it was still humiliating. 

Then he started demanding that I pay for everything since I made more money. I was stupid and agreed to it. In addition to all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry I was already doing, I started paying every time we would go out. His friends came from Europe to visit us, so he asked me to leave and stay with my parents during that time so that his friends could sleep in our bedroom and he would sleep on the couch in the living room. I figured, okay, that‚Äôs fine. Four people in a one bedroom apartment sharing one bathroom would be really tight. So I was happy to go back to my own room and bathroom at my parents‚Äô house. But then he told me to give my key back to give to his visitors so that they could come and go as they pleased. I reluctantly gave George my key back. 

While his friends were here, we went to NYC so they could do touristy things. George wanted to go to a nightclub, but there was an $80 cover charge to get in. He asked me to pay for it, but I said no. He said ‚Äúwhy not? You can afford it.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI know I can, but it‚Äôs not my choice to come here. We can go to another club that doesn‚Äôt have a cover. It also was not my choice to go to this expensive French restaurant or to stay in a hotel that costs $450/night. That‚Äôs on you. You know you‚Äôre short on money, so why would you choose to do expensive things?‚Äù We fought about that in the middle of the street until his friends offered to pay for his cover charge. I went back to the hotel room without him and cried. I never got the apartment key back, even after his friends went back to Europe. George kept saying ‚Äúhe lost it somewhere in the apartment and couldn‚Äôt find it.‚ÄùMajor red flag. 

The whole time my parents were saying to be patient and wait it out, that everything would get better and George wouldn‚Äôt be so stressed out when we moved and he was making more money. But I was truly depressed and unhappy. And just as I was going to bring myself to break up with him, George suggested we look for a new apartment in Miami, which lifted my spirits back up again. So we browsed online and George was suggesting all these crazy expensive apartments that are in waterfront high rises in downtown Miami. His favorite one was $4200/month plus extra for parking. I asked him how were we going to afford this? He said ‚Äúwell you can pay for it, can‚Äôt you?‚Äù I said no, I wouldn‚Äôt. If he wanted me to pay, then it would be something that I picked that was less money. I found an amazing fully furnished 2 bed, 2 bath home, close to public transit, it had a private driveway and garage at half the price. But he said he didn‚Äôt like it because it didn‚Äôt have a pool. I said beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. We argued for days about it. Finally we agreed on a studio apartment in a high rise. It was $2400/month and and he would pay for the parking separately.

He said he would go to Miami to tour a few places before signing any contracts. He booked a flight and left without telling me. I was heartbroken because I wanted to go tour them together. The entire time he was gone, he wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls or texts. I was 1000 miles away calling realtors in Miami setting up all these appointments for his apartment tours and he flat out ghosted me. He came home two days later than he said he would. 

When I confronted him, he said that he was busy running around with realtors and that he also met his new boss and toured the hospital and didn‚Äôt have service. Riiiiiight. A likely story. Then he said ‚Äúgood news though, I found an apartment. But they want first month, last month, and security.‚Äù In total, it was $8500. Of course, he didn‚Äôt have it. He asked me for it. So I wrote out a check for $8500, but I didn‚Äôt give it to him right away.

Y‚Äôall... I really do believe in God. Because the day before I was going to give him the check, I found out he had been cheating on me with another nurse and the reason he was dodging my calls while he was in Miami was because he was down there WITH HER touring all the apartments that I had picked out!! Apparently she worked in the newborn nursery overnight, which is how they met and also why I‚Äôve never seen her or heard of her. She was engaged and was cheating on her fianc√© with George. And yes, she knew about me, but George lied to her and told her that we had broken up months prior. She even posted a picture on her public Instagram of them together on the beach in Miami saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to get an apartment with you!!‚Äù I confronted her and wrote to her telling her everything, but she left me on read. She didn‚Äôt care. 

It all came crashing down and everything finally started making sense. It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt have money... he just couldn‚Äôt afford having two girlfriends because his daddy‚Äôs allowance wasn‚Äôt enough to cover everything. He had been cheating on me for several months. I guess he realized that he wasn‚Äôt going to milk me for my money and he found this home-wrecker, who I assume makes about the same money as me since we were both nurses in the same hospital. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she was the one who paid the $8500 deposit for the new apartment. My dad was more upset and disgusted than I was. He thought that maybe George was looking for a green card. 

Fast forward a couple months.. I found out that George and the other girl got married. Which confirmed my father‚Äôs suspicions because George‚Äôs visa was going to expire and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get another J-visa. Even though he was starting a fellowship, he couldn‚Äôt get another visa because the fellowship had to be in ‚Äúan area of need‚Äù and Miami is not considered an area of need. So he married this girl right before his visa was due to expire.

So what did I learn from all of this?
1. Never pay FOR ANYTHING. If a guy plans something, he should be the one who pays. If he wants to go to expensive restaurants, clubs, and shows, he pays, not you.
2. Never move in with a man, or uproot your life for a man unless there is a formal commitment (engagement ring).
3. Never tolerate any insults or degrading comments from a man. 
4. Never feel bad that you make more money than your man. As the wise Miranda Hobbes once said, ‚ÄúI want to enjoy my success, not apologize for it.‚Äù
5. Never tolerate a man who leaves without telling you and ghosts you. 
6. Never date a man who expects you to do things that make you uncomfortable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dp9fj3/that_time_a_man_made_a_clown_out_of_me_lessons_to/,1572454806.0,98,0.88,10,FemaleDatingStrategy,eatapeach18

dp6nrk,Always have your own money regardless,"Even if you find a rich man and he's willing to provide for you, still have savings and your own money in the bank. I'm telling you this because I've heard countless stories of women whose men are fully providing for them who end up being totally financially dependent on them. Then when these men start treating them badly and losing respect for them these women have no where to go because they have no savings, no family or friend support and no professional value in the market.

Learn the difference between a man providing for you but being supportive of you having your goals and your own financial independence and financial abuse which yes, is a thing and usually a part or a predecessor to other types of abuse.

More recently I got to know that a girl I know who I thought was living the life with her millionaire boyfriend is actually living a nightmare and can't get out. Her boyfriend (fiance now but not really taking any steps to actually marrying her) made her stop working and fully provided for her but has made her life a living hell. Is abusive, as isolated her from everyone and won't let her get a job without screaming and shutting her down. He belittles her and is downright disgusting and disrespectful towards her. 

His latest was to open a cafe and having her work there to shut her up about him not letting her work... but the best is that he didn't even give her a contract and simply lets her use HIS card for what she wants as payment. Not an actually salary, not paying taxes, not having her own without him controlling her expenses. And the saddest part is that he says the cafe belongs to both of them and that she's the boss there but her name is nowhere in the business nor in anything like house or even the cars he gives her. A full mess and she won't leave because she says ""I won't leave with nothing, I must get something"". Sis, you own nothing at this point, no savings, no nothing, do you think you're really getting something when you leave if nothing is even in your name?

Don't take bums who want to live off you but also don't take men who want to provide for you in a way that they end up having total financial power over you preventing you of getting out if you want.

dojvku,Rant: Stop making excuses for dusty ass losers,"There is an epidemic in my friend group. I have several amazing, beautiful, funny, intelligent friends who are settling for, and I mean this sincerely, hot trash garbage men. They're non-committal, time wasting, useless, boring, unattractive scumbags, and I'm SO FUCKING SICK OF IT. 

Take my one friend T., for example. She's amazing. She's been with this guy for two years, and he has never, not for one fucking day, taken her or their relationship seriously. She's early 30's, he's mid 40's. He has an extremely demanding career that takes him out of the country, but when he IS in town he's putting his family, his sports, his hobbies, literally ANYTHING ahead of her. He cancels plans last minute, leaves her hanging for social events that she plans months in advance, like I'm truly baffled at why this successful and strong woman is dealing with this trifling trash. But she also makes a million and a half excuses for him. ""he's going through a lot right now"" (he has been since day 1!), ""he needs to put his career first"" (you're not even 5th in his list of priorities!), ""he will take our relationship more seriously when thing settle down"" (they will NEVER settle down). She is wasting her pretty years on someone who will never care, and she refuses to hear it. 

Ladies, STOP MAKING FUCKING EXCUSES FOR THESE MEN! Fucking LISTEN:

* It doesn't MATTER if he's been ""hurt before"", HE needs to take responsibility for his hurts and traumas, just like we do. WE don't go around blaming every man for our hurts/rapes/abuses/generational abuse. If he's not going to improve for himself, he won't do it for you. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS TRAUMAS. 
* If he's not putting your relationship as a priority, he doesn't want to be with you. Period. Full stop. Men work for what they don't want to lose, and if you make yourself incredibly available, he won't give a fuck how you feel because he knows he can breadcrumb you and keep you on the line. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIS LACK OF EFFORT.
* If he cannot seem to get his shit together, he's lazy or stupid or both. I don't give a fuck what you think his potential is, or how great he could be if he applied himself. Potential without action is fucking nothing. If he wastes his money on video games and weed, lives with his parents, or does hood rat shit with his friends instead of securing a good future for himself, FUCKING DROP HIM. HE IS NOT AN ADULT WORTH PURSUING.
* If he doesn't maintain regular communication with you, fucking drop him. Don't wait around for him to be communicative because if he liked you, he wouldn't be able to get enough of you. Don't try and convince him to be more attentive, don't tell him you ""need more"". He knows, he just doesn't fucking care. 
* Stop condescending these fucking hoe men and acting as if they just need a little of your TLC to become better. No, they need to work harder. They need to stop being fucking babies and take responsibility for their lives. You are not his mommy, you are not his therapist. Don't take on his emotional labor just because you think he's a poor widdle ickle sweetie boy. Fucking drop him. Find a man who is working on himself. You will never change someone who isn't willing to do the work for themselves.

dohevr,"Just realized some guys I thought we were my friends ""negged"" me and destroyed my mental health","THANKS to FDS, I finally realized why I went from a queen of confidence to a freaking mental-health wreck! 

I worked so damn hard for a whole year to improve my fitness, appearance, personality, career. I honestly had so much going for me and I was at the top of my game / world.  I was so happy and nothing in the world could destroy me.  If some inconveniences happened, I'd know to forgive and let go.  I was a really really happy person. 

\--- 

Long story short, I met this guy, and tbh I many levels above him.  The only reason I agreed to go out with him is because we had a few mutual friends and I just wanted to make a friend since it seemed like we had common interests.  I really didn't see him as a potential at all - he was completely **not** my type. 

Looking back, he had used EVERY. SINGLE. NEGGING. TACTIC. in the book to bring me down, destroy myself esteem, make me feel like I had to win HIS affection.  He'd find every single opportunity when we'd speak to absolutely belittle me and my accomplishments. I think his toxic philosophies spread like a disease because I now realized that the other males in ""our circle"" would do similar things to me. 

\---

Overtime, I started to feel really disturbed hanging out in a group with them - and honestly I didn't even know why! All I knew was that I started to withdraw from them after a while.  I now realize that every time we hung out, they'd knock down the self-esteem I worked so hard to build little by little, and constantly made me feel inadequate.

So this is how trash men who aren't sh!t tries to get into your pants / on your favorable side?

docr91,Thank you for your wisdom. I am sorry.,"Posting from an alt because I expect to be hastily banned. I am a 27 year old man in California. This will be my only post here.

Thank you for this Sub. I was so bothered to read this stuff on here at first. I never understood the revulsion women had to TRP and now I do. And now this sub doesn't bother me. 

I was the guy you complain about. The one who manipulated and gaslighted and did whatever it took to keep you around. It made me feel safe; like you wouldn't leave me. Like you would be who I wanted you to be. 

I didn't even know I was doing it until one day my world broke due to my dickery and douchbaggary. She became herself again. She left to return home to her family across state lines. And I lost the love of a very lovely, loving person. I didn't deserve her love. She didn't deserve the way I treated her.

The red flags you talk about are real. The manipulative behaviors by whatever guys like me are are real. The mechanisms by which they work are real.

I am working on purging that shit from my soul. I hope it works, because fear of abandonment, narcissistic solipsism, and anxiety manifested in anger and control seeking are not a way of having a fulfilling relationship. And they certainly are not your burden to deal with.

I hope you find what you are looking for. I hope you don't ever meet a guy like me again, and if you do, I hope you run as soon as you see those redflags.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/docr91/thank_you_for_your_wisdom_i_am_sorry/,1572286644.0,423,0.7,73,FemaleDatingStrategy,lostoldpassword

do8wn7,"Your WCW Doesn't Even Exist - ""The Wall"" and Other Lies","‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù has always been a morbidly fascinating and hilarious concept to me. In real life, I very rarely meet a woman in her 30‚Äôs that is immediately distinguishable from one in her mid-late twenties. Men are even more useless at guessing than other women are. The notion that we immediately explode into a pile of gray hairs and wrinkly skin on our 30th birthday should be laughable to any boy over the age of 13, yet, this concept of ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù gets parroted by bitter Reddit losers as gospel.

A few years ago, I dated this guy. His cousin was literally a supermodel. Like, a shot/walked for Victoria‚Äôs Secret, you‚Äôve-probably-heard-of-her supermodel. Being the intelligent, enterprising woman she is, she wanted to test the waters for a new business idea. Her idea just happened to be in the same industry I work in, so she hired me to do some consulting work.

The three of us were on a phone call one night and she told us to Google her to find a particular campaign she had worked on. Her information popped up on the right column of search results and my boyfriend immediately stopped.

‚ÄúWait. I'm five years younger than you! Why does this say you were born three years after me??‚Äù She‚Äôs *almost a decade older* than her Wikipedia page states, and no one has a fucking clue.

She laughed and said it was super common for models and actors to have completely fake names and ages. I don‚Äôt mean fake names like ‚ÄúChanel Iman Robinson Shepard‚Äù decided to go by ‚ÄúChanel Iman.‚Äù I mean like an unbelievably good looking woman was born with a super unfortunate name and had it legally changed to something completely made up so she could be more marketable. Some of them even have completely fabricated backgrounds. That ‚Äúexotic‚Äù South African beauty? There‚Äôs a chance she might be from Ohio.

Celebrity tricks have totally destroyed men‚Äôs concept of what a woman in her thirties/forties looks like. ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù is not coming for you, ladies.

do5gtr,A thank you to the Red Pill man I dated,"I discovered the ""manosphere"" a few months ago and so many questions I had from my last relationship were explained. I must admit that I fell a bit too deep in the rabbit hole and begun obsessively reading all I could find on TRP and MGTOW and I couldn't find anything worthwhile from the female perspective (thought red pilled women was what I was looking for - it wasn't). So before I thank the one specific man who made me realize my worth, I'd like to thank all the MGTOW men obsessing over this subreddit and posting about it continuously which led me to discovering you incredible ladies. Thanks MGTOW!

I'm 22 now. Just over a year ago I was dating a man who had the luck of catching me at a very vulnerable time in my life. Someone close to me had passed away, I was lost career-wise and I had been in a car accident which resulted in me having to have 4 surgeries. I was feeling so low and this guy swooped me up. Looking back I cringe at thinking how easy it was for him - back handed compliments, dismissing my opinions, never paying for any dates, ""sex is a man's right in a relationship"". Emotional manipulation - I had lost function in my left hand from the accident and it prevented me from doing a lot of basic activities (it's like 95% back to normal now thankfully) so I would get a lot of ""do you know how lucky you are to have found a man willing to put up with this shit?"" Telling me how much I'd let myself go and 4 surgeries wasn't really an excuse for it.

My mum has two best friends who both have daughters around my age. We're all very close. They noticed how low my confidence and self esteem had dropped, how much I backed him up and made excuses for his behavior and they sat me down for an intervention. They told me that I had to realize my worth, that I was smart and funny and confident and independent and this man was stripping me of all of those characteristics. They pointed out the ways in which he was gas-lighting me and manipulating me and told me that the more of his shit that I accepted, the more I would receive.

So for the next couple of months I tried building myself back up. I rejoined my yoga classes, went back to school, joined some clubs at college, started investing money in the best hand-therapists I could find, as well as actual therapists too. The better I felt about myself, the worse he treated me. I wouldn't get praise for not letting myself go anymore, I got interrogations about whether I was getting fit, doing my make up, dressing up because I wanted to impress all the men in my college (I study math - very male dominated). When the 'dread game' as I now know it started, that's when I decided it was time to cut him off. We had gotten in an argument and he hadn't replied to my messages (I'd been basically pleading him to write back to me...ugh), however he was posting snapchat stories of him in clubs with a bunch of girls, then in a hotel room with his boys and other girls I'd never seen.

I was like - fuck this. I called my friends over and we'd been discussing a girls trip for ages but I was always pushing it off because he didn't agree with me going. We literally booked plane and accommodation tickets to Spain that night and we were off 3 days later. He had started replying to my messages by then, condescendingly ""I hope you've had some time to think about how crazy you've been acting"". I went along with it. First night in Spain, I just post to my snapchat story a picture with me and my girls with a bunch of hot shirtless Spanish dudes in a beach club and I location tag. Boom. Message after message after message from him. I don't reply to a single one the entire week we're there. My parents tell me that he'd been coming to the house to question them about me as well - my mum said she didn't know when I was coming back and my dad just told him to go away and slammed the door on his face.

I dumped him when I got back and he spent the next 6 months begging me to take him back, swearing he was going to change. I didn't falter and now it's been a year and I am tougher, happier and more confident than I ever was. So thank you Mr Red Pill. You really were a bitter pill to swallow, but you've made me into the incredible woman I am. I will never again doubt my worth.

And I am so excited to have found this sub (and a few radfem subs I didn't know existed!!) and can't wait to engage with this community more!

dmsi5h,5 Common ways men gaslight you,"**Questioning the way you look** \- Commenting negatively on your clothes, make up, weight, age, because they feel insecure or overly secure about their own looks

My last bf commented on how I look good without make up and added, ""at least to him"". I acted as if this wasn't insulting and smiled. The next day I told him how cute his dad bod is and how I only dated super buff guys before.

Don't take shit from men. Give it back to them with a smile on your face.

**Questioning your intelligence and emotional stability -** Also logical thinking, education and knowledge of certain issues, because they feel threatened by smarter and more educated women.

When a man implies you're not rational/intelligent enough, remind him of some stupid, irrational, emotional thing they did or said. When one of my exes implied women are the emotional gender, I reminded him of the time we nearly broke up and he started crying, thinking I will leave him.

**Questioning your abilities** \- For example, men frequently questiioning driving skills of women despite being much more deadly on roads. This is one of my favourite statistics. Ratio of men vs women involved in deadly road accidents is 9:1. Men are wreckless drivers who project their own lack of driving skills onto women.

**Questioning your sex life and relationships -** judging you for sexual past, because they doubt their own sexual prowess and penis size. It's best to keep them in mist regarding this. If you speak of your exes, never speak in things your bf would be interested to know (too graphic and too sexual topics such as partner count and penis sizes). You don't want to put those images in their head unless you really want to hurt them.  Men only ask them because they're silly sometimes and like hurting themselves, but lucky for them, you're smart and you know how to deal with this better:

Speak only about *behaviours* of your exes that you would or wouldn't like to see in your current bf - ""oh my ex really knew how to listen to me. I love men who are good listeners"" and ""my ex was a dear, but such a slob. His dishes were always dirty, I hated his apartment"". This will guide your bf in the right direction.

**Questioning your world/political views** \- This depends on the intention. If a man is really interested in let's say, your feminism, and wants to know why you're a feminist, tell him about it. If he's obviously being negative about it, give him a specific reason for why you're a feminist. My reason is ""because women didn't try to gang rape me when I was 13, men did"" which usually shuts them the hell up.

If he continues to push mgtow/right wing/anti female bullshit, I keep my smile on, block him on my phone and never see him again.

Left wing men aren't necessarily great either since they're defenders of porn and prostitution, but they're a better choice for dating and far more flexible. Studies show conservative men are, on average, less intelligent and more aggressive. Since I want only the best genetic material, I avoid right wing men and choose left wingers, but this really depends on your personal choices and every man can be a story for himself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dmsi5h/5_common_ways_men_gaslight_you/,1571979156.0,78,0.75,48,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

Take care of yourself, invest in your own health and happiness first and foremost, and value self improvement and growth for their own sake. Cultivate a deep sense of self-love.

In terms of romantic relationships, just keep in mind that your significant other isn't guaranteed to stick around--even if you exchange vows with them--so make sure that you retain a certain level of independence. It doesn't mean you can't form a deep bond with them, but if they leave you abruptly, you always want to be in a position where you can take care of yourself and move on within a reasonable timeframe. If you're financially and emotionally dependent upon your partner, then losing them will be devastating and you may even have to scramble to survive. Naturally, you never want to find yourself in such a situation, which is why we emphasize becoming a Queen on this sub.

dkoenf,ladies stay woke with these 'feminist' men on dates,"Just a reminder to stay safe when dating guys off dating apps particularly if they claim they're feminist mid way!!

I went on a date with a guy I met online yday...he kinda sprung it on me and I wasn't fully in the mood but I thought fuck it, I haven't met a guy from a dating app in ages so i'll give it a go.

Anyway, so first red flag, I ask him to come to the door of the bar, so I'm not wandering around aimlessly...he ain't tryna move and says 'I'm at the back' (yes I know I broke the no drinking on first dates rule, a mistake I will return to later LOL)

I eventually find him but I already know this isn't gonna go well.......(how hard is it just to walk over to the door? Entitlement?). First impressions count..and little things like this are usually subtle signs of what you're about to deal with

So I walk over and he's tall and I find him attractive at least and he has a deep ass voice. Off to good start. We get talking about London &amp; where hes from blah blah and then he says he's a 'progressive' I'm thinking ok here we go......

He starts telling me hes a feminist (I haven't mentioned my feminist views at all by this point &amp; there is nothing in our past convos that would indicate I am) and says his country is so sexist, and slutshaming women is so hypocritical because men are allowed to sleep around blah blah. He is really getting into the politics, seeming all passionate about womens rights.

I'm thinking ahhh well that's sweet BUT in the back of my mind I'm remembering radical feminists telling me *'never trust a man who says hes feminist'*

He starts showing me all his feminist facebook statuses or whatever as proof to me cos he can tell I'm suspicious, and telling me how he has this female bestfriend he respects so much she is amazing blah blah

By this point he's getting a bit touchy saying oh don't mind if I'm touchy *that's how we are in my culture* let me know if it offends you (seems sweet and respectful right? Remember the too good to be true flag??). We keep chatting but honestly this guy has no sense of humour AT ALL so I'm not really feeling getting super touchy with him, he is making me feel stiff by being such a stiff person. He isn't like being flirty/funny and making me relax enough to do that. It feels like I'm on a date with a creepy uni professor if you know what I mean and I am majorly into funny guys due to my sense of humour, it just makes me more attracted/ comfortable.

Anytime I make a joke he doesn't get it and gets defensive quick like 'no no no' (he does not read sarcasm). Just droning on about his 'feminism' and trying to get hands on thinking I'm so impressed (other couples were on dates near us and not doing all that anyways). Altho he is quite attractive (strong testosterone vibes), I'm just not feeling it at a sexual level, even when I eventually kissed him it felt off. The personality chemistry is just not there, and that's the main thing that makes me tick.

Anyway so after 2 drinks this motherfucker tries sending me to the bar (YEP THIS IS WHY U DON'T GO ON DRINKING DATES LADIES, IT IS TOO CHEAP FOR THEM!!)...I'm already like oh no he's one of those 'lets be equal' tit for tat dudes, even tho the game is still heavily rigged against women.

I say I'm not thirsty, and wait for him to get another round. I don't allow myself to get drunk, I'm still pretty with it despite not eating.

He's getting more touchy at this point saying I'm being so stiff and British (nah I'm just not into huge PDA's on first dates lol I don't even know you that well) and he mentions whether I will actually go to see him in London (he's moving there for a job soon) because *'women often say they will do things like that but don't'* (I smell depravity/resentment)

So anyway its getting late and he's tryna convince me to let him go mine because its 'cold'. At this point the 'feminist' mask starts sliding off and he's back to his entitled oppressor comfort zone trying to coerce me into letting him 'cuddle' at mine....saying he doesn't judge women for that stuff anyway &amp; its 'in his culture' to be close....yeah sure. Anyway I blow him off cos I gotta get up early in the morning and we part ways. He looks VISIBLY disgruntled.

The next day there's a giant essay from him saying he thought I was beautiful and intelligent but I was too cold for him blah blah and how he needs more touching / affection (than I felt comfy with on a FIRST date) because of his 'culture' and basically trying to guilt trip me for not fucking him the first night. He said he doesn't want to see me again because of it although I'm a 'nice girl'. I can tell he's tryna bait me into some emotional caretaker response to validate his desirability.

Immediately I'm getting butthurt stalker vibes from how quickly he's pinging me these messages, one after the other. I tell him I don't get how he can claim he's a feminist and then get mad because he didn't get what he wanted, if he was really respectful of women he wouldn't feel entitled. He then starts trying to backtrack like ohh no its not that blah blah I really like you hehe are going to see me in London blah blah you not want to see me again? I get another essay before I block him straight.

Then I get ANOTHER BUTTHURT essay on my dating app straight away (forgot to block him there) calling me a dickhead and sexist and saying its all cos I'm a feminist I'm judging him blah blah....WTF BRO. WE WENT ON ONE DATE!! I LITERALLY JUST MET U!

THIS IS WHY U DON'T TRUST MEN WHO SAY THEY ARE FEMINISTS. He was clearly using that as a manipulative ploy to make me think he wouldn't judge me if I slept with him straight away (regardless if I wanted to). Besides men can never be feminists (only allies) because they are NOT a woman. He was clearly depraved of sex and did not care about the signals I was giving him. He clearly didn't have the first clue about feminism, and just expected me to take him home and let him fuck even tho I wasn't feeling it (and on my period anyways). Why did he feel entitled to come my place as a stranger anyway? I was not exactly all over him and I was dressed in jeans and a classy blouse..plus I'd only just known him a matter of hours. Oh wait, because he is a depraved male...

So yeah, this has kinda put me off online dating again because there's so many depraved dudes that are literal butthurt psychos underneath their sweet talk on there. But besides going to a bar (which makes it easier 4guys to get cheapskate), I think my mistake with this one is I let him spring the date on me fast, we hadn't been talking TOO long and really I should of made an excuse to leave the minute he said he was feminist. Also I noticed he was barely asking any questions about me, he was mostly focused on convincing me of HIS views and his persona (trying to dominate).

But just a reminder, to never trust dudes that wax lyrical about feminist stuff because they're probably saying it to coerce you into sex faster whilst seeming like a 'good guy'. I am really glad I blew this guy off because I could tell he'd be controlling and obsessive, possibly a physical danger too, due to his temperament.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dkoenf/ladies_stay_woke_with_these_feminist_men_on_dates/,1571599528.0,68,0.8,21,FemaleDatingStrategy,modernmedusaa

djtj1e,Tinder moid lied about every single aspect of his identity. Trust your intuition ladies!!,"Before I deleted Tinder for good, for many many reasons, I matched with this guy who called himself Kara. He was super cute and loving, and really good looking, but something just seemed off in a strange, can't quite put my finger on it way.

There was a whole lot of red flags with this guy. I'll just state some of them.

1. He asked my why I broke up with my boyfriend and I said that it happened due to some core differences. He wouldn't let go and insisted on knowing what differences exactly, which I obviously didn't tell him since it's none of his business. Then, without me even asking, he proceeded to tell me how he broke up with his ex because she always complained about them having too little sex. He told me how sex is not everything and how he loves to just chill, watch movies, cuddle, yadda yadda.

Idk if he is actually a caveman still thinking that women don't enjoy sex or what, but I knew that he was full of shit. Obviously not all women enjoy sex to the same extent, but I am definitely more on the ""I could do this until I faint"" side, so it really didn't work with me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  I mentioned that I was stressed and studying, and he said ""I'll come and cuddle you"". I do love cuddling, however, I never showed any signs of being interested in cuddling *him.* I took it as a joke and said ""whatever lmaooo"", to which he sends me a picture of him sitting in his car with the caption ""I just need your address"". Idk why this creeped me out so much but I stopped responding to his messages completely.

He texted me three times after that, apologizing in case he had said anything wrong and asking me to simply respond, which I, being a nice fucking person, do. We start talking again and after two weeks of not showing any red flags, we agree to a date. He would pick me up from uni, take me to a nice restaurant, all that stuff, and it did resonate with my standards and expectations atm, so I was like why not.

And now my favorite one, red flag number 3.

The evening before we were supposed to meet up it started raining heavily. On my way home from uni he texts me someting in the terms of ""perfect weather for cuddling"", and I respond with ""yeah, if you're cozy at home and not freezing outside"". He hits me with the ""you should've called me, I would've picked you up, blah blah"", piss off honestly, if you wanted to pick me up you would've texted me before I was almost home. Not to mention the fact that I am not giving my address to a random guy from tinder. About an hour later I'm at home studying and he texts me ""man, now I gotta drive to (name of the area I live in). So I'm like ""really? why?"" and he deadass says ""coming to your place"". I take it as a joke cause he cannot be that fucking weird, to which he sends me his location with the question ""Come on, am I nearby?"".

Ghosted him immediately after that.

Fast forward to yesterday, turns out my sisters boyfriend acutally works with him. His name is first of all not Kara. The whole not having sex story was more made up then the posts on r/AITA, since he is the biggest fuckboy, a new chick every two days - type of guy. And now my favorite part, the mentioned ex girlfriend, whom he broke up with because she complained about not having enough sex, is not an ex at all. She is his current girlfriend who is absolutely clueless about everything, since she has been in a hospital for weeks now after suffering a terrible car crash.

I genuinely cannot wrap my head around someone being this much of a complete piece of shit. Still, as it so often happens with men, disappointed, but not surprised.

djqcix,Do women really need dating strategy advice? ü§î,"Hey ladies, y‚Äôall are doing absolutely amazing. 

Alright let‚Äôs get down to it. This sub has grown exponentially in the past few weeks/months and we are so happy that you all joined and we welcome your input/strategy advice, as long as it coincides with the general goal of the sub. 

We‚Äôre doing so well, the sub has been picked by multiple RP, MGTOW and incel groups [like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/dhpr50/femaledatingstrategy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Apart from the usual weak cope stemming from their bitterness and anger that they use to deceive themselves that our strategies won‚Äôt work, one of the things mentioned is that only unattractive women need dating advice and strategies. Let‚Äôs take a step back and think about this for a second. Think about your own dating experience. Whether you‚Äôre an attractive or an unattractive woman, old or young, experienced or not, what have you noticed about the kind of men you end up having to date when you don‚Äôt require much value from the men that come your way? 

Many men will certainly throw themselves at you, but what quality are these men? What efforts do they bring and what value do they offer? What ways can you make sure you get the most and the maximum use of the men that come your way and ensure that you‚Äôre always one step ahead with minimal negative effects or damage to you, your physical, mental and emotional health? 

Answers to these questions is what we and this sub offers you. You yourselves know that so many men have such little value and until you project yourself as someone requiring him to have value before you agree to be with him, you‚Äôll always end up with the shorter end of the stick. 

These RP, MGTOW and incel men will and continue to cry hot tears because they know that when women come together and realize their value and have ways to negate men‚Äôs manipulative tactics, they stand no chance. The inherent value you have as a female places you at a higher position, but imagine what you can become and what you can get when you‚Äôre actually aware of their tactics and you‚Äôre armed with strategies to counter them and get the most for yourself? ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Men know this and they‚Äôre scared. Appropriately so. Let‚Äôs keep it that way.

djaq2o,"If you want commitment, marriage, children, to be taken out, treated like you‚Äôre special, then you must insist upon it, and make it clear right away. Never play down your needs to seem chill.","Have you ever seen an advice column, or flipped open a women‚Äôs magazine, seen something like this?

‚ÄúDear Abby,

I don‚Äôt understand why I am still single.   I am a fun, cute girl who is always up for a good time.   I don‚Äôt need to be taken on fancy dates, I am fine just chilling with a guy at his place, I am totally sexually fun and open, I don‚Äôt have any desperate need for babies and I am not in a hurry to get to the altar.   I don‚Äôt make a lot of demands on men, I am totally low maintenance and I don‚Äôt get possessive.   I have a cool city fun job and I do yoga, I am totally modern, cool, chill and don‚Äôt ask much, so why am I still single?  Why can‚Äôt I get a man to commit? 

Sincerely,

Confused Cool Girl.‚Äù

Whenever I have seen such a letter, I want to grab this woman and say:  This.  You just listed the reasons.  That‚Äôs it that‚Äôs the explanation.

Everything you said is why you are single.


Confused Cool Girl is probably not aware she is cool girling or trying hard.   She probably genuinely thinks she‚Äôs super chill and not in a rush to get to the altar, but if that were true she wouldn‚Äôt be sad about not getting commitment.

Here‚Äôs a tip:  if you are acting like you‚Äôre in no rush for your needs to be met, why would a man rush them for you?

The most important takeaway from this post is that **men *say* they want a woman who appeals to their male imperative, but they do not *respect* a women who does that at the expense of her own needs; they marry women who are not afraid to honor their own imperative**

I am not saying a woman who genuinely feels all those things and isn‚Äôt sure she wants marriage won‚Äôt be respected.   But in spite of what men say over and over, if you genuinely want marriage with a quality man,  playing it down to seem cool and because low value men have screeched about how marriage is something to run away from is just shooting yourself in the foot.

Some men do want a woman who appeals fully to his desire to get laid and stay single, and you can do that too, if you want to be a plate.

If you want marriage and family, or even if your goal is just a FWB where you get treated like a queen, **he should know this by the first date or at most after say, three meetings.**

No you shouldn‚Äôt make it personal early on like you must marry him specifically, but he should know it is your goal.

The high value men who choose marriage respect that you respect yourself, they will not if you pretend.   No matter how often men say they love a passive 100% submissive docile obedient maid and sex doll who does not need commitment.   That is not who they marry.

You are not a bitch or a ‚Äústupid female‚Äù if you want commitment, marriage, children, a nice dinner, jewelry, affection.

Insist upon your standards immediately.   If this drives a man away, congratulations, you just saved yourself months or even years of your valuable time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/djaq2o/if_you_want_commitment_marriage_children_to_be/,1571337946.0,121,0.95,9,FemaleDatingStrategy,GemstoneLucia

didcuy,The Art of the Tease: Mastering Sexual Tension,"I see a lot of posts talking about sex on this sub, particularly centering on figuring out when you should allow any given relationship to turn sexual, and it seems that having intercourse is the major tipping point. I don't think this is the right approach or mindset for dealing with men, and intercourse should be delayed as long as possible, perhaps even until securing an engagement or longer. That might sound crazy to you now, but it won't when you finish reading this.

Before we get into the main topic, let's talk about modern male sexuality. Men are accustom to an overabundance of sexual stimulation (typically in the form of pornography) and more options for casual sex than ever before in human history. When you factor those in together with the nature of male orgasm, men tend toward expecting and desiring instant gratification. They want to do the bare minimum required to receive sexual gratification as soon as possible. This leaves women in the unfortunate position of being the gatekeepers of sexual activity in a relationship. Because men are sexual opportunists and will rarely turn down sex when offered, it's up to you to set the pace of sexual escalation and determine what happens. I'll get more into this later, but managing this position and using it to secure maximum benefits requires massive self-discipline--however, once you embrace the position and step into your power as gatekeeper, you probably won't want to go back to ""normal"" sexual courting ever again.

The Art of the Tease isn't just about gatekeeping, it's about prioritizing sensual and erotic pleasure over the purely sexual. Sensual pleasure is simply pleasure via your five senses: touch, scent, sight, taste, and touch. The erotic originates from your brain and pertains to your thoughts, your feelings, and your imagination. It's my belief that the brain is the most sexual organ in the human body! Most men are slaves to their hormonal impulses and their genitals when it comes to sex. You want that to shift to their brain and the totality of their body, rather than just what's dangling between their legs. 

A woman who has mastered the Art of the Tease knows how to create and leverage sexual tension so that even the most basic romantic and sexual interactions are imbued with intense pleasure, passion, excitement, and meaning.

So, how might a women accomplish that? Here are some basic principles, tips, and tricks. All of these interrelate with each other so so don't them as a straightforward list of steps; all of these need to be considered and developed to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Escalate physical, romantic, and sexual affection very slowly.
   * As slowly as possible. And take intercourse off the table for a very long time. Sexual tension can't develop if you're getting hot and heavy early on. If you want your first kiss to be electric, wait awhile. Tease and flirt with the possibility but pull away with a girlish laugh and a wicked smile at the last second. Get as close as possible to the line without crossing it until you've made him work for the privilege of kissing you. Men aren't used to being denied or managed in this way, and it will drive him crazy, because other girls give in to sex too early and too often. You want a man to anticipate a kiss or a touch, you want him to start fantasizing about you as soon as you leave. Keep the mystery alive!
* Filter ruthlessly
   * The truth is, not every guy is going to have the patience to be teased, even if it's fun. They're too pornsick, or they're massively selfish, or they're entitled jerks. If you try to tease a guy and he responds with anger, dump him immediately. If he crosses your boundaries, never see him again. Moreover, if he tries to pornographize any aspect of the relationship, stop everything you're doing and walk away. For example, if you're talking to each other in a sexy way, and he says something porny like ""You're my little slut, aren't you?"" you shut it down and leave him immediately. You physically and emotionally disengage at once and say, ""I'm no one's slut"", and ask him to leave (or you leave), then block him. Porn-influenced speech and behavior is a huge red flag. More on that later. But what's nice about this approach is that you have plenty of time to vet a guy and get the measure his character before involving yourself physically.
* Explore a wide range of pleasures together
   * Learn to give and receive pleasure that isn't explicitly sexual. What feels better than sex, or just as good as sex, or close to sex? Do those things together!
* You must be in control 100% of the time, and you have to be the first to end a kiss (or other things)
   * This can be very difficult, because if you're doing everything right and the man you're with is game, it's likely you'll be caught up in a whirlwind of feelings, too. If you give a man an inch, he'll take a mile. When you're making out with a guy and there's passion it's very hard to pull back and tell him you have to go, but the bottom line is, you want to leave a man always craving more. But you want a man to crave you, and letting things go on too long, or letting things happen too often, kills cravings. Always pull back, always make a lighthearted excuse about needing to stop, and always flash your prettiest, most charming smile. Regular meditation and mindfulness practice can go a long way to building self-discipline in general.
* Only engage in romantic and sexual behavior in person
   * In general, a relationship should be deepened in person, not through text, video, or phone calls, with the exception of general pre-screening correspondence before meeting in person for the first time. When it comes to sex and romance, NEVER flirt through texts, NEVER send nudes and videos or accept them from men, NEVER give men sexual material that they can use on their own time. They need to learn that relationships can only grown face-to-face, and that for anything romantic or sexual to happen, they need to spend time with you in person. Keep texts, calls, and other social media correspondence business-like, and use it exclusively for arranging dates.
* Keep it wholesome
   * With the prevalence of pornography use and participation in bdsm, even among women, this might be hard for some of you to wrap your minds around. Porn, bdsm, kinks, and fetishes are all indicators of what I call shame-based sexuality. I won't go into depth about that here (that's for an upcoming post), but you want to avoid shame-based sexuality and behavior, especially if it's being requested by a man. Men who get off to sexualized violence and/or humiliation, even if it's ""asked for"", are to be avoided at all costs. Why would you waste time with a man who can orgasm while hurting a woman? That's a sign of deep-seated misogyny.  Furthermore, men don't actually respect women who participate in shame-based sexual behaviors; they'll always be ""dirty"" in the eyes of men, and all men resent ""dirty"" women, even if these men engage in the exact same behaviors! So, keep it wholesome. So-called vanilla sex gets a bad rap these days but it can be thrilling, wonderful, and exciting.
* One step forward, two steps back
   * When you decide to escalate, never perform the same act the very next time you see them. Maybe pull back the reins and go back to just kissing. Make it clear you're the one in charge and that you call the shots. 
* Learn to say a million things with just one glance, or gesture, or smile, or sound
   * When you get really good at body language, you can heighten sexual tension with just one look. It's thrilling when you can drive a man wild with a gasp only he can hear. If you need to, start practicing in the mirror, and ask some close girlfriends to act as judges and coaches.
* Teach him that making YOU happy will end in good things for him... but only intermittently
   * Don't escalate sexual and romantic behavior ""just because"", wait until he does something particularly nice or generous for you. But don't reward him every time he's exceptionally generous. In psychology, it's been shown that giving intermittent rewards for a desired behavior yields better results than guaranteed rewards. 
* Start building a high-quality lingerie collection
   * Better yet, have *him* build your lingerie collection. Think of it as high-quality gift wrapping for a high-quality woman. When you're courting a man and choosing to take the relationship to the next level, wearing plain ore merely pretty underwear just isn't going to cut it. On your own time, wear whatever you want, but on dates, wear something luxurious.
* Make sure your pleasure comes first, and never fake an orgasm
   * Never give pleasure without first being pleasured. And be 100% truthful about your experience of pleasure; if he's not doing it for you, let him know. You're not here to coddle his ego. Since you've taken it slow, he'll be emotionally invested in you well before you've actually gotten to giving and receiving orgasms, so he'll genuinely want to please you. Be selfish and demand pleasure without reciprocating. For example, if you've gotten to the point where you're giving and receiving oral sex, let him bring you to orgasm and then say you have to leave. Flash a winning smile, give him a kiss on the cheek, and get dressed and out the door. Male orgasms are cheap, so never give him one without getting yours first, but feel free to take without giving.

When you get really good at this, experiencing the tension and build-up is much more fun than the actual sex acts. Most men never experience prolonged sexual tension and it drives them crazy (in a good way if they're decent men), and they'll be hounding you for a date. You want them to think about you constantly, to crave your presence, to wonder what might happen when you see each other next. All of this creates wonderful, dizzying passion. It also tends to engage men's feelings in a deeper way. To them, you become unique and wondrous, or as they say in The Rules, ""a creature unlike any other.""

I've done this with all of my exes and all of them speak glowingly of our time together, all of them consider me the one that got away, the love of their lives. A couple of their wives hate me with a passion, though I've never been inconsiderate or unkind to them. A lot of that feeling is due to maintaining sexual tension over the course of our relationship. It's so much fun. If you've been longing for a passionate relationship, this is a way to get it, assuming you find the right kind of man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/didcuy/the_art_of_the_tease_mastering_sexual_tension/,1571169173.0,84,0.83,17,FemaleDatingStrategy,AQueenCrowned

dfztcl,Don't internalise the insecurities fuckboys project or see singledom as a personal failure,"This has been one of my **most valuable lessons** as a woman &amp; is why I am still standing strong (no dusty baby daddy, no bullshit approach to dating, men's actions don't control my esteem).

It dawned on me after several instances of seeing these clowns masks fall off over the years.......(they all look like the same witless intellectually sterile Himbo clones in the end)..... these 'men' so desperate to clown me for bRo pOinTs were not deserving of the opportunity at all. I've never cared much for these clowns, because I don't struggle attracting men (so their absence is hardly *whimsical*) but what deeply amused me about this repetitive archetype of weak try-hard flimsy 'masculinity' was just how much they seemed to get some sadistic kick out of trying to strum me along....as if dick isn't abundant and these mentally feeble clowns aren't easily replaceable?? SIS. Where is the joke? I'm still waiting for my refund. I think it lies within the mucky toothpaste splattered reflections of their narcissistic fragile ego's. *'SURPRISE! I am MORE TRASH THAN YOU THINK!! hAhA ME PROUD!!'*. 

Like it was some achievement to fool someone genuine that has more options /more going than you and has barely known you a matter of months? Like I'm supposed to be some mystic meg clairvoyant or a fly on the wall at all times...and if not that makes me at fault ? How can one possibly KNOW someone without *GETTING to KNOW* their disappointing characters and habits over a period of time first? They could never keep the act up long..... but still a fool is still proud of his tomfoolery, nevertheless. He's still proud of his little fake Louis Vuitton's in the schoolyard, at least it gives him something to boast about. Of course a man-child *must* muster his false sense of man-pride from somewhere...some thing....or someone.

It dawned on me after some time in my teens- these men were just an internal idealisation that I had cooked up  in my head and perhaps been hesitant to abandon due to the severe boredom and lack of HVM in the wild- due to the constant disappointments of failing to meet just...one.... single GROWN man that matched even half of what they had to titty-suck from me. I am sure you can appreciate, one begins to hallucinate and see water ( a real life HVM!!) in a hot dry desert (the eternal lifeless echo of the dating landscape) where there isn't any after a while. Intellectually, emotionally starved manchildren are much like the harsh dry inhospitable heat of the sand- one begins to grow weary after tireless years spent squinting and searching and having their ankles bitten by hostile reptiles....and starts to project their own grand DELUSIONS of basic necessities being met onto these simple... insignificant.... common grains of sand that are incapable of fulfilling such a demand. WAKEY WAKEY!

You can't get blood from a stone, trust me. That was just the illusion they created to feed their false ego and attract women they knew were WAY out of their intellectual, physical, spiritual, mental grasp. When I reflected back on them as a full package and not their fake highlight reel (which \*EMPHASIS\* was the only real catch-indeed an artificial one), weighing up all their supposed 'offerings' to me as a woman, I trumped them in every field, every time, by far....and they knew full well deep down. Their natural inferiority, *that is.* It dawned on me that these 'men' were incredibly weak, cowardly and insecure inside. That they went out of their WAY to avoid being in a vulnerable position ripe for intimacy. They went out of their way to try and bring these other women they were texting to my attention- they so badly WANTED me to see these text notifications from other women to garner some kind of jealous kneejerk response or attention, like an immature child deliberately throwing its dummy out of the pram, trying to catch dear mommy's attention. 

That they went out of their WAY to try and neg me or *attempt* to make me insecure or pit me against some other females as if I wouldn't notice their blatant attempts to lower my self value to their level and find them *utterly* pathetic. They were scared of womens power. Scared of womens judgement. Scared of intimacy. Scared of rejection. Scared of manhood and adult responsibility. Scared of not feeling wanted back. Scared of being vulnerable. Scared of women wising up to the fact that they weren't real MEN nor were they confident or worthy enough to actually ever allow themselves to seem vulnerable to these women (implying they are truly weak)....and they were desperately trying to hide it by chasing constant validation from any female they could fool in sight. THAT didn't strike me as a man who held self value, strength, maturity and confidence close to his heart....that struck me as a desperate immature little coward-boy running around trying to get anyone to give his fragile little ego a boost. Who has the time, seriously? Truly high value people don't fear rejection, they certainly don't have anything to 'prove'.

And from that day forth, shitty men ceased to have any power over me. I finally saw the tiny insecure little manlet plankton that lived deep within the clown. The rose tinted lenses fell off and their delusions of grandeur ceased to impress. 

Often us women foolishly tend to feel we're not 'good enough' when a man (usually lucky to get the chance to begin with) starts acting trash or disrespecting us or us showing less interest...even when we've been nothing but kind, honest and accommodating and haven't been demanding or clingy. Even if we're attractive, get a lot of attention, have worked on ourselves, are driven etc. We did everything by the book &amp; still get played. We start thinking we need to lower our standards to accommodate their failings or this man doesn't see any value in us at all. You start to think you will never find a good guy that sees value in loyalty....

WELL HONEY, HERE'S THE REAL TEA- THIS IS *RARELY* TRUE FOR A HIGH VALUE WOMAN!

THIS is ONE man *out of billions* and how he has decided to treat you, *for whatever reason*, this does not mean EVERY man will treat you like this or that you are not valuable or worthy of love/commitment. Its just one trial, and its expired. He just belongs to the fuckboy breed- the one you REALLY don't want to be involved with anyway (see redpillwomen for the bullets you sure damn missed).

The fact is women are far more likely to settle than men are, and this has been backed up by studies and divorce rates (women are more likely to initiate divorce). We are far more likely to date down in looks /education and overlook red flags / undesirable traits than they are...*'well I'll give him a chance, he could be a good guy or going through stuff'.* And men are certainly less likely to settle when it comes to attraction, even if they are below average looks wise themselves.

You can be attractive, smart, well dressed, driven, healthy, well read, interesting, well travelled, caring, kind, funny, honest and trash men will STILL treat you like gum on their shoe or just a piece of meat. They'll still have this *'impress me'* air to them even when they don't match up a 1/4 what you have going on. These men you settle for will still lie to you and think they're the shit.

Ofc sometimes this is a sign we need to check our self esteem/possible codependency issues (particularly if you're pursuing these men for 8months longggg after you saw the red flags)...but this isn't always the case. Sometimes you're just a high value woman running into one of the many many average or below men who think of themselves as god gifts to women.

This can often be because of several reasons besides you: THEY are insecure and don't feel like they have enough to stop you from straying *(they can tell you have enough options &amp; are going further in life than them which makes them feel inferior)*, THEY are immature and have not spiritually developed yet *(girls are for fucking, nothing more, name irrelevant),* THEY are running away from personal issues by fucking several women to boost their esteem (*I'm the man I pull chicks! Sob, why I can't I earn more!),* THEY haven't got their shit together and feel its not a good time to get into a relationship *(mental health issues/addictions/financial instability)*, THEY don't think they're good enough *(salty cos they got dumped by their ex or cheated on)* or THEY have not worked on their resilience/communication and struggle to open up emotionally *(which is essential to a healthy longterm relationship).*

All of the shit above is out of your control, **do not internalise it.**

More women seem to settle below the belt than men but this is changing slowly (WOOH!! We are holding off marriage/babies more &amp; refusing to settle) and its in these dastardly depraved men's interests to knock your esteem down, so they feel comfortable and don't need to step up. So you don't feel like a threat, so they don't have to address the parts of themselves they feel anxious about, so they can keep you from moving on and discovering your equal (they don't wanna chance they might not get better). So the threshold isn't raised off the fucking ground for women, mothers and children.

They have a variety of ways they prevent this:  going hot/cold deliberately in order to make you yearn them, hiding themselves, lying about where they live/their career/goals, putting you down, testing your patience to see if you'll get emotional and validate them (they're insecure), acting with an overflated ego, trying to control you, putting you off travelling , belittling/rolling their eyes at you knowing more than them, making you paranoid they receive more interest than they do (fyi: men are ALWAYS receiving less interest than women unless they're top tier).

I will not let their lying sleezy insecure low vibrational shit get to me, I am a warrior and have overcome some very testing situations making me spiritually strong &amp; grown, I have an appetite for the high life and I stay hungry.  I stay ignoring fuckboys petty comments when they feel insignificant around me. I am well travelled, know myself deeply, know what I want deeply and I know there is more to life than where I started at or what fuckboys/beta males want to chain me to (a mediocre life full of burden &amp; resentment). I am in no danger of 'hitting the wall' since the women in my family are attractive, educated, and stay youthful for their age. I let insignificant men know full well I am aware of that &amp; the options it opens up to me. The wall is something most low value people fear most, the lazy ones who fell off their careers &amp; didn't take care of themselves &amp; have low esteem/standards...hence why they rush to wed the ex drug addict beta loser before 30, and spend their whole lives miserable.

Meanwhile I'm flying round the city, getting my drinks bought, turning heads &amp; sifting out the trash ruthlessly. The pick me's tell me *I'm too picky*, but they seem incredibly mad that as a woman I like myself and have the esteem to be patient. I've seen the real life outcome of high value women refusing to settle, and its better than you could dream of.  There is a girl I know, who married a rich well dressed business man who's attractive, started a huge business with her, treats her like a queen and they're constantly going on nice holidays living the high life. They are perfectly happy and constantly in eachothers photo's. Imagine how different her life would have been if she'd have let *one* fuckboy knock her esteem enough into settling for some cheating beta loser? THIS GAME IS NO JOKE. Its one of the most important choices of your life as a woman, and you should never take it lightly.

You need to laugh at dudes, where you overlooked undesirable factors, only for them to get too comfy and still treat you like shit. For example, he's lost his job, but you tried to be understanding &amp; not judge.......and he's STILL got an ego/messing around (a classic example, he's insecure he's become low market, so he's tryna make up for it via fuckboy shit). They are delusional- but that's what ego does to people. Release them back into the wild where they belong. Besides as a woman, you always know you're going to attract men over with little effort (all potential interests)...and you knew you were settling by overlooking \*insert red flags\* anyway, *you know* you can get/deserve better so there is no loss, only that stupid love bonding hormone called Oxytocin that is making you miss cuddling him. The world is BIG. Men like that only have a number of limited chances b4 they end up coming to a halt and realising they aren't all that. YEAH they might be able to *bullshit* different women for a few months at a time,  but can they keep a high value woman's interest? Nope. Once they start ageing and want something long term- they hit a wall &amp; will settle for whats available to them. She'll probably divorce him at some point (EVEN the handmaidens have breaking points)..&amp; he'll end up on reddit whining about it acting clueless.

SO ALL I'LL SAY IS

If you're dating a dude that only has one or two in demand factors such as he is attractive/tall....but he's bummy, not smart, egotistical, not particularly interesting and is on a petty wage but you *kinda maybe* think he's a nice person (or has potential) because he's *sometimes* sweet but *then* he went cold and is getting disrespectful..... you are settling and HE knows it. He needs to knock you down to his comfort zone. When you are questioning this mans intentions too much, time to move on.

DON'T INTERNALISE their projections! And DON'T SETTLE. Know what you have to offer, keep on improving yourself and stop letting low market men think you are not good enough! There is a guy out there waiting to find someone like you, or is on his way to becoming the high value man you will find in a year or 5 from now! Stop rushing and stressing! These men exist, they are rare, but you sure damn won't find them caught up on assholes, trying to *'find potential*' in fuckboys/beta males and convincing yourself that disrespectful men are worth self sacrificing for. I speak from experience.

This is the no 1 trick of low brow men.....and it has fooled so many women I've seen who are high value and have settled in 2 or 3 or 4 (!!) departments only to be treated like shit and are staying for the children. Don't be fooled!!!

Singledom is not a personal failure, when you're the one knocking these idiots back and refusing to settle..cos the options will stay open to you. Singledom is only a *failure,* when you're a handmaiden refusing to learn your lessons and chasing men who spell it out to you they don't want to pursue you..when you're codependent and can't see value in your own solitude. Being picky is smart, that's how you avoid dusty baby daddies and divorce. That's how you avoid domestic violence &amp;abuse or getting side tracked from you career for a cheat that drained you. That's how you become the type of  resilient woman that dusts off her shoulder, keeps her eyes on the prize and *gets what she deserves.* You're going to have to get tough, decisive and have firm boundaries...and you're going to have to put your head above your heart often.

Most of these men fooling you around know deep down *they are not up to scratch.*

ddpw4e,This sub continuously reminds me to take no man‚Äôs shit.,"I think I‚Äôm a bit younger than the average age on this sub, but you might as well stop taking men‚Äôs shit early on, right?

A few nights ago, a guy I‚Äôve been talking to said I should come over to his apartment. I was completely fine with that and thought it‚Äôd be fun regardless of what direction the night went in. I wasn‚Äôt super sure what he had in mind, since our interactions up until that point had been somewhere between friendly and flirty. Would‚Äôve been down to just hang out, would‚Äôve been down for more.  I said sure, just had to pick up a few drunk friends from a party and make sure they got home safe before heading over. 

Told him I was heading over, all seemed fine. He lives pretty close to a lot of bars/the football stadium, and a game was getting out so driving and finding parking was an absolute nightmare, especially with all the drunk people who would just kinda step into the street.

I let him know I was there. No response. I waited. And waited. Embarrassingly enough, I ended up waiting like 30 minutes, sitting in my car while it was raining. I should‚Äôve just left after like 5. I was super hurt and confused, especially since he was the one to invite me over (and this wasn‚Äôt the first time, I just hadn‚Äôt been available other nights). 

I drove to a friend‚Äôs place that was nearby since I was feeling like absolute shit and crashed there. He responded to me a few hours later (at around 2 am) saying he passed out and that he was really sorry. I was skeptical, but my friend convinced me he meant it. Well, sort of. I was still pretty wary of the whole thing, but didn‚Äôt cut him off. 

Until a day or so later. I tried to start a conversation with him, and I was getting the DRYEST responses ever. I tried one more time. Same thing. 

Honestly? I probably did too much. I should‚Äôve just left after 5 minutes that night and never talked to him again. I shouldn‚Äôt have even tried to start a conversation with him. I shouldn‚Äôt have worried about him feeling bad for HIS own actions. I had nothing to do with him ‚Äúpassing out‚Äù/ignoring me. But after my two small attempts at talking, I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it, in part because of this sub. 

I‚Äôve already done more than I should have, but at least I wasn‚Äôt in that deep. If he was sorry, I‚Äôd like to think he wouldn‚Äôt have just stopped talking to me... I still don‚Äôt really know what happened that night, if he was just trying to fuck with me and play some type of game. This is embarrassing, but there‚Äôs a chance I would still be trying with someone who doesn‚Äôt give a shit if it wasn‚Äôt for the constant empowerment on this sub. I‚Äôm definitely worthy of not being ignored and receiving basic attention, and hey!

dbybj8,Implementing these strategies has changed my dating life. [Long Post],"Before getting into the dating world again, I was in a LTR with a terrible person. Classic cheater who also sexually and emotionally abused me from time to time (though I didn't realize it was abuse while I was with him). After finally leaving him, I started dating again. I took about eight months to try to repair myself, but I ultimately still had low self-esteem and self-worth after all I had been through with my ex.

This reflected in my dating life. The last guy I dated was a prime example of what you don't do. I chased, I texted first, and I put him on a pedestal. I was his therapist and dotted on him. I treated him to outings. I did anything he wanted. I was down to hang out whenever he wanted, even it was a last minute date. I thought about him all the time. I was eager and tried very hard to please _him_ without expecting him to please me.

What ended up happening? 

Despite being the nice, considerate girl, I was slow faded after we had sex a couple times. That sucked and I was convinced it was me. I was convinced I was ugly. I wasn't attractive enough. There had to be something wrong with me physically, right? Why else would a man you treated well and did everything for walk out of your life? Sure, I had men at work hitting me up all the time. Yeah, a man on the street corner chased me down just to tell me I was beautiful. But if I was actually attractive, it didn't add up. 

That's when I found this sub. 

Instantly, I totally overhauled everything. Everything I'd been taught. Everything I thought was ""right"" was now turned on its head. I immediately got busy. I started up with my old hobbies I had relinquished after getting serious with my ex. I started salsa dancing again. I rekindled my love for French. I connected with friends I was isolated from in my relationship. I lived my life for me. 

What ended up happening? 

The same thing that always did. 

Men asked me out. 

Only this time, I changed the way I approached the men who asked me out. 

I wasn't always available. I didn't stop time and space to go out with them. If I had plans already? I stuck to them. If they asked me out at the last minute? I turned them down. If they wanted to see me then they needed to show me they planned our date in advance. My time is valuable. I would not be available _whenever_ for their convenience. 

Also, I didn't put them on a pedestal. These were _just_ men. They had proven nothing to me. Had they proven their value? Had they demonstrated their commitment to me? No, and I could easily live with or without them. I had my own life to live. My world no longer revolved around the men in my life. I was no longer interested in chasing because I could take them or leave them. 

Last, and most importantly, I valued myself. As I got out into the world more and did the things that once made happy again, I realized how valuable I was. I was smart, I was interesting, I was healthy, and I was kind. Before, with the last man I dated, I did not feel that was enough. I felt that despite all I had accomplished in my life, I was still lacking something. And what did I do? I compensated by chasing him and doting on him. Hoping that he would overlook the false deficiency I made up in my head. 

Now, I knew my worth. I knew how much of catch I was. Instead feeling lucky to have a man who had proven nothing to me, I now felt that a man would be lucky to have _me_. This subtle switch in my frame of mind made all the difference. I had upped my standards. I knew all I brought to the table. What did he bring? And more importantly, how was he going to show it?

So thanks to everyone for this sub! Thanks for the advice and the amazing book recommendations. In just a couple months, so much has changed. I went from depressed and doubting my appearance/worth, to having two high-value men chasing after me. I hope I can continue to pass this knowledge down to other women!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/dbybj8/implementing_these_strategies_has_changed_my/,1569957743.0,249,0.95,21,FemaleDatingStrategy,throwawayy92838383

dblfg2,Mythology Break Down #1: Men Telling You You'll Max Out At Thirty is Their BIGGEST Cope,"The reality?

We, as women, practice self-care in our appearance. We take meticulous care of our skin, hair, and bodies. We are careful about what we eat and we exercise regularly. Most of us have had skincare routines since we were in middle school. We have always managed to make time to take care of our appearance, even between our education, careers, and hobbies. That being said, at thirty and beyond all that hard work pays off big time for us.

[Women practice self-care at a young age.](https://preview.redd.it/jcr8o1j4wtp31.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8748c2523157a56554f02a5b6a09e5d00aad9d76)

**Males on the other hand?**

The average thirty-year-old male already has a receding hair line. His face has begun to bloat from the excessive alcohol usage and poor diet. A flat tire is already beginning to form around his mid-section. He has pre-mature wrinkles, sun damage, and uneven skin tone because he washes with Axe-3-In-1 Hair, Face, and Body Wash everyday and as never picked up a proper skincare product in his entire life. Throw in the erectile dysfunction from excessive pornography consumption throughout his youth?

Voil√†, there you have it folks.

**The Male Wall.**

[Women are far more meticulous about caring for their bodies.](https://preview.redd.it/o6fc1mc7wtp31.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f5af279edade6640670a04b255727b4ba9ba41e)

Not only do men hit the wall, but they hit the wall *hard* and *fast* because they have done the absolute bare minimum to take care of themselves their entire lives. The female ""hitting-the-wall-at-thirty"" propaganda, on the other hand, is an absolute myth. It's a lie they propagate to comfort themselves about being turned down by that twenty-something-year-old woman that is way too good for him. ""*Someday she'll be thirty and no one will want her*,"" he says to comfort himself.

We all know that's complete bullshit.

Men will pursue a woman at any age. We need only to look to the older women in our lives to confirm this.

**The reason men who brigade this sub like regurgitate that false folklore is simple.**

1. They are low-value males.
2. They feel threatened.
3. They are offended and angry that you have standards. (Especially standards they cannot meet.)

Males that propagate this myth want to grind you down. They want to make you afraid. If you fear ""maxing out"" at thirty you're less likely to have high standards and present yourself as high-value woman. You'll be more anxious and insecure, and thus more likely to settle down (literally, settle) for a male that has nothing to offer. Why? Because you fear approaching this *mythical* wall. Take a closer look at the context in which these men bring up this argument.

*Example From a Previous Thread:*

* Woman discusses wanting men to pay for dinner.
* Male gets offended and threatened.
* Male tell her not to expect such treatment when she turns thirty.

Now let's *dissect* this interaction:

* Women sets out an expectation/standard for men in her life.
* Man reacts negatively because he is a low-value man who is threatened by a standard he cannot meet (monetary).
* He attempts to make her insecure to lower her standards.

[Low-value men \(aka losers\) become angry when you have high expectations.](https://preview.redd.it/3n2t3gs9wtp31.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0b78613a7171432a3fb29660a630ed98ff59d3)

**Keep in mind that the men who propagate this myth are low-value.**

The type of men who brigade here (MGTOW, MensRights, Braincels) are low-value males. They have little to offer women and thus prey on women with low self-worth. They pursue women who have low standards and little self-respect. By implying that you will become worthless ""post-wall"", they are attempting to make you feel low-value. (If you feel low value, you're less likely to hold men to high standards.) These men are both lazy and entitled. They feel they should be able to sack a woman without in any real effort or investment. *They don't want to have to prove they are worthy, likely because they are not.*

**Never abandon your standards, regardless of your age.**

Now that we've broken down this myth, remember never to abandon your standards. By internalizing this propaganda you will only put yourself at a disadvantage. The moment you stop loving and respecting yourself (by seeing yourself as approaching or past the *mythical* wall), you become insecure, needy, and seek male validation. You don't want that! You must always remember your worth. The wall does not exist. You are a high value woman who has a career, education, friends, hobbies, and you take care of your body. Your value is not tied to a number. You are allowed to have standards *always*.

Real men respect and want women with standards, boundaries, and self-respect.

d9t6c0,Know What Your Standards Are and Stick to Them: Don't Settle for Less," 

https://preview.redd.it/x78a6bzpc1p31.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39cfdde41d190c267380609b3c6a19453928f5ac

One way to make your dating experience more seamless is to determine what your standards are and to stick to them. How do you want to be treated by your future boyfriend? What non-negotiable qualities should he have and what are your dealbreakers? 

* What kind of first dates do you want? Do you prefer a drink date or do you want a man to take you out to a nice restaurant? What caliber of restaurant do you want them to take you to?
* Do you want them to provide for you, to pay for dinners, movie tickets, Uber rides, etc.? What kind of restaurants do you want to be taken to? 
* How long would you keep seeing a man who hasn‚Äôt asked you for exclusivity yet? (Mine is 2 months at most. After that, they‚Äôre cut off.) 
* Are you okay with a man who only wants to see you once a week or do you require a man wanting to see you more than that for you to know that he‚Äôs serious? 
* How long would you wait for him to introduce you to his friends? 
* When are you going to have sex with him? 

https://preview.redd.it/dg65nkcyc1p31.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f72039866422a717e1c185f83ea1ce2026553e02

Really think about the kind of dating experience that you want. Your answer shouldn‚Äôt be colored by your previous bad experiences or what they world tells you to want. Just think about how you want your future boyfriend to treat you in an ideal world. 

https://preview.redd.it/uaj6hh53d1p31.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1ddca63de7f848952a564809df744f95e377999

**What if I told you that how you want to be treated is very much possible?** I know the world always tells us to lower our standards and to be realistic. People try to invalidate your real needs and they tell you to settle for someone who can‚Äôt give you what you want. It‚Äôs how they try to excuse men‚Äôs subpar behavior. Instead of a man changing his behavior, apparently we should be the ones who should accept less than exemplary behavior and reward them with our youth and feminine presence.

**Say no to that.** 

As an empowered woman, you have to OWN up to your desires and to never accept something that doesn‚Äôt align with what you truly desire. Love yourself enough to honor your desires. When you accept nothing less than what you want, it allows you to cut through the bullshit. You don‚Äôt have to think, *‚ÄúOh, is him doing X acceptable? Should I be okay with it? What should I do to make him change his mind?‚Äù* 

When you honor your standards, you instead communicate to a man frankly what kind of behavior or quality you expect from a man. Examples from my personal life:

If a man wants to take me to a restaurant that I don‚Äôt find date-appropriate, I tell him frankly that I‚Äôm accustomed to nicer places. He can either find a restaurant that would please me or he can find another date.

Another example: I meet a man in a group setting, we go out and are affectionate with each other. But when we meet again in a group setting, he doesn‚Äôt act like how he‚Äôd act when we‚Äôre on a date. I ignore him at the end of the night, and when he asks me what‚Äôs wrong, I tell him that I prefer guys who treat me in public like how they treat me privately when we go out on dates. I don‚Äôt say it in a needy way. I just tell him what my expectations are and it‚Äôs up to him to step up and change if he wants to keep me. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rovdjltbd1p31.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38b4c6fe84b8cb11f71aa61e94ad7d8a5d77019b

Recently, I‚Äôve learned how valuable honesty is. The more honest you are about your real desires and your standards, the more men will respect you and treat you like girlfriend material. I‚Äôve done the two examples I‚Äôve provided recently with a man and the man in question DID find a nicer restaurant and he DID change his behavior and was so regretful that he treated me that way. He said that he didn‚Äôt mean to do that and was just respectful of my space, and that it was the last time he‚Äôll mess up like that again. I‚Äôve made it clear to him how I expect to be treated and he changed his behavior because he wants to keep me. Since then, he has shown to me in a group setting that we‚Äôre an item and he has also asked for my exclusivity. That‚Äôs how you know a man values you.

https://preview.redd.it/658bsgfld1p31.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5c33c083a171dfc531f306572d00db36f48240

When a man has found his dream girl, he will ditch his old ways and become the man that she expects to have. The woman who becomes a man‚Äôs dream girl is a woman that has standards. All of the strategies we‚Äôve talked about and will talk about in the future, the core of it is having standards and loving yourself enough to not accept any less. If you do this, your actions will subconsciously affect how a man perceives you and things are more likely to go your way. 

**So ladies, do not waver. Keep your frame. He can either take it or leave it. The right man will find you when you put in the time and effort to be a high quality woman. When you say no to things that are less than what you truly want, you make space in your life to welcome the things that you truly DO want.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d9t6c0/know_what_your_standards_are_and_stick_to_them/,1569546798.0,431,0.96,26,FemaleDatingStrategy,AverageToHot

&amp;#x200B;

* If you've initiated dates with a man (but he never initiates one with you), don't ask for advice on how to get him to initiate a date with you. Cut him off.
* If you've been the one predominantly initiating texts with him and he rarely texts you first, cut him off.
* If he's been leaving you on read and takes a day to get back to you, cut him off.
* If he doesn't make you feel special, cut him off.
* If he makes you feel frustrated because he can't plan a date well and offers a low value proposal, cut him off.
* If it's been 6 weeks of seeing each other continuously and he still hasn't shown that he wants to be in a relationship with you, cut him off. If he says he doesn't want a relationship with you, cut him off. He doesn't want one with you.

In short, if he hasn't been treating you like someone he values and someone he considers girlfriend material, cut him off. The established pattern will not change. If he comes running back promising he will change, don't believe him. He'll change for a bit before reverting back to how he once was.

It's easier to teach a new man how you'd like to be treated than to change a man who has learned that treating you like you're not special still gets him results. Start over with a new man instead of trying to change one.

Dating is a numbers game. Your time is better spent meeting a lot of new men, going on dates with them, cutting them off the moment they've shown they're not crazy for you THAN spending more time going out with someone who doesn't think you're special and who's just wasting his time with you because he's bored.

d5c6y9,"The guy I‚Äôm dating just asked to be FWB, so I blocked him on everything","I (25f) have been seeing this guy (23m) for about a month. I don‚Äôt normally date younger men, but his profile said he was older and I didn‚Äôt find out his true age until later. He seemed a little immature but I decided to give him a chance because he seemed really captivated by me, seemed to truly value me. I thought ‚Äúthis guy isn‚Äôt my usual type or preference but he likes me so much, it‚Äôs worth giving him a shot.‚Äù Basically, I lowered my standards for him. This was my first mistake.

I noticed that when I was with him he always talked about other girls he‚Äôd dated. Pretty much every other story he told was about a girl he‚Äôd dated or slept with. Furthermore, he always only talked about himself and never asked me anything about me or my life. He didn‚Äôt care to get to know me. Ignoring these red flags for too long was another huge mistake.

Something he shared with me was that he likes to be exclusive with the girls he‚Äôs very interested in and would cut things off if a girl he was seeing was dating other guys. He then claimed he himself had not been using his dating apps since he‚Äôd been talking to me. I decided to reciprocate and put all my profiles on snooze. Another blunder on my part.

A few weeks later I saw that he‚Äôd updated his Tinder profile, and got fed up. I decided to break things off, but he begged for another chance, insisting that he wasn‚Äôt actually using online dating apps. I normally wouldn‚Äôt even have cared this early on, but since he made such a big deal about it, and didn‚Äôt want me using the apps either, I was annoyed. Anyway, I don‚Äôt like being begged or guilted, so I gave him another shot. I was basically digging my own grave here. 

Not even a full two days after he begged for another chance, he asked if we could just be friends. I asked if he‚Äôd just decided he didn‚Äôt like me, to which he said no, that he still does but didn‚Äôt think we were compatible. I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested in staying friends, and he got upset. He said it didn‚Äôt have to end that way. He said ‚Äúwe could still hang out and have fun.‚Äù I said no. Then he said ‚ÄúCome on you‚Äôre so hot and I have sexual needs!‚Äù I was disgusted. I told him ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd ask me that. That‚Äôs horrible.‚Äù He replied ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not. Maybe to you it is.‚Äù He proceeded to tell me how childish it was that I didn‚Äôt want to stay friends. 

I blocked his number, removed and blocked him on Snapchat, and unmatched his profile on Tinder and Bumble. This guy was basically asking me to provide all the benefits of a girlfriend to him without me actually being his girlfriend. He wanted ME to tend to HIS needs without expecting anything in return. It felt so shitty. It made me feel like worthless garbage. 

I unfortunately can‚Äôt block numbers on my laptop, which I need for work and so I‚Äôm still able to see the texts he sends me. The first was a ‚Äúü•∫‚Äù the last was a ‚ÄúFuck you.‚Äù 

I hate men. They‚Äôre so fucking awful! But please learn from my mistakes, ladies, and don‚Äôt let men think they can walk all over you! If a guy isn‚Äôt acting right, leave ASAP!

d22vzv,Given That The Risks of Sex are WAY Higher and the Rewards WAY Lower for Women - a Man must bring something else to the table to level the playing field.,"First off, a fundamental law of nature is that Pussy has value, and dick doesn‚Äôt. There is a reason why the females are usually the choosier sex - any sexual engagement with males comes with high risk and limited reward. 

For example:

&amp;nbsp;

-  **Men and Women do not carry equal risk of engagement during sex**. Your risks as a woman who engages in an encounter with a new man are always WAY higher than the reverse. Women are more physically more susceptible to STDs that can severely effect our fertility (such as HPV). We also carry the risk of unwanted pregnancy, abortion, effects of birth control, rape, etc. As women we carry waaaaay more risk in casual sexual encounters with men,  and it's absurd liberal feminists try to pretend othwerise. 

&amp;nbsp;

-  **Women do not orgasms at the rate and frequency of men.** The rewards of sex for women are usually a lot lower than for men. Men orgasm most times they have sex, this is not the case for straight women, who cannot be guaranteed an orgasm in any sexual encounter, either from the lack of skill or lack of care from their partner. 

&amp;nbsp;

- **The Social consequences for sex are higher for women due to sexism.** It‚Äôs not fair - but it‚Äôs true. If things go south - You‚Äôll be looked At badly and take most of the blame.

&amp;nbsp;

- **You will reinforce poor behavior by having sex with men you haven't vetted.** Most men you encounter will always put the bare minimum effort he can get away with and still get sex. Slanging pussy to fuckboys creates male entitlement and reinforces their sexist worldview by making them their strategies are effective.

&amp;nbsp;

Trying to Prove You‚Äôre An ‚ÄúEmpowered Woman‚Äù B  Having No Strings Attached &amp; Emotionless Sex ‚ÄúLike A Man‚Äù is Selling Yourself Short. The fact is, men explicitly state they have no reason to care about you as a person, much less care if you even enjoyed the sexual encounter.

&amp;nbsp;

As is, It‚Äôs not a fair trade. Women are trading down and men are trading up every time because women have got way more to lose and far less to gain. Therefore, we assert that casual sex with men without some kind of extra tangible benefit is an uneven exchange at women's expense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/d22vzv/given_that_the_risks_of_sex_are_way_higher_and/,1568091221.0,372,0.93,68,FemaleDatingStrategy,TheOGJammies

nz6con,Josh Duggar: Porn to CP/CSAM Pipeline (Trigger Warning),"
I‚Äôve just finished watching several videos on this case and it‚Äôs yet again another example of how porn addiction has a strong correlation with engaging in CSAM. Before hearing all the details I was like mm hmm, yup, text book porn addict. The last info I read on him was that he actually was a full blown porn addict at 14.

I‚Äôve listened/read other stories where they follow the same template that Josh did. We all vaguely remember he molested his sisters about 20 years ago. And then got caught using a cheating website: Ashley Madison. Since then I didn‚Äôt really remember who he was until about a month ago the FBI arrested him for distributing/downloading CSAM.

Other details were expelled such as him contracting prostitutes from the strip club etc. 

The typical outline:

Porn...Porn Addiction...Cheating...Prostitutes...CSAM

Josh was already abusing children at the age 15 (5 girls). Since it was probably forbidden to have a gf in their secular beliefs he fast forwarded to child abuse and then he engaged in the rest after. I hope he rots in prison.

I used to be with a PA, (horrendous experience btw) and vaguely knowing that they may start to like children made me sick. Definitely was the major factor in leaving him.

nz5a5t,Society needs to stop enabling these LVM‚Äôs,"One thing I‚Äôm sure many of you have noticed is how enabled LVM/NVM‚Äôs are compared to women. It really needs to stop. Why do you think this continues to happen? Do you have any examples? Here‚Äôs a few I‚Äôd like to share:

My elderly ex-MIL let my ex husband move in with her because living on his own was ‚Äúhard‚Äù. She pays all the bills/cooks dinner/takes care of this almost 40 year old loser.

A very successful woman friend of mine got married and had a couple of kids with a guy who seemed great at first. Then he quit his job out of nowhere in order to pursue his dream. And it‚Äôs a stupid dream that can‚Äôt succeed (similar to selling scuba diving gear in Kansas). Instead of leaving him she turned around and sunk $50k into ‚Äúsupporting his dream‚Äù. Now he barely works and spends all his time tinkering with his hobbies. She works 60+ hours a week WTF?!

It‚Äôs not just women that do it. I know another LVM that refused to work. Charged his fast food, bar drinks, etc. to a credit card that his dad would pay off for him. We‚Äôre talking $10k every few months. 

Can‚Äôt tell you how many Reddit posts I‚Äôve seen where daughters are expected to clean and contribute and then are then kicked out at 18 - while their brothers don‚Äôt have to lift a finger and can live there for as long as they want.

nz3aqv,"To my NVX's ex - I am so sorry. I was a raging pickme, and you were a Queen all along.","Dear M, 

You and Scrote shared years of your life together. You went through undergrad, then medical school, working towards trying to become a doctor. You did all this while entertaining him and his friends at your apartment when they would come to your university because it was a party town, and you would host them every other weekend. You had a great group of doctor friends, friends you exercised with, and a family that loved you and supported you. 

When you and Scrote were expecting a baby daughter, did you REALLY trap him? Did he REALLY say he didn't want a child? Or is that just what he told me to paint a picture of you as ""Completely Evil Man-Trapping Spermjacker"" to me, a naive 19-year-old? 

You know, because I was sooo MaTuRe FoR mY aGe and YoU'Re NoT lIkE oThEr GiRlS. 

When Scrote told me that you were a wrinkly old lady, with an ugly body and an ugly, aging face, I should have immediately taken that to be a red flag. No man who speaks about the mother of his child in such a disrespectful way should have the pleasure of having a woman in his company. Instead, I decided to snoop your LinkedIn profile and was shocked to see that you were none of these. You were a beautiful, successful doctor with her own practice in her late 30s who was absolutely glowing. 

And truth was, I was jealous of you. 

I know you were freaked out that I looked you up, because on LinkedIn you can see who searched you. But I had to know who you were, what you looked like. Every time we spoke about our exes, Scrote would always put you down in some way that I couldn't fathom why a guy like Scrote would have even bothered to be with you, let alone have a baby with you. 

I wish I could have been mature enough to reach out to you. Maybe I could have prevented wasting five years with Scrote if I had just known how he treated you during your relationship. There were so many parallels between your story and my story, which confirms to me that he was a trash man then, and is probably still a trash man now. 

On your first day at your new job, he printed out a bumper sticker that said ""Honk for the Whore in the Driver's Seat"" and secretly taped it to your trunk. Everyone honked at you all day in rush hour traffic and you didn't understand why. He tells me that when you got home that day he laughed and laughed at you, and he told me that you laughed at it, too. Did you? 

You were a runner your whole life and it was a huge part of your fitness routine. He would constantly tell me that no matter how much you ran, you always had a 'fat mom ass' and that your joints would grind down to nothing by the time you turned 40.

When you were in medical school and were being stalked by another student on campus, instead of helping call campus security or helping you feel reassured and safe, Scrote told you that you were overreacting and probably doing it to get attention. 

When you finally couldn't take it no more and cheated (or did you, really? Or is the cheating story yet another lie he told me about you?) with another doctor at your work, eventually leaving Scrote for him, Scrote began harassing you and manipulating you, and acting out like a petulant child (yes, I read the legal case. What he did to you, he did to me, too). 

He stalked you, drove with you and the baby in the car at high speeds. 

He bullied you, talked down to you, and denied you your complete personality. 

I know this, because he did the same to me. 

Everything he did to you, he did to me, too. 

I was just a dumb, inexperienced young woman who was just so happy to get picked that I didn't see how much pain that he had caused you for years. I was happy to let the curtain stay closed, even though I knew what was behind it - hell, I was going through it myself! Why couldn't I see it then? Why was I so blind then? And...god, you shared a child with him. He claimed that he never wanted to be a dad and that you were an evil woman for trapping him...but then he fought you in court for years trying to get custody of your daughter. 

He won. He won alternate weekends with her and every other holiday. Did you know that while he was dating me, he always referred to your shared daughter as a ""visiting relative?"" That her presence in his life wouldn't affect how our own relationship would move along as a result? Who talks about their child like that? 

A SCROTE. Your ex is a scrote, and I dated him, too. That we have in common. 

M, I've never met you. I've always thought about what I would say if I ever ran into you in public, or something like that. Sometimes I fantasize about finally working up the courage to message you, to apologize for all the hateful, hurtful things I believed about you. I only listened to one side of the story as it suited me, and molded you into the evil woman I needed you to be. 

But you're not that woman. You were just a woman trying to live her life with a NVM, until you made him a NVX; which makes you a QUEEN. From what I can see, your life has gone nowhere but up since leaving him. 

That, too, we have in common.

I find it so very difficult to type this out, but I am writing this unsent letter in the hopes that other young girls/women on FDS will see how I used to feel, and how I feel now, about my NVX's ex. 

Many older men with histories, with several ex-gf/wives, will have no qualms about finding themselves an inexperienced, emotionally immature teenager/young woman so they can exert their control over her. Often, to gas up their age-gap bride, they will dump all over their previous, age-appropriate exes. YOU'RE not like my crone ex-gf. YOU'RE younger/prettier/hotter/more fuckable. YOU get me. YOU make me feel young. YOU make me feel like a man. 

Just know that you're only getting ONE side of the story, and it's not the woman's side. 

M, I am so sorry for any pain or hurt that I've caused you by being complicit in Scrote's absolute slander of you and your character. I just want you to know that I've done some major growing up, but I find myself thinking about you from time to time even though I don't think about Scrote anymore. I hope you continue being a strong, strong Queen, and that your daughter turns out to be just like you. 

All my best, Twerk.

nz2rwg,Ask a man why he loves you,"This is the ultimate LVM v HVM test. 

LVM will say, ""You stuck with me through everything, you understand me, you would be the perfect mother to my kids, you know how to please me, you always do nice things for me."" This might seem nice, but it isn't. Pay closer attention. It's all about him and what you do for him. Of course, a little bit about himself is normal and expected. But if all he can say is what you do for him, then he doesn't see all your beauty and power, and only views you as an accessory for himself. A man who really loves you will be able to see you as yourself, not just how you benefit him. 

Think about it. When we love a man, yes, we demand to be treated with respect, but that's the bare minimum. He has to bring something else too, be extraordinary in some way. When a man asks why we love him, we never say, ""You support me and help me."" We praise something like his intelligence, or his empathy for other people, or his spiritual strength. In short, we see him as more than an accessory, and that's the very reason ""Nice Guys"" are so confused, because they have to be more than just decent if we're going to love them. We need to demand that men see us the same way. No more saying you love me because I'm a good servant. It needs to be about me, not about you. 

A HVM will say you are brilliant, or extraordinary in some way. He will tell you what it is about YOU that makes you special. It won't be about him, and you won't just be an accessory. This shows he views you as your own person, and not just in relation to him. And he loves what he sees. Don't accept a man who doesn't see your value. Don't be with a misogynistic narcissist.

‚Ä¢ fit with big thighs and broad back

‚Ä¢ minimum 6‚Äù dick, minimum 2‚Äù girth


What bothered me was one of my friend‚Äôs responses. Now, she‚Äôs a brilliant, smart women and never ceases to amaze me everyday. I really admire her, she‚Äôs beautiful and hard-working.

She replied though, saying that these were unhealthy expectations, and she knew that because she studied it in her psych class (we‚Äôre in college). She then went on to say that it‚Äôs okay to be lenient on the physical aspects because you don‚Äôt know what you could end up being attracted to. I agreed with that part, of course the physical attributes that attract me are very varied, but this list is meant to be like the GOLDEN standard.

Then she added that this kind of man will have physical expectations that they will hold me to and that could be a really awful feeling. While that is right too, the standards I made for this golden standard man is literally my equivalent. 

I am very physically fit as a dancer and gym-goer, I am beginning my postgrad in a few months to become a lawyer, I went through braces, made it a point to have healthy male and female friendships and I KNOW my coochie is paradise. I only made a list creating essentially the male version of myself. So to hear that it was ‚Äúunhealthy expectations‚Äù was kind of upsetting.

Like, even a man who is fugly as hell often demands to date Adriana Lima so the whole ‚Äúhe will have expectations of you‚Äù kind of flats flat. Another thing is, to a certain extent, I would prefer a man with standards unlike the scrote who goes after any and everyone. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with what she said but my reaction was very much, ‚Äúwhat the fuck does that have to do with this.‚Äù

I created a list of standards (not including everything I wanted, like matching political and moral beliefs etc.) and I was told that they were unhealthy expectations? It‚Äôs literally me if I was a man, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything unhealthy in expecting someone like myself. 

Anyway, ladies, please tell me your list and know that I won‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs unhealthy expectations! Let me hear it, whether you go crazy for the soft bods or Hemsworth-worthy abs, if you prefer someone chatty or silent?",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nz0o2a/kind_of_peeved_after_build_a_man/,1623603364.0,346,0.88,86,FemaleDatingStrategy,sleepysiri

nyxqp1,"Rant - Floating Like a Cork In the Water and the Bullshit of ""Letting Go""","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best when it comes to reality.  I've been sober for a bit and a fan of meditation so, I'm getting better at it, but...

I've got a gripe about this idea of ""letting go"" and learning to accept reality ""as-is"".  I'm reading a self-help book now that hammers in the point, but I've also attended Al-Anon and read other self-help books with the same theme.  The focus is always on accepting reality ""as-is"" but there is another few steps that get muted.  I don't know if its because most people just can't accept reality, so the authors stress that point hard, but the steps are:

1)  Awareness (is there a problem?)

2)  Acceptance (of reality)

3) Evaluation (Can I do anything about it?)

4) Action (If anything can be done)

I (and many of the other women in my very religious family) stop around step 3 and default to ""this is God's will"", ""this is the will of the universe"", ""I should be grateful for these lessons"").  That's the bullshit part - that's not an evaluation, that's just ""sucking it up"" in every situation.  

That learned helplessness or deferral of all personal responsibilities to a Higher Power kept me in an abusive marriage and also led me to my substance abuse problem.

nyx49z,Please take the time to figure out what your inner 'romantic narrative' is.,"Hi ladies!

I was struggling to fall asleep last night for the first time in a while, and I was having one of my days where I'm just especially saddened by male depravity, so decided to resort to my teenage coping mechanism of telling myself a story to fall asleep. When I was younger, I used to spend hours daydreaming about my perfect man, and where and how we'd meet etc, but since the start of my FDS journey, it's near impossible (thank God tbh). Sometimes I still like to do it, as my main hobby is writing, and I find it can inspire stories. But I realised something last night: my own fantasies always involve a 'friends turned to lovers' plot. 

And then it hit me - that's my inner romantic narrative! 

It's the story I tell myself of how love *should* be. I think lots of us do it (or more so, did it) unknowingly. Do you ever talk to a pickmeisha and she talks about how she loves a 'bad boy' and they complain about X being 'too nice.' (I'm specifically thinking of people on First Dates here.) Or a different type in an off again/on again relationship convinced that they're Ross and Rachel, and therefore meant to be together? It's the same thing, different story.

I did a bit more thinking about it, and it's very obviously from the media I consumed growing up, and in my late teenage years. For example, I used to love Jim and Pam from The Office, or Leslie and Ben from Parks and Recreation (I still do, but we move). It's a standard storyline in comedies and detective shows, it seems. I can also see how someone who loves reality TV could come out with a desire to tame a bad boy, or a conviction that marriage is the most important of life from reading too many classics. We only have to look at the impact the fwb movies had on our 'hook up' culture today to see how deep these story lines affect us. 

I think a lot of us this is common knowledge, and I've read a lot of brilliant discussion on this sub about the impact media has had us in many ways. I never realised how much this inner narrative has affected my life, though. All my relationships sprung out of 'friendships' (as if they were ever friendships), and I have a habit of getting into complicated and questionable friendships with men, where the lines are always blurred. But I've always seemed to be fuckboi-proof, and I can see through love-bombing straight away (if he's too good to be true, I'm gone.) It's always confused me a lot, and now I can see why. 

These narratives we carry are our vulnerability, the entry point for the ""right sort"" of LVM if we're not careful. However I think this one is as easy to sort out as it is getting rid of a crush. This excellent post is just amazing for those of us still on our level up journey. [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/n3r4fa/how\_to\_use\_crushes\_to\_our\_advantage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/n3r4fa/how_to_use_crushes_to_our_advantage/)

From that, what  I suggest with dealing with your inner romantic narrative is this:

1. Identify it, and recognise the patterns in your dating history it may have caused. 
2. Remind yourself that it is a plot device, used to lengthen a series, and keep audiences hooked, whatever it is. Remind yourself that real love is usually so boring to a viewer, or so uncomfortable for a pickmeisha to acknowledge as real love in the face of her reality, that nobody would watch it. 
3. Really try to think about what shows, books and movies your narrative was derived from, and reevaluate their value, and compare them to your reality. For example, Jim and Pam are relatable to so many because their relationship is so flawed and low effort, and doesn't make people uncomfortable to watch. My work place relationships (I was a teenager in a hotel, forgive me!) were so cringe and forced I would rather die than repeat them. 
4. Now that you've realised how little value this brings you, identify what it is exactly that attracts you to it. Is it passion, love, a feeling of achievement, the low amount of effort you'd be required to make to get it, etc, and think about how you can implement it into your life as is. With mine, I can tell that the low effort aspect is a big enticement, as is the recognition of my personality rather than my looks. So, instead of looking for friendship, I should recognise and accept that I'm not the sort of person suited for going on a couple of dates every week, and that I shouldn't give guys drawn to my looks a chance. A woman who is attracted to the bad boy type is probably chasing a feeling of achievement, of getting someone who doesn't want to settle down to settle down, and should maybe look into other ways of feeling more fulfilled. A woman drawn to on/off relationships could inject more excitement in her life through a thrilling hobby...
5. Now throw the whole script away, it's bullshit. You've extracted the little value your narrative had, and now just forget about it. Real love isn't what you see in movies.

lxzm94,Now I understand the men of OLD,"I've been looking for a used car online and that's shockingly similar to OLD. There's a picture of the car, the car's facts like mileage, make, model, features, etc. You even have to message to see if the car you like is still available before you go for a test drive. Anyway, you may not know this but just like there are lots of catfish and bot profiles, there are tons of fake car profiles. They promise you an amazing, cheap car with a late model year and all the features. Then when you get there, no car and they try to sell you horrible cars for a lot more money. As I was scanning cars today, I had a revelation. 

You see, after a little experience it's easy to spot a fake car profile. The car is just over-the-top, too good to be true. But the reason they get clicks is because *people don't want what they can afford.* A Maserati is a real car. They exist. But no one on earth is selling a 2021 Maserati fully loaded for $8,000. *Bugs Bunny meme* Nooooooo. Nobody but a massive narcissist is going to fall for that. Everyone else has the self awareness to realize this can't be real life. But the narc thinks ""of course, I *deserve* a Maserati, so the earth has shifted on its axis to get me one."" Men on OLD don't want to pay the piper. There is a type of woman out there that suits everyone's taste. That's not the issue. The issue is a beautiful, brilliant, witty, charming, educated woman is not going to queue up to go 50/50 with Jabba the Scrote, except in his dreams. Yes, it is entirely possible to find the woman of your dreams online-but you have to bring something to the table besides the audacity. Men like to talk a big game about women ""depreciating"", but they fail to realize in the dating game, everyone is assigned a value. And the main scrotes talking have a dating value that entitles them only to-*checks spreadsheet* a dried up orange with a hole in it as a partner. But rather than work on themselves, they continue to focus on obviously fake profiles, which they secretly know will keep them in a holding pattern. They know the ""girl"" with a model photo up is never going to meet them in real life. But that image is what they think they deserve. So they'd rather be at home, talking to an AI robot with a cute photo than to face the reality that the girl who that photo belongs to would never talk to them in a million years. You never see that type of guy out talking to pretty girls in the real world, do you? Dating sites may make bots to stay in business but men only fall for them because of hubris. Maseratis exist but 95% of people can't afford them. Fantastic women exist, but the truth is they want an equal partner-so most men can't afford them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lxzm94/now_i_understand_the_men_of_old/,1614904122.0,250,0.97,25,FemaleDatingStrategy,Throwawayrightaway28

lxxo91,Does anyone else find it so hard and cringey when reading other dating subs?,"Hi wonderful sisters!

So I had to put this out there. Now that I know the true nature of most men, it's like a feeling of frustration and sadness when I read posts from women seeking advice on other subs.

- ""It's been three months and he's doing the slow fade"" This means that the sex honeymoon is over and he's bored and wants something shiny and new. 


- ""He ghosted after three great dates"" This means he is one of those douches who thinks that sex is on the table after three dates. The good old ""three date rule"".


- ""He's not showing interest after we got intimate, I didn't sleep with him but we kissed and touched"" This means he can't be bothered as it's too much work to get actual sex. Or it hurt his poor ego because he felt ""seduced"" and got hard but then it all stopped, the poor baby. 


- ""He won't introduce me to his family, but says he really likes me and wants to see where it goes""
Most males won't say no to reliable sex, even if they don't actually like you. Some don't even care if they are that physically attracted, it's sex right!!


But the thing is, I'll get down votes galore if I actually say these things. Knowing the truth is frustrating and hard. This is not to say that all of my examples are 100 percent correct.

lxlvxo,The process,"I had a dream last night I was on a first date with this huge football player (??) and I had to run an errand and someone I know, slept with him and said that she couldn't help it, she liked him a lot. I cussed her out and left. He approached me and was apologetic and I forgave him. And I took him back. I woke up and thought, ""I'm still a pickmesha in my dreams""  


The reason I bring this up, after being single (post-divorce) for 2 years and no relationships, I find myself longing for ""someone"" to feel a connection with. But I also recognize this is what puts me in bad relationships. Just ""needing to be close"" to another human. The eventual need for intimacy blinds me to everything. I know that.

lxkiei,The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart by Holly Ringland,"First of all, this is a fictional book. I also haven't read it the entire way through, but I would like to recommend it to you all.

The first fourth of the book is fairly sickening, an abusive husband and father, a negligent mother, and a little girl who is stuck in the middle of the chaos. Because of certain events though, she is sent to her grandmother's place, which is probably what all of you would imagine to be a dream home.

In this house, there are several women, all of whom had troubles in their past but are now recovering and becoming better people. They work on their own farm which produces flowers, one of them is the designated cook, and if for some reason a baby comes along the way they take care of it together. They also have a little workshop where everyone has their own space for their hobbies.

lxb2d0,Straight from the horses mouth.,"Overheard a conversation today that the ladies may be interested in, especially those who are long term girlfriends and the like. 

A man, who comes in regularly and knows my coworkers, came into the shop I work at and was having a discussion about buying a house vs renting with my coworker (also male, recently bought a house with gf). 

Discussion goes on, reveals him and his gf are looking at buy houses but gf wants ‚Äòdream home‚Äô. Which given the area we are, types of houses I doubt anyone would find their ‚Äòdream home‚Äô here but I digress. 

The discussion soon came to the conclusion that the money that was going into the house was the mans money either way (‚Äònot that she doesn‚Äôt contribute‚Äô). However bc it IS his money, his name will be on the mortgage and etc. basically she can take or leave what he decides. 

This. THIS. Is exactly why any and every woman should have their OWN shit. Your own money set aside, your own house to buy, all your OWN shit bc at the end of the day when this woman moves in with this man she will literally have nothing and no say, even after spending time and money to contribute to it and make it a home. He at one point said about moving to whatever new place; ‚Äòwhy wouldn‚Äôt she?‚Äô As if he‚Äôs some kind of extra special prize bc he‚Äôs ALLOWING her to live with him and share the experience. 

At one point I couldn‚Äôt stand it any longer and replied to the ‚Äòwhy wouldn‚Äôt she?‚Äô With like ‚ÄòWhy WOULD she, she has no security in that relationship??‚Äô 

Of course it was brushed aside bc what could I possibly know. Especially about the depravity of a man who clearly is taken care of by his gf, she is thinking about a long term future etc.  Honestly when it comes down to it, from an outside perspective of course, it really seems this man doesn‚Äôt give a shit about her. Especially mentioning that ‚Äòif she doesn‚Äôt like it she can leave‚Äô. 

Do not put faith in these ‚Äòplaying house‚Äô relationships. 

Do NOT EVER move into a mans owned house without being on the lease or mortgage. 

And for damn sure do NOT become that live in, long term gf who can be dropped the minute, that man gets bored or decides for whatever reason that you ain‚Äôt it sis, and you‚Äôll have nothing to show for it except wasted time and possible heartbreak. 

Edit: how many want to bet that as soon as anything comes up in that household or even relationship it‚Äôs going to be WELL ITS MY HOUSE!! üôÑ

lx9rjq,NVM vs HVM,"Left my husband a year ago. Curious to see what is lurking out there in online dating so I made an account a few days ago. Gave only the required basics like age, marital status, etc. No picture, no additional info. Nothing. 

I already have a message from some man. I mean, seriously? He just needed to know I have a pulse (not even guaranteed really) and he's establishing contact?? Meanwhile in my pick me days, I would've been so touched that the guy wasn't obsessed with the way I look. Lord ü§¶

Meanwhile, I have two (seemingly, time will tell) HVM at work. One of them is relatively new. He's always polite and respectful, offers to help in any way he can (and follows through!) and often tells me how much he appreciates my work and training him. He even brought me chocolate one day as a thank you. 

I told the other HVM (we are good friends) about this and mentioned how weird I thought it was. And his response? ""Yeah I mean I guess it's weird, orrrr maybe your standards are so low that any nice thing seems weird"" OUCH. I sat with that for a second and then cautiously agreed, okay, I can see that. And THEN he goes on to say ""I'm not blaming you, it's society that put the bar so low"" and I'm over here like JFC it's so fucking true. Then I told him he didn't have to call me out quite like that and he apologized. 

So. Yeah. Seeing it in action, HVM want us to have standards. My mind is blown.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lx9rjq/nvm_vs_hvm/,1614822441.0,210,0.88,23,FemaleDatingStrategy,blue_nirvana

lx3av4,Historical perspective on why we can't have nice things.,"The whole ideal of the Atomic Age nuclear family was built on women as a class sacrificing themselves for the benefit of men. Our society was architected so that unskilled working class men could support a family on one income and women lacked key financial freedoms that kept them dependent on men.

Historical background: the Atomic Age started in the post New Deal era in the late 1930's and peaked in the 1950's. The harbinger of it's end was a push towards corporate dysregulation that started in the 1970's and culminated in Regan era fiscal policy. It was a period of enthusiasm, technical innovation, the rise of the middle class and yes it was the period when we build most of our nuclear infrastructure in America which was considered an ideal form of clean energy and technical innovation. The phrase nuclear family clearly has it's root in the cultural milieu of this time period. It is honestly a really special historical period for art and design as well and it's also been the fodder for a lot of dark reimagining (see Fallout franchise).

A very large portion of our society still idealizes this fantasy even though the social safety nets for men through affirmative labor policies that made this ideal possible have been stripped away for the last half a decade. Globalization means all our unskilled work goes overseas and corporate oligarchs sacrificed the tax structures that balanced the economy for working class earners in order to enrich their own coffers.

Now men want to blame women for the state of society-- because like any good American they are trained to seek out under-privileged groups to blame for social ills caused by unchecked capitalism-- and to continue benefitting from women as if the social contract that made the Atomic Age nuclear family was still in effect. It's worth mentioning that while men in the 1950's didn't respect their female partners as equals, they also did not engage in the fervor of unchecked male supremacy and misogynistic hate than men today engage in.

Women are waking up to the fact that partnering with a man suffering under those dual delusions in a tough economy is a complete liability and naturally refusing to go along with it. We are living in the death throws of end state capitalism and it's unclear what the future will hold. We used to think that overpopulation would be the death of humanity but it's becoming clear that any sufficiently industrialized society will have a steep drop off in birth rates because of the above elements coming into play. Manufacturing jobs are never coming back and oil and gas (another industry that employs and enriches mostly men) is also going the way of the dodo. 

Who knows what the future holds. I personally believe in a sustainable future, and I think that our path forward is going to look a lot different when the boomer generation finally becomes irrelevant. I think people in the Gen-Z generation, no matter their gendered leanings, are going to be more in favor of straight up redistributing wealth and resources because it doesn't seem like the old model of putting one class to work and trying to cut down the rest is going to work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lx3av4/historical_perspective_on_why_we_cant_have_nice/,1614802693.0,229,0.93,16,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

lwut1f,Men who lie about their careers,"I‚Äôm seeing an alarming trend of the amount of men that actively lie about their careers/what they do for a living. This is happening so frequently that I thought making a post about it would be appropriate since I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one facing this issue.

Men will lie about *everything*. Eve ry thing. The lie that really gets on my nerves is the men who lie about their careers or embellish what they actually do in order to impress me.

Here‚Äôs a few stories:

Exhibit A: ‚ÄúThe military guy.‚Äù

Claims he‚Äôs an ‚Äúengineer‚Äù. Refuses to mention that he‚Äôs actually a combat engineer. Lies about his level of education, claims to have an undergraduate degree but is actually a high school drop out. Makes it sound like he‚Äôs rolling in dough, when he‚Äôs actually making no more than 56K CAD a year. This information is public, you can look up all the salaries for government employees in my country.

The pickmeisha in me actually gave this person a chance because they made it sound like they were ambitious and had bigger goals for themselves. Their circle of friends was closely knit, and he was respectful until the ball finally dropped and his true colours came out. 

Exhibit B: ‚ÄúThe lawyer.‚Äù

This happened recently, and by recently I mean last night. Met this guy through OLD, seemed normal and gave me my space. He was quite direct with asking me out on a proper date immediately, and I obliged because there were no red flags exhibited.

He claims he‚Äôs a lawyer. This is total bullshit. He never wrote the bar, and this information is easily verifiable. To test him, I asked him simple questions like ‚ÄúOh, what did you do your undergrad in before you went on to graduate/law school?‚Äù. Claims he never did anything past
his undergrad, and got bad grades while he was at it anyways. He also claimed the system was different in the province he went to school with, which ended up being a lie. He claims he went to school in province B, then finally slipped up and told me he went to school in province A.

If he went to school in province A (current province we‚Äôre in), there is absolutely no way he would become a lawyer unless he wrote the bar. He‚Äôs actually legal counsel which is a glorified law clerk where he works, but he never wanted to admit it.

I won‚Äôt even talk about how awful the date was last night and the bad vibes I got from him. He had the audacity to text me this morning asking to see me again, lol. I did not give any indication of interest so he‚Äôs clearly as delusional as the stories he‚Äôs making up about his life.

Moral of the story is, if you have any inkling that a man is lying about what he does for a living, run. There‚Äôs nothing worse than a liar. I understand that many people are embarrassed with what they‚Äôre currently doing for a living at a certain stage in their life, but there‚Äôs absolutely no need to lie about it. In fact, I admire people who are honest about their struggles. I would rather date someone who is honest about being a janitor, for example, and showing their ambition by putting themselves through school.

A man who will easily lie and embellish their career is one to avoid at all costs.

All the comments she gets are either love/ hate.  Most of her content is her spewing controversial stuff or doing ""tradwife stuff"" like cleaning and cooking for her husband while beating other women up for their life choices and shaming them.

Although she's as fascinating to watch when you think she is trolling, the fascination runs out and is replaced by a slowly creeping repulsion when delving deeper into her ""content"".

How can such a **hateful** human being exist?

Some say they want to be like her one day, some say she is joking because this can't be real.

Unfortunately, she is not joking. In this video alone she acts like she's pro-rape. This is alarming and terrifying to see and more alarming are her supporters who hate women.

She is an anti-mask conservative with a neo-nazi streak,  a white-supremacist, anti-LGBTQ, antifeminist,  ""prolifer"" who endorses the death penalty (hypocritical much?). She shames non-tradwives, gender equality and she's spreading misinformation and ""educating"" young girls into choosing this ""lifestyle"".

lwpgpp,How has FDS affected your live otherwise than dating?,"This question ran to my mind in the daily basis; I‚Äôm trying to order jeans online. In my pickme-days I would have ‚Äùbe ok‚Äù that size that fits, but not perfectly, because I would be too tired to exchange it. But now I‚Äôm ordering and re-ordering/exhancing until it‚Äôs perfect! 

Same with other things. My friend (kind of pickmeisha) told the thing I wanted to do is stupid and not so adult-like. I just dont care anymore about their opinions. I did it anyway. No harm to anyone, maybe to my wallet but that‚Äôs my problem. A short time back I would have ‚Äùbelieved‚Äù my friend and staying in the pick-me mode and think if doing what I wanted caused me to look bad to others...

Basically FDS has boosted my self-esteem that I don‚Äôt care anymore about what other people think about how I live my life.

lwisxh,"Misogynistic men are misogynistic because 1) they are male, and raised in a culture that is male supremacist, and 2) they benefit from the oppression of women. Not because they are ""all secretly gay""","*sigh*

I can't believe I have to make a post about this.

It's such a ridiculous and false narrative, but I feel like I *have* to respond, because this narrative is being used to radicalize people into believing that women who use FDS deserve to be abused and harassed off of this platform. 

We are the last female-only sub on a male-dominated platform and that has made us into the lightning rod for allll the misogynists on reddit who feel in need of a punching bag.

I was disappointed but not surprised by the amount of abusive, misogynistic, and frankly downright *cruel* harassment I received after my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lvgbp6/female_dating_strategy_is_not_heteronormative/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), almost exclusively from men and AMAB members of the LGBT community. [(Example)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FDSSuperFans/comments/lwd106/sent_from_our_stalker_subreddit_this_was_in_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

The recurring theme in all of them, is that they seem to believe that FDS promotes the (ridiculous) idea that homosexuality is the cause of all misogyny. 

What they are referring to is the ""radfem circular theory of homosexuality"" which is the bread and butter of our #1 Stalker Subreddit, and it is why they feel morally justified inciting targeted harassment campaigns against a subreddit full of abused and traumatized women.

**They write, ""radfems believe that men are gay because they are misogynists, and men are misogynists because they are gay""**

That statement is COMPLETELY false. No FDS user has ever actually said that or anything close.

Their ""evidence"" consists of a handful of (mostly deleted or removed) comments, most from over a year ago, most with very few upvotes, taken out of context, twisted to mean something completely different, and then with an entirely new narrative written around it using passages from radical feminists we never even mentioned. Similar logic as *""you know who else drank water? HITLER! Therefore water is fascist""* except somehow even more far removed from reality. 

FYI, the context of the OP on FDS is always something like ""gay men can be misogynistic sometimes"" which is a well-documented fact. Gay men CAN be misogynistic sometimes. Being LGBT doesn't give you a pass for being a misogynist.

It's very common for abusive and/or narcissistic people to do the whole, ""if I can't control you, I will try to control how others see you"" tactic.

In light of these false accusations, I'd like to set the record straight and communicate what we *actually* believe:

#Misogynistic men are misogynistic because 1) they are male, and raised in a culture that is male supremacist, and 2) they benefit from the oppression of women. Regardless of one's gender identity or sexual orientation, all persons born and raised male are socialized to enjoy male privilege and are raised to feel entitled to female subordination. They feel entitled to use misogyny and even abuse to maintain their position of relative power over women.

To be fair, I'm sure that there may be some among our stalker subs who genuinely believe that they are fighting hatred and bigotry. And to give credit where credit is due, some of these stalker subreddits do occasionally pay lip service to misogyny on reddit. 

Nevertheless, their tactics are unethical because 1) they are relying on deceit and misrepresentation, and 2) **they are capitalizing on the pre-existing culture of misogyny on reddit.** Anti-FDS posts get waaay more upvotes and engagement than anti-misogyny posts, so they are incentivized to keep making them. Because reddit is mostly male, and because misogynist trolls also browse their subs, every time they make an anti-FDS post, they are inviting misogynists to dogpile us with the abusive modmail/DMs/comments and malicious mass reporting. The end result is that an anti-FDS post has a greater potential to incite a greater volume of harassment against a smaller and more marginalized group, whereas an anti-misogyny post incites hardly any harassment, and even if it does, it's against a much larger and more dominant group. 

I'd like to point out that as women who moderate the only female-only sub on a misogynistic platform such as reddit, we unfortunately have to work way harder than moderators of any other subreddit just to keep our subreddit afloat. So much of our time is spent JUST on anti-harassment, keeping this sub female-only, and preventing our sub from getting overrun by trolls (flairing users, manually approving every post, combing through an avalanche of abusive modmail just to find the 0.01% of legitimate users who accidentally got caught up in autoban, etc.) and that shit is fucking time consuming!

I'd also like to point out that our moderator team are all either women of color, working class women, and/or survivors of childhood abuse, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence. For people who seem to all be hopping on the ""anti hate"" bandwagon; from our perspective, all we see are a large group of people who are mostly white and mostly male spewing vitriolic hatred towards a much smaller group of marginalized women, and creating tons of extra work for us. 

Like... we don't get paid to moderate on reddit. We have to work actual jobs to keep a roof over our head. We've got maybe, what? Less than a dozen active mods? Trying to stand up to millions of pissed off redditors, some of whom apparently don't have jobs and instead have the privilege of working the equivalent of a full-time job harassing women on reddit? Wow. 

I'm sure many of you have these massive delusions of grandeur and see yourselves as brave social justice warriors, noble soldiers fighting for a righteous cause, but the reality is that you're part of the problem. We don't see you as anything other than just another loser desperately clinging to patriarchy because you have nothing going for you in life other than having a white penis. You are a member of the oppressor class, so stop playing the victim. 

Lastly, I'm sure the smoothbrains feeling *particularly defensive* right now are gonna go and crosspost this to all our other stalker subs and cry ""FDS mod does personalized harassment campaign at me!! Waaah!"" and I just want to point out that I have not ONCE directly mentioned any specific usernames or subreddits, in this post or any other. Unlike what *you* do, FDS has a strict antibrigading policy. Unlike you, we don't allow anything that would allow our users here to know who you are or have any way to contact you. Unlike you, we don't encourage our users to obsessively stalk and mass report everything you write. Unlike you, we actually have integrity and we try to protect your privacy, even if you do not show us the same courtesy. If you choose to out yourself by saying ""I wrote that!"" then that's a *you* problem, not us. Stop lying, projecting, and derailing. You speak exactly like a narcissistic abuser. You don't get to systematically stalk and harass our moderator team and our community for over a year and then play the victim when we call you out for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lwisxh/misogynistic_men_are_misogynistic_because_1_they/,1614737980.0,608,0.93,48,FemaleDatingStrategy,myousername

lu2bar,Dolly Parton is such a boss,"Watched the Dolly Parton movie on Netflix a few months ago and this song of her's from 1968 was pretty bold, and relevant for this group. Lyrics are below, Youtube of the song. She basically calls out guys for going and sleeping around, ruining a girls reputation, and then claiming a girl sleeping with a man before marriage is worse than a man. She's such a boss.

Even the story behind why she wrote I Will Always Love You, was so that she could get out of her contract on a t.v. show with a guy who was using her and not allowing her to grow her career.

**Just Because I'm a Woman - Dolly Parton**

I can see you're disappointed  
By the way you look at me  
And I'm sorry that I'm not  
The woman you thought I'd be  
Yes, I've made my mistakes  
But listen and understand  
My mistakes are no worse than yours  
Just because I'm a woman

So when you look at me  
Don't feel sorry for yourself  
Just think of all the shame  
You might have brought somebody else

Just let me tell you this  
Then we'll both know where we stand  
My mistakes are no worse than yours  
Just because I'm a woman

Now a man will take a good girl  
And he'll ruin her reputation  
But when he wants to marry  
Well, that's a different situation

He'll just walk off and leave her  
To do the best she can  
While he looks for an angel  
To wear his wedding band

Now I know that I'm no angel  
If that's what you thought you'd found  
I was just the victim of  
A man that let me down

Yes, I've made my mistakes  
But listen and understand  
My mistakes are no worse than yours  
Just because I'm a woman

No, my mistakes are no worse than yours  
Just because I'm a woman",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lu2bar/dolly_parton_is_such_a_boss/,1614476050.0,166,0.97,15,FemaleDatingStrategy,Interesting_Day1188

lu23ht,"Why are strip clubs normalized? Its cheating imo, and you should NEVER go with a partner","My best friend has always been really sexually open and I respect it, but I think sometimes it goes into pick me territory. I was in am LDR and she complained about not seeing my BF ever when he visited, but the first time we had plans she pressured us into going to a strip club with her and her husband so I didnt meet up with them. Looking back its actually annoying that she chose going to a strip club over getting to know him, but whatever.


 I had told her I was not comfortable with going, especially with my SO but I did not press it because I was embarrassed. I had been really brainwashed by sex positivity back then, and I thought if I wasnt comfortable with certain things I was a bad feminist or a prude. So I didnt push the issue with her, I just bailed but I had already told her that a strip club was not my idea of fun. She told me that it wasnt just a strip club, they had hookah and pool tables outside on a patio area. So then my birthday came and I wanted to go to a bar. She brought a random couple and they werent 21 so they couldn't go to the bar, but they could go to the strip club. Her husband and the couple ditched me, my best friend, and another friend of mine and my friend made me feel weird for not wanting to go, so I went, thinking I would just play pool away from the strip club area. It was a terrible experience. It was somehow much... worse than I envisioned and I was SO GLAD I wasnt with my bf. I probably could have been coerced by them to go with him back then, but after experiencing it IRL I will never be back and hope he never goes to one, either.


 I think if we get married (which I really think we will and we discuss often) they will try to rope him into going, but I will not be ok with that. I'm sure they will call me a hypocrite because I went, but my views were MUCH different back then, and I really didn't want to go I am just a bit of a pushover. Also, my boyfriend hates strip clubs, but I know he is going to feel pressured just like I was. I trust him and think he will say no when the time comes, but i do not want to get a barrage of shit when that day comes just because I am firm about this. I dont know why this is normalized and considered a ""tradition"" for bachelor parties, but I dont think I'm crazy for considering it cheating and I'm so tired of being gaslit, particularly by other WOMEN about what I consider cheating. 


A side note: I am bisexual. The friend is not, she just enjoys going for... some reason. I often get my sexuality called into question because I don't sexualize women, which is stupid because I also dont sexualize men. I am a very monogamous person, and I am not sexually attracted to people other than my partner (other than an objective, like oh yeah I can see how that person is cute way). I also dont become sexually attracted without an emotional connection, so body parts of strangers do nothing for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lu23ht/why_are_strip_clubs_normalized_its_cheating_imo/,1614475334.0,294,0.93,38,FemaleDatingStrategy,smolpepper

If you don‚Äôt stand firm in your own standards, morals, beliefs and boundaries, men WILL take advantage of you. 

A relationship takes compromise but DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT compromise on these 4 things. If you‚Äôre with a man who makes you feel like you have to give up one of these 4 things, he‚Äôs not the one. 

If you do this, I promise you everything else will fall into place. 

As discussed multiple times on this sub, men will poke and prod at you to see how much bullshit they can get away with. He‚Äôll make ‚Äújokes‚Äù about anal to test the waters and see if you‚Äôll give in. He‚Äôll ask you out on a walking ‚Äúdate‚Äù to see how little effort he has to put in before you put out. He‚Äôll talk down to you to see how much control he can have over you. 

Stop letting men and pick-me‚Äôs convince you that if you maintain high standards and boundaries you will never find a partner. That‚Äôs the patriarchy talking. Since women have entered the workforce and become self-reliant, men feel like they have lost control over us. Shaming you about your standards is literally their last line of defense to keep you vulnerable.

I quit responding an hour ago and I have 9 messages. He never responded to my response to his question.

I don't care if my male relatives don't bother to acknowledge women as people because then I simply don't bother with them. My female relatives (ones that aren't toxic themselves) receive the full benefit of my love and kindness, and I'm sure most of my male relatives think I'm some kind of man hater because I am single. Their opinions don't matter to me.

I don't exist to perform free emotional labor for men. I don't care who you are.

ltxiye,"Having boundaries does not make you controlling or insecure, and cut anyone out of your life who tells you otherwise.","Warning: long rant.

I see this rhetoric \*constantly\* when a woman enforces a boundary around something that makes her uncomfortable, and it happens especially often in relationships. Men, and often times other women, assume that if a woman has a boundary around a certain action that their partner takes, then she is controlling, jealous, or insecure.  I‚Äôd like to unpack these arguments, because I‚Äôve heard all of them, and it seems to be only getting worse out here for women who dare to have boundaries in relationships.

""Having boundaries is controlling what someone is doing."" Let‚Äôs use porn for an example here. If you tell your partner, ‚ÄúI will not stay in a relationship with you if you use porn/continue to use porn‚Äù, you are controlling YOUR OWN actions by deciding to leave or stay. You are not throwing out your partner‚Äôs porn collection, destroying their laptop or phone, or forcing them to stop at gunpoint. You are letting them make the decision of what they want to do: stay in a relationship with you, or watch porn. THEY are in control of their own actions, not you, and you have not forced them to do anything by having a boundary. I see men claim that this is controlling because it ‚Äúgives them no choice‚Äù but to stop watching porn. No, you do have a choice. The other choice is breaking up, which you don‚Äôt like. Just because you don‚Äôt like the choices doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt have one or someone is forcing you to do something.

""Having boundaries makes you insecure."" This one I see mostly when women have boundaries with their partner consuming porn, whether on sites like PH, subscribing to Onlyfans, or watching pornographic videos on reddit. However, I also see women being accused of this when they have boundaries around their partner going to strip clubs, liking or viewing half-naked photos of other women on social media, ogling women in public, or talking about how hot they find other women or who they‚Äôd want to sleep with.  I‚Äôve genuinely never understood the connection between a woman wanting her partner to focus their sexual energy and attention solely on her and insecurity.

If you are in a completely monogamous relationship and have established this, the obvious conclusion that most people draw is that you‚Äôre not going to have sex with other people, because that would be considered betraying your partner. So how is it different to watch women you want to have sex with, imagine yourself having sex with other women, having women touch you or speak to you in a sexual way, or paying for sexual services from other women who are not your partner? Having a problem with this is not feeling that you are not good enough, its the fact that your partner is giving the sexual attention to multiple other women that he promised to give to you by committing to a monogamous relationship.  I‚Äôm sure its true that some women may struggle with insecurities and also not want their partner to watch porn, but I do not think one always equals the other.  I‚Äôm sick to death of confident, beautiful, secure, smart, kind women having the ‚ÄúINSECURE‚Äù label slapped on them when they have a boundary. Expecting your partner to not want to fuck every woman who isn‚Äôt you is not insecurity, and most likely has nothing to do with how a woman views herself.

It took me years to develop strong boundaries and leave at the first sign of disrespect or anything that I felt uncomfortable with, a lot of the reason being that I felt I was not allowed to. The whole ‚Äúyou have to respect and accept the fact that you partner watches porn‚Äù mentality is plastered all over social media, especially on reddit, and shoves down women‚Äôs throats that they aren‚Äôt allowed to decide what boundaries they have.  From ‚Äúsex therapists‚Äù and relationship gurus on Instagram, to pickme women bragging about how superior and not crazy they are for letting their partner get off to other women, there is virtually no support for women who have valid boundaries regarding porn or otherwise.  ANY boundary you have is fine, and you do not have to explain yourself to anyone or let anyone tell you otherwise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ltxiye/having_boundaries_does_not_make_you_controlling/,1614460582.0,362,0.97,33,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

ltj1ur,LVMs in the workplace,"Hey all, something I've been thinking lately is LVMs can have negative impact even when you're not near them in a romantic capacity. You gotta watch for it because they can cause just as much trouble as a horrid boyfriend, if not more.

I had an awful experience straight out of college at my first job where my male boss told me that the job takes talent and maybe I should consider doing something I'm actually good at (after me pulling 60h weeks and hitting every unrealistic deadline). This broke me for months and made me doubt myself.

For context, I was top of my class from a prestigious STEM uni, the boss wasn't, he was just older, so of course he knew how to do certain things that I didn't yet. I went on to work on multiple projects and another firm since, and have been quite successful, but I still think about that incident. I was the only woman on that team (which had about 10 people on it). 

He frequently spoke over me in meetings and once screamed at me in a conference room alone. I didn't realize it was textbook workplace harassment and that I could speak up when it happened. 

I spoke up two years later to another male superior since it still bothered me so much, and he completely shot it down and told me my previous boss was a very nice guy and I shouldn't judge a person just because they were ""mean"". It was the biggest catalyst for my job change, and the difference in how I'm treated at work is day and night. 

Carry over the FDS mindset to work and always keep your self respect high. üëë",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ltj1ur/lvms_in_the_workplace/,1614411386.0,243,0.95,19,FemaleDatingStrategy,haunted_vcr

lthmil,Age related fertility decline is a gaslight lie used against women. Health &amp; sperm count is what matters.,"Decline in fertility is blamed/gaslighted on women by society. A common trope:   due to  delay in age at which women have  children.  **But that has not actually been proven by science**, because women's reproduction has not been well studied at all!    *While there may be correlation with age but* ***anyone claiming  age=causality is a liar****.*    Decline in fertility has more to do with (a)  health and (b) sperm count.

After analyzing 185 studies involving nearly 45,000 healthy men, Swan and her team found that **over the past four decades, sperm counts among men in Western countries had dropped by more than 50%.**

***We showed that the problems in young women were actually higher than those in older ones. So, I don‚Äôt buy that the decline in fertility is solely due to delayed childbearing.***

**You mentioned the effect of these chemicals on male fertility, but what about women‚Äôs fertility?**

That‚Äôs harder to study. Most of my work on specific hormonally active agents has been on men. Men are much better studied because, traditionally, men have always been better studied. **Until recently, the National Institutes of Health didn‚Äôt even require you to study both sexes.** Secondly, in men, it‚Äôs very easy to look at the organs and sperm. It‚Äôs harder to examine a woman‚Äôs eggs and her ovaries. You have to have an ultrasound to do that. So, women are harder to study for many reasons.

ltfiun,Learning to Allow Yourself Be Treated Well,"Pre FDS, I used to be the woman who wanted to impress guys with how cool, how chill, and how independent and how modern I was. I had adopted many libfem qualities like asking guys out, offering to pay, driving to him, asking to define the relationship or saying I love you first, etc (*vomits*). As you grow solid in FDS you may find that you have to unlearn your old libfem habits and literally learn to be comfortable with HVM treating you well.

Case in point : I‚Äôm currently dating and vetting a few men. One man in particular is showing signs of potentially being a HVM.  He drives an hour each way to meet me in my city. He always pays. Always. And he smiles when I politely thank him for dinner like it‚Äôs his absolute pleasure.  I sometimes catch myself wanting to tell him ‚Äúno, you always pay, let me get treat you this time‚Äù ‚Äúthis is too expensive I‚Äôll split‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive to you.‚Äù And then I repeat to myself:

RELAX. HE WANTS TO DO THIS. HE ENJOYS THIS. IT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE A MAN. ITS OKAY TO BE TREATED WELL! 

Male lurkers will read this and think this is selfish and one sided. Nope. I show and tell him I appreciate his gestures with smiles, and squeeze his hand and kiss his cheek and other small, non monetary tokens of gratitude.  But I NEVER step into his role and become the pursuer. I never let him think he‚Äôs choosing me instead of the other way around. 

TLDR: Reformed libfem ladies- ALLOW yourself be pursued by HVM. Don‚Äôt get scared and regress back to the 50/50 girl hoping to impress him with your coolness. It‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôve been conditioned to chase all of your life but learn to RELAX and receive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ltfiun/learning_to_allow_yourself_be_treated_well/,1614397683.0,478,0.98,24,FemaleDatingStrategy,coloneldjmustard

ltc8bd,"How is it that, in an age of supposed ""dating equality,"" women still get the short straw?","Let's consider what dating today looks like.

**We can make our own money now!** But it's still typically less than men's. And making more money than your partner will often emasculate him. And you're still expected to split costs 50/50 OR repay the man for dates with sex. Oh, and you should contribute more when your partner is struggling financially and/or unemployed because that's what a partnership is. What's that? You want him to do the same for you? Don't be a gold digger, you can make your own money now!

Prenups are good now if they favor men, because that's his money and you didn't earn it. Neither did your kids. But if you have money squirreled away that your partner doesn't know about/have access to, that's manipulation!

Oh, do you have kids? You'll be taking on the bulk of the parenting duties AND working a full-time job, AND keeping up with the housework. Your husband worked a whole 40 hours this week, he needs to relax.

Wait, are you NOT making your own money right now! GOLD DIGGER! GOLD DIGGER!

**We can choose our partners now!** But you should still give that one guy a chance, because he's nice and he really likes you. You have to make sure you choose the right man, because you'll be blamed if he abuses you. Should've gone for personality instead, you shallow harpy!

Also, be advised that *not* choosing a partner is the wrong choice. You must strive to be picked at all times, and show no standards so that he's happy to have you around. If you have any standards at all? Well, this is why y'all are single.

**We can choose to have sex (or not) now!** But the standards for sex have changed. You should be more ""open minded"" and ""sex positive"" else you're a prude and, well, this is why y'all are single. Try anal! Try threesomes! Try face-fucking! Then try it again, because even though you hated it all, your boyfriend loved them, so either you did something wrong or you need to just get used to it. You want pleasure? Give your boyfriend a map and direct him every step of the way. Direct him to stay on the map when he gets bored. And eventually give up, because your orgasm just isn't happening tonight and he's begging you to touch his dick again. Get used to your man looking at more porn than ever, because it's perfectly healthy and men need variety anyway. It's perfectly normal that he interacts daily with Instagram models, OnlyFans girls, and camgirls while giving you less attention. Maybe if you were more enthusiastic in bed, he wouldn't need them.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. There's no relationship yet. Why do you need labels to have sex? In fact, your sexual performance outside of a relationship will communicate your worthiness as a potential partner. Look at it like an audition!

Don't want to play this game? No problem. There are plenty of other women who will. Have fun being single!

DO want to play this game? Congratulations, you're now demoted to ""hookup material"" and no longer eligible for husband benefits. 

\---

In short:

We can make our own money! (But you'd better give it to men)

We can choose our partners! (But you'd better be charitable)

We can choose to have sex! (But you better choose to have all of it)

It seems we have more options in dating than before, but the ""acceptable"" choices are still defined by men.

\---

Meanwhile, what changes do men put up with?

If women are making money and paying 50/50, that means they're putting less money into dates. Dating is now cheaper for them.

Women are more sexually open than before, which means they're having more sex.

Women are more likely to choose to date ""nice guys"" with personalities, which means men's dating pool is wider than in the past even if they're broke and ugly. That is, until they themselves fuck it up and drive the women away by not being the ""nice guys"" they claim to be.

Yes, there is a growing subset of women with higher standards. (Where could they be, I wonder?) This would mean men have the expectation to show up, groom themselves, not fuck everything in sight, and be decent humans. How awful! I can see now why the good old days were so good.

ltc07c,Write a list of all the reasons why your ex is awful,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is kind of redundant, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard it before. But it really helps. I was in an abusive relationship over four years ago. 2 years after that I finally decided to get therapy, and one of the first things my therapist suggested to do was compile a list of all the reasons why I‚Äôm better off without him. And let me tell you, this list is loooong. It helped me at first, I looked at it from time to time,  but this was over two years ago and I have done a lot of healing since then, and mostly forgot about this list until today. It‚Äôs rare now but I still get triggered every once in a while and have panic attacks/suicidal thoughts. Today was especially bad. I think I heard some story about someone cheating or something and I was reminded about him cheating on me and then discarding me for the other woman while showing no remorse. In the middle of being upset and reliving the situation, I asked myself why am I still so upset about it?   

He was a horrible person and I should be glad he left. Of course I know he was a horrible person, but it‚Äôs been so long. Sometimes I forget why. I decided to look at the list again, I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I looked at it but I know its been well over a year. 

I was suddenly reminded of all the gaslighting, lies, double standards, and overall awfulness of the whole relationship. My panic and despair immediately disappeared. Like holy shit... why am I crying again? If I could I would give the affair partner an award for taking him off my hands. Good riddance. 

So yea, back to my original point. If you feel like you‚Äôre having a difficult time getting over your LVM ex and havent done so already, make this list. You may find yourself needing it years from now. PTSD from a relationship with an LVM is no joke and can have lingering effects for a long time. Please take care of yourselves out there ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Ps. Also make a different list of all the good things you want in a HVM. All the opposite traits of the LVM ex, and never stray from the things in this list when dating new people. Dump him at the first sign of even the most minuscule red flag. After all the bull shit and abuse we‚Äôve been through, we deserve all the things that we want and all the things that we know will make us happy. TAKE NO SHIT.

lt4wed,MENTAL CLARITY ACHIEVED. THE BIG FOG HAS BEEN LIFTED! Also I have an idea for you to try ‚Äî If you haven‚Äôt already!,"I just want to share‚Ä¶ Over the past of how many years I can‚Äôt remember, I‚Äôve always been living in a hazy cloud of self doubt, grief, sadness, shame‚Ä¶ For the first time in my life, today I feel relieved!! It‚Äôs like standing on top of a skyscraper. The view is clear, the sun is glorious and the air is fresh. For the first time in my life, I can breath.

**Some back story about me:**

I grew up in Asia, the experience of which, as a woman, is a trauma in itself. My family is also extremely traditionally minded, the most extreme end of the right, the kind of family that explicitly looks down on and abuses women and girls. My mother was forced to go through multiple childbirth traumas (miscarriages, abortions, multiple births in a row, you name it) to try to conceive a son because inherently baby girls are worthless to them.

I then got involved in a terrible relationshit that lasted 10+ years resulting in me plunging down the deep end of my depression. My self worth was absolutely annihilated and despite my career was reaching a peak--with a lot of resistance coming from my ex of course!and I became a somewhat famous for what I did in my country, I ALWAYS felt like I was WORTHLESS, EITHER FAKING IT or I WAS ‚ÄúJUST LUCKY‚Äù - according to him. As a result, I felt very lost, eventually became suicidal but somehow I chose to live and started to break away from him.

**How I am now:**

SINCE DISCOVERING FDS about 7 months ago, I‚Äôve gradually transitioned into getting my mind &amp; soul together, getting some clarity about how I ACTUALLY feel and think. I've also learned with the help of therapy that I AM ABSOLUTELY RIGHT &amp; I AM  ALLOWED to feel and thing those things after what happened to me.

Now if you think the breaking away part is hard, the period followed that is much more terrible (but totally worth it, don‚Äôt worry!!) It‚Äôs terrible because although I removed the central source of my miseries, I am left to struggle with the flashbacks of the abuse, and ESPECIALLY the sense that I am to be blamed for it all, that I should know my place, that I wasn‚Äôt good enough.

And I can‚Äôt understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

**UNTIL RECENTLY,** an idea popped into my mind. I decided to DELIBERATELY c**ut all male contacts for 24 - 48 hours.** No male friends online or offline, no male colleagues, no OLD, and of course I don‚Äôt respond to my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

AND THEN WOW today happened. When I woke up today, a profound sense of relief, freedom &amp; peace washed over me. What I didn‚Äôt realize is that the presence of MALES in general **HAS BEEN BAD** for me. When I talked to them, it was always about them and their problems, and if it was an acquaintance without knowing I was usually forced to play the ‚Äútherapist‚Äù or the ‚Äúpixie dream girl‚Äù that entertained and motivated them. The OLD guys also pissed me off and I was often left angry because of their glaring entitlement. Also side-note, I constantly felt like those apps are exploiting us in some way?? (anyone else feels that way??)

&amp;#x200B;

THAT BEING SAID,

**Here‚Äôs an idea for you ladies. Let‚Äôs experiment this. In the next 24 hours, renounce ALL male personal access to you. That includes relatives, old friends, acquaintances, and, ahem, especially ONLINE DATING.**

These people have no idea that having access to you, your wisdom, humor, charm, TIME is a privilege and it‚Äôs very like they‚Äôre misusing it. The patriarchy has convinced us to give our time &amp; attention for free for these guys.

If you want to experience a little bit of what it means to feel better, pleaseee consider trying it.  IF you‚Äôre afraid of walking away from it all FOR GOOD like me (I really wish I could do that but I'm working on it) try it out for 24 - 48 hours. I hope I don't sound preachy but you‚Äôll KNOW what I‚Äôm talking about!!!

lt48mh,"""Choking my girlfriend isn't abusive because she asks for it"" has the same energy as ""well if you're really being abused, why don't you just leave?""","Both involve shifting the blame from the abuser onto the victim. I'm tired of misogynists trying to make women responsible for the fact that men like to hurt us.

By focusing on ""individual choice"" we ignore all of the other factors such as systemic oppression. By focusing solely on the individual we are making oppressed people responsible for their own oppression (because it was their ""choice""!), and drawing the attention away from their oppressors. 

People engage in self destructive behaviors all the time. Just because someone ""chooses"" to do something doesn't mean it is morally correct. It would be like saying ""stabbing people is wrong"" and then someone from the Pro-Stabbing Lobby gaslighting you like ""well what about people who cut themselves? What about people who WANT to get stabbed because they ENJOY bleeding? You wouldn't want to take away their freedom to consent now, would you?""

When we see someone who is suicidal, or someone who struggles with anorexia, drug addiction, or any other illnesses that involve self harm. We don't go ""her body, her choice"", we correctly identify that this person is ill and that they need help.

When I was younger I used to be into ""kink"" but those sexual preferences melted away when I went to therapy and healed my childhood trauma. Nowadays it's literally impossible for me to feel sexually aroused at the thought of pain and degradation. It disgusts me. 

I used to justify my ""kinks"" with all kinds of mental gymnastics in an attempt to shield myself from the mental anguish of facing up to my past trauma. The reality is that I was mentally ill and needed help. Whenever I see a woman viciously defending her ""kinky"" lifestyle, I wonder if she is going through the same. Saying whatever she needs to say to herself to avoid having to feel unwanted psychological pain. 

All women are oppressed under patriarchy. All women have trauma from being raised in a misogynistic society that conditions women to tolerate and even enjoy being abused. It's not fun or exciting, it's just sad.

It's disgusting to me that there are men out there who take advantage of traumatized women. Men who get off on hurting women and causing them even more trauma. It is literally EVIL.

Whenever I see a man proudly boast about his ""dom"" status, he is immediately clockable as an abusive piece of shit. It's irrelevant to me if his partner says they enjoy it. The fact of the matter is that here is a man who literally orgasms at the thought of hurting people.

I immediately called my HVM at work saying I was in an accident. I didn't ask him to show up but he dropped everything at work, grabbed some tools (mechanic) and rushed to me to make sure I was okay and if the car was able to be driven. He stayed there while I talked to the police. Made sure I was heard and if I was confused about something (never filed a claim before) KINDLY said he would walk me through it later. There was no talking down to me, no criticizing how I should of been able to avoid this dumbass hitting me etc. Then after he got off work, he took me out to eat to distract me from the stress of the day. He genuinely cared about me and was there for me.

lt0fif,HVM will be CONFUSED when you thank them for their basic decency,"Inspired by a recent post and my own man, it suddenly occurred to me: a HVM will be CONFUSED when you thank him for doing basic, thoughtful, kind things.

When my husband takes me out for dinner/surprises me with little gifts/takes care of ""my"" chores around the house without mentioning it, he gets genuinely surprised when I'm grateful. Good men KNOW these are BARE MINIMUM (or maybe very slightly better than bare minimum) behaviours. They have not been trained since birth to expect D- treatment, so when they come to you with B+ actions they will be confused at how impressed you are.

I'm not saying that you can't appreciate the little acts of kindness and thoughtful gestures from your man. You certainly can, and I do. But watch how your man reacts when you thank him for the basics.

If you cook and he gets up immediately to do the dishes, what happens if you thank him? Does he look at you oddly and say something like ""uhhh...yeah? Of course? You cooked?"" or does he expect a goddamn parade? And if you ""forget"" to thank him, does he pout, grumble, or withhold affection? Or does he not even notice, because it's not big deal?

A good man knows that decent is, and he doesn't expect praise for it. If he does something a little extra (surprises you with flowers, brings you a cup of tea while you work) does he think you should fall down at his feet in amazement and gratitude? Or does he do these things consistently, not because he's expecting praise, but because to him these are OBVIOUS, BASIC THINGS that you would do for someone you love??

If you're used to guys who acted like you should be taking out a billboard to adequately thank them for every speck of consideration, it will take a while to get used to a man who is consistently nice to you and thinks nothing of it. Obviously if he whisks you away to Paris as a surprise anniversary trip, sure, give him the thanks he has earned. But if he vacuums without being asked? If he fills up your gas tank and brings you home your favourite fancy coffee? That's basic stuff, and a good man KNOWS IT.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lt0fif/hvm_will_be_confused_when_you_thank_them_for/,1614354533.0,682,0.97,38,FemaleDatingStrategy,masterofthebarkarts

lstt9c,Jane Austen knew this stuff long before Sherry Argov did,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this thread (I can't tell you how life-changing it's been) so I hope I'm not breaking any unspoken etiquette by posting. I just wanted to share an observation I made when I was thinking (obsessing) about all this stuff again yesterday.

The FDS approach to dating/love can be applied to every one of Jane Austen's stories. It fits perfectly. And she was writing over 200 years ago.

Take Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most popular book. Lizzie Bennett is undoubtedly a high value woman. She is from a relatively poor family, and she lacks many of the accomplishments that men (and other women) of the time judged women of her age by. She cheerfully admits that she is skilled at neither music nor painting nor embroidery, and her family connections are not high society ones. But all the same, she knows her own worth. It doesn't matter that she doesn't measure up to societal standards for women, because she measures up to her own. She has a quick wit and a keen sense of honour, she reads voraciously, and she has a warm and affectionate heart for anyone deserving of it. 

Neither does she suffer fools (scrotes) lightly. In the early scenes with Mr. Collins (AKA Scrote Supreme) she is the EPITOME of the Dumb Fox. She roasts the rude, patronising little man; right to his face! And she manages that without ever being the slightest bit impolite or indiscreet. Then, speaking of knowing her own worth, she refuses to bow to the INTENSE financial and familial pressure put on her to marry him (he will inherit her family home once her ageing father is dead.) It's worth taking a minute to really appreciate the magnitude of this. The man could turn her and all her other female family members out into the street just a few years from now, but she still finds the strength to say no. Some people have called her selfish for this (because of course they have üôÑ) but they're wrong - she's strong. She understands that a match with Collins would be physically and intellectually degrading for her, that it would destroy her life and wellbeing even if it saved her and her family from financial ruin. So what does she do, ladies? She refuses to be a martyr. She refuses to believe that her mother and society know better than what she knows, viscerally, in her bones. She rejects him.

And where does Darcy fit into all of this, you may ask - doesn't he famously insult Lizzie the very first time they meet?? (Not to her face, but still.) If Jane Austen is a FDS-er, why oh WHY would she pair off her heroine with someone exhibiting such NVM behaviour? The answer is that Darcy is not an NVM - not at the beginning, and certainly not by the end. As Darcy puts it himself, ""I was given good principles but  left to follow them in arrogance and conceit."" At the beginning of the story he is admittedly pretty low value - he is self-indulgent and overly proud and he allows his shyness to make him appear rude. By the end of the story, he is a HVM.

Now, crucially, Lizzie does NOT fix Darcy. This is important. If she had, then P+P would just be another pickme story about a """"misunderstood"""" man being given a load of emotional and mental energy by a nice woman that he absolutely does not deserve. When Darcy first begins to pursue Lizzie, he does it so clumsily that she doesn't even notice. When he first proposes, she knocks him back with the fury that such barefaced audacity deserves. And then she goes her own way. She gets on with her life. It's only by chance that they are thrown back together, and in the meantime Darcy has been working tirelessly on his flaws. The rest of the book is about Darcy proving to himself (and consequently to Lizzie) that he will never allow laziness or self-indulgence to rule his behaviour again. He is kind and considerate to her relatives (even the ones he has no real respect for), and he no longer tolerates disrespect towards her from anyone in his social circle. He secures two of her sisters' marriages and the continuing respectability of her family, by facing up to Wickham (the NVM who was once his best friend) and he lays out the modern equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it. All in the belief that Lizzie will never find out that he was responsible for saving her family from ruin, and for no other reason than that he wants her to be safe and happy.

When he finally proposes again he does so with no expectations or sense of entitlement for anything he's done - he makes it clear that if his attentions are unwelcome then they will stop immediately, but that equally he will do anything he can to earn her trust. That's why it's an enduring love story - not because of the pretty lace ribbons or regency era aesthetic. It's about a woman who refuses to settle, either for a relationship where her partner doesn't respect her, or for one where she cannot respect her partner.

TL;DR - the idea that Darcy is some brooding, irresistible anti-hero is, frankly, LAUGHABLE, and Jane Austen would be turning in her grave at the lessons that some modern Pickmeishas take from her book. It's not a story about overlooking a man's flaws in case there's a better, more respectful one inside, it's a story about a woman who values herself enough to reject any man who doesn't respect her for who she is.

P.S. similar lessons can be derived from her other books, particularly Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion, my own personal favourite. (Ignore what they did to it in the 2008 adaptation, where they made the heroine literally chase the hero through the streets of Bath, tears and snot running down her face. AUSTEN WOULD NEVER.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lstt9c/jane_austen_knew_this_stuff_long_before_sherry/,1614330379.0,293,0.96,28,FemaleDatingStrategy,Neoprude
lst67g,I'm relapsing into pickmedom.,"I know this is stupid and I should know already. My brain is tricking me again.

This man never put effort into meeting my friends, dates, etc. He even behaved rude in front of my parents. He was dismissive of my interests that weren't similar to his own. He made fun of me in front of people sometimes and he thought I was after his money even thought we did 50/50 most of the time. He said 'women are lazy' and other misogynistic jokes a few times. He seemed to lack empathy while he was in a relationship with me. I was a pickme before so I didn't realize how bad this was.

He already found someone else that is into the same things as he is. I'm guessing he will treat her 10 times better.

But will he do that? Can someone that treated his ex gfs with so little effort be HVM for a woman that is more compatible with him? Would a HVM treat women that are pickmes like this?

lspv2b,I took it all.,"My boyfriend and I broke up a few months ago, but there have been complications with the apartment because we are both on the lease, and blah blah blah. But I found a new place to live and moved out last weekend. I got the important stuff out, but there were still a few small boxes left and I didn‚Äôt go through the kitchen because I didn‚Äôt know what my new roommate had. My ex helped me move, and everything was going very well and we were being cordial. 

Well, last night, my ex asked me to come over to pick up a few of the small boxes that were in the closet, and to say hi to his dog who was sad that I was gone. So I go over there; we are hanging out. I play with his dog. Everything is good. Then I asked him if he minded if I took the dish brush because my new house didn‚Äôt have one. I asked because I bought this dish brush just a couple weeks ago, and I even splurged on a nicer one (like $5 lol). 

Side note: I am the only person in our relationship who ever bought household items like this. I just moved into a new place where the rent is higher. I‚Äôve had to pay for a moving truck, and all the other little things associated with moving somewhere new. The last thing I want to do is go to the store and drop another $50 or so buying a bunch of little things I literally just bought a couple weeks ago. 

Apparently asking for the dish brush triggered him, and he made the ridiculous dictate (at 8 pm on Wednesday, mind you) that I could take anything I that‚Äôs mine TONIGHT, but anything that was there when I left THAT NIGHT would be his property now. 

I, annoyed, said no, that I don‚Äôt agree to this. I immediately said the dish brush was not a big deal. I told him that I did not come prepared (with boxes, bags, etc) to get everything I wanted from the kitchen.  I said I could do this tomorrow or any other day of his choosing. I begged him to compromise. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt take the dish brush or anything that he said he wanted. However, he only tripled down, and refused to budge from his ridiculous demand. 

So I became very irate. I told him that if he was going to make me move all my dishes out in plastic trash bags tonight, that I was going to take every last thing that was mine. Again, I am the only person who ever bought anything like pots, spices, utensils, cleaning supplies, etc. I was planning on leaving most of it with him because my new roommate already has a lot of this stuff, but I decided that if he was going to make such a ridiculous rule, then I would take it all. I took the dish brush, the sponges (used and unused), all my spices, the soap, the utensils, all the pots, the Tupperware, the toothpicks, the toilet paper, the pillows, the wall hooks, the coat hangers...I even took the light bulbs. I took it ALL! 

Did I yell? Yes. Was I petty? Absolutely. But I think it is quite petty to make a demand on the spot, that everything I don‚Äôt take tonight becomes his when this was not the pretense under which I came over, and I was obviously not prepared.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lspv2b/i_took_it_all/,1614313736.0,1261,0.95,81,FemaleDatingStrategy,janethebrain1298

lsp0ft,"If he walks faster than you in public, DUMP HIM","Has anyone else noticed this about straight couples?

It pisses me off whenever I see a man speedwalking with his wife or girlfriend, forcing her to lowkey sprint just to keep up with him. Or worse, he leaves her in the dust without even turning his head to see if she's still with him.

When a man does this to his wife or girlfriend it means he doesn't give a shit about her.

Speaking from personal experience, when a man truly loves and cares about a woman, he will be considerate of her walking pace and will slow down to a speed that is comfortable for her. He will turn his head from time to time to check in with her and make sure she's still walking next to him.

Anytime I've ever called a guy out for walking way faster than me, he goes ""i cAnT HeLp iT cUz iM TaLLeR tHaN u"" which is bullshit because one of the HVMs I dated was 6'5"" and he had no issues with slowing down to accommodate the people he was with, because he was a *thoughtful and considerate person.*

For those of you who are in relationships with men who do this, you might be thinking to yourself ""wow what a stupid reason to break up with someone"" and that him walking faster than you is not that big of a deal.

Here's the thing though: if he's like that with you now, he will continue to be like that in the future, even if you are pregnant, injured, or carrying a baby.

My parents used to tell me all the time what it was like going out in public together when I was a baby. My dad would park the car and immediately walk into the store or restaurant without even checking on my mom. She got left behind having to deal with unbuckling me from the car seat, and then he would get frustrated with her for taking so long. He did this when she was pregnant too, by the way. Just... speedwalking ahead while she waddles 20 feet behind him, 8 months pregnant. 

My mom used to ""joke"" that she couldn't let him take me anywhere alone because apparently there were a couple times where he ""forgot"" me in the back seat of the car and she couldn't trust him not to let me die from being cooked alive in a hot car.

The sort of man who does this is communicating that he is selfish and inconsiderate. When someone tells you who they are, *believe them.*

Edit: Holy shit why are men SO TRIGGERED by this post? I'm laughing so hard at the pretty clear gender divide in the comments and my inbox. Women are like *""YES this is so relatable! My ex always walked faster than me and he turned out to be extremely abusive! Wish I saw this 5 years ago, would have saved me a lot of trauma!""* Meanwhile the triggered scrotes are outing themselves as abusers by getting defensive like *""NUH UH, this is the dumbest post I've ever seen, why not jUsT cOmMuNiCaTe? U bitches gonna be single forever if u break up with men over every tiny thing!""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lsp0ft/if_he_walks_faster_than_you_in_public_dump_him/,1614310780.0,1842,0.74,326,FemaleDatingStrategy,myousername

lsowut,Please tell me I made a right decision to leave my ex.,"I left him yesterday. We were in a ldr.
Last June was the last time we saw each other.



4-5 months ago he met a girl on discord and they spent lots of time together. She lives in a different country in Europe. They watch films, play games, talk on the phone for hours together(on discord. Never met in person)


He said she brings her happiness and she supports him and she is a very good friend. She knows that he has a gf and they are just 100% friends. 



Ok. I tried to understand.



He had IG account. He used to follow only me but one day he unfollowed me.
I asked him why and he said he doesn't use IG and that's why he unfollowed me.
I asked him to follow me because it's not a big deal and you don't even use it. What's the matter? 
He said he just doesn't want to and IG is all about marketing and stuff. Gave me all the reasons not to follow and later he said he deleted the app(not the account tho).


I was still following his account. Because why not? He'e my bf.
And one day I clicked his account and he was following this girl he met on discord.
I got upset and asked what happened.
He said he was doing screenshare with her and he saw her ig account and followed her to surprise her.
He gave me so many reasons not to follow my account but then he followed her just to surprise her for fun? 
I got upset and he didn't understand why.



I wanted to send him gifts and stuff. I wanted him to do the same.
He lives in Europe and I live in Asia.
He said he doesn't think it's right time to send packages to each other due to covid. I didn't understand why it is related but okay.


Yesterday, he sent me a picture of him in a blacket hoodie. He said the discord girl sent her for new year's surprise gift. 
I asked how come she knows your address.
He said he did google maps and showed her and other discord friends where he lives.
I asked if he also sent something to her.
He said a card.
I asked just a card?
He said, oh right I also sent her some chocolate my mom bought because I wanted to get rid of them.


This was the last straw for me.


When I told him that once he said he doesn't think it's right to send packages due to covid, he said he didn't send it because the shipping cost is more to send a package to asia. 
And our relationship hasn't been very stable and that's why he didn't want to celebrate anything.
I said this is emotional cheating.


I had 2 valentine's day while I was dating him. 
Did I get anything? No.
I had 1 birthday while I was dating him.
I got a steam game for birthday gift from him.
Did I get christmas or ny gift?
Not even a card.
Did I get a anniversary gift?
Do you think I did?

lsmpm1,Communication IS NOT key,"I read a lot of psychology books and I came across this psychologist and his works in one of them recently. It basically confirms what people have been saying on here about how communication is not key for a good relationship, and the criticism of the ability or responsibility to communicate often falls on the woman (think ‚ÄújUsT cOmMuNiCaTe‚Äù comments in other relationship subs). 

Dr John Gottman wrote a book after spending a 14 year period observing over 650 straight couples. He also observed many LGBTQ+ couples as well with similar findings. 

Gottman notes that most marriages fail after seeking couples therapy, because of the common advice from therapists which is usually to simply ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù to one another. 

‚ÄúUnder the heading, ‚Äòwhy most marriage therapy fails‚Äô Gottman reveals the biggest myth of professional councilling: that communication between partners is the key to a happy, lasting marriage.‚Äù 

He notes that communicating grievances can work for short periods of time, but eventually couples will fall back into the same problems within a year, and will resent each other increasingly. 

The idea of ‚Äúcommunicating‚Äù to solve problems with a partner originated from the psychologist, Carl Rogers, who claimed that non-judgemental listening and acceptance of another persons feelings creates rapport.  

Gottman‚Äôs other research found that most arguments between couples were caused by majorly differing opinions;

E.g) You want kids and marriage but your partner doesn‚Äôt. 

Your partner watches porn but you think it is wrong. 

Your partner flirts with other women in front of you and you hate that. 

Gottman claims the key to a good relationship is friendship. Mutual respect, fondness and admiration are counters to the disgust and resentment one can feel toward a partner. He claims everyday acts of kindness and daily attentions are what make a marriage strong. 

I think the take away from his work is that communication is useless in solving conflict if the problem is bigger than the argument itself. 
I see this a lot with friends who date someone completely different to them in terms of politics, interests, beliefs; and they claim them as their ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù but are baffled by all the arguing and suffering they endure. They commit themselves to endless communicating that goes nowhere and then they begin to resent each other. 

Date people who share the same important opinions as you, and want the same things as you. This isn‚Äôt to say you can‚Äôt date someone who has differing music taste or doesn‚Äôt like the beach, but dating someone with different fundamental beliefs to yours is going to cause you a lot of heartache that isn‚Äôt going to be solved with communication. 

Remember this next time someone tells you to communicate with your partner. It‚Äôs poor advice that ignores the reality that you might just be incompatible or unable to maintain the deep friendship and respect that a good marriage requires. 

Gottmans research supports FDS‚Äô ‚Äúthank u next‚Äù mindset, that discourages women from staying with someone out of fear or comfort and wasting immense amounts of time and energy trying to communicate with someone incompatible with us, for the sake of it. It encourages you to find someone who aligns with your deepest beliefs and standards, and build a relationship based on respect and understanding that doesn‚Äôt require constant communicating.

lslssh,My boyfriend massages my hands in the morning,"Recently, I had a rheumatoid arthritis scare. My mom has RA and Sjogren's, both autoimmune diseases that she has lived with since she was in her early 30s. I'm in my mid 20s, and noticed that my hands, especially my metacarpals, proximal interphalangeal joints, and wrists were bilaterally stiff and painful every morning waking up. Very typical presentation of RA. Every morning, my boyfriend would massage my wrists and hands. Sometimes, if he forgot, I would just put my hands on his chest and he would instinctively start to massage my hands. Of course, the pain isn't every day - it's unpredictable when the pain comes and goes, but in recent months it has been super regular.

I recently went to my mom's rheumatologist to get some blood drawn for autoimmune markers to see if I was anti-CCP or anti-Ro/La positive. All of my blood tests came back normal, and I was super relieved, but I started to feel really bad and guilty that my boyfriend had been massaging my hands even though my blood tests were negative. I was scared he was going to call me a liar or insinuate that I had been wasting his time. In my previous relationship, my ex's default was to assume to that I was lying about my pain, or discount my pain altogether. I told my boyfriend that the blood tests were negative, so it was weird that I was having symptoms, and that I was sorry that he had been massaging my hands in the morning and that I felt like a burden.

This man looked so confused, and said ""You can be seronegative and still have symptoms"". He also said that he would continue to massage my hands regardless of what a blood test said, so long as I had pain or stiffness. He then asked how he could improve his technique.

lsjc17,Why ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs consensual‚Äù is a shitty argument for BDSM/abuse kink,"(Tw: mentions of self harm/abuse) 
Simply: many people who are survivors of sexual abuse use abuse kink/physical ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù abuse, and BDSM to ‚Äúcope‚Äù with their past trauma (I have also done this, back in my libretto days). Many people who survive sexual abuse also sometimes self harm. People who are survivors who self harm often do it to punish themselves, cope with the mental pain etc. If someone came to you, and said they were self harming, you would tell them to seek professional help. But for some reason, if that harm is coming from another person (ie knifeplay, asphyxiation, beating, consensual non consent etc) it‚Äôs ok? It‚Äôs still self harm, and an unhealthy coping mechanism, but because it benefits men‚Äôs erections and sexual perversions, being against it is ‚Äúkink shaming.‚Äù Sorry but telling a guy to cut and beat you is no different from cutting and beating yourself, idc if you think its ‚Äúpleasurable‚Äù, idc if you smack ‚Äúkink‚Äù on top. 
If I consensually told my husband to shoot me or cannibalize me, he would still go to jail if he did so.

2. Says the word ""based"" a lot when someone states an opinion or something they think is a good idea. An example: Trump says something they agree with, they will say ""based"". They will use ""based"" in other contexts as well and it is a big one to look out for. 
3. Posts images of pepe/wojak. Uses the names ""stacy/chad/becky/brad/tyrone"" to describe people. Uses the word ""tradwife"", ""peak fertility"". Common insults are ""brainlet"", ""manlet"", ""glowpeople"", ""glow"" before a word, ""jogger"", ""cuck"", ""jannies"", and using double parentheses such as """"word"""".

lschos,"Language and euphemisms, be wise to it - All ""sex work"" is prostitution. ""Breath play"" is strangulation. ""FWB"" is giving a man boyfriend access with no reciprocation required on his part.","There are people in this world who make fortunes branding ideas in ways that make them seem more attractive and palatable to the general public. In fact there are entire companies and political strategy firms dedicated to doing only this. Sometimes they call it messaging, another name for this is propaganda. It's big business.

Take for example The Patriot Act which was passed in the US post 9/11. Sounds good right? Who doesn't want to support our troops and keep the country safe from terrorists. Most people, including politicians do not read bills that run thousands of pages long. This allowed them to include things in the bill that actually took away many freedoms Americans once enjoyed all under the guise of patriotism. Now, whether you agree with the contents of the bill or not the fact is that the name of the bill was very deliberately chosen. The same is true for the Equality Act which is in congress right now. Equality is great right? Who wouldn't be for that? Dig a little deeper and you will see this bill actually obliterates many sex based rights women have fought long and hard for. But that is another discussion.

I'm getting really tired of members of FDS using the term sex work. There is no such thing. Nobody ever used that term until maybe 1990. It was very deliberately adopted in the press, media and academia to soften the reality of prostitution. Prior to then the focus had been on helping women get out of prostitution and creating an atmosphere where their past wasn't held against them. At no time did anyone see prostitution as legitimate work. Everyone agreed that it was dangerous, traumatizing, degrading and harmful in innumerable ways. Nobody wanted their children or anyone else they loved to become involved in prostitution.

***Prostitution***

***Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for payment. Prostitution is sometimes described as sexual services, commercial sex or, colloquially, hooking. It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as ""the world's oldest profession"" in the English-speaking world. A person who works in this field is called a prostitute and is a type of sex worker.***

Why do they want young women seeing prostitution as legitimate work? Who benefits from that?

There are many more examples of this manipulation of words and many of them are found in the dating world. Almost always the purpose of the euphemism is to give men plausible deniability. It gives them the freedom to lie, mislead, coerce women into sex under false circumstances and use them in other ways (emotional labor, financial abuse etc.) Men will say all kinds of things BUT will accept no responsibility unless they have explicitly defined the relationship. Even then it is not beyond them to move the goalposts.

I urge younger women on this sub to start looking at things through a more critical lens. Ask yourself who benefits, follow the money. Maybe try looking at make up culture and the beauty industry the same way. I don't believe in telling people **what** to think, but I do believe in showing them **how** to think more critically. Don't take things at face value, consider the source, ask yourself who benefits. Does this policy or way of thinking help women as a class?

Many younger women here won't remember that universities, not very long ago, used to have Women's Studies programs. Now they are all called Gender Studies and focus on being inclusive instead of centering women. Think about that. Women carved out a very small space for ourselves in academia only to have it defanged within 20 years. Why did that happen?

There was another thread by a woman who‚Äôs husband of 9 years can‚Äôt handle paying even a single bill from their shared expenses. 

The comments are just ü§¢ On the gift giving thread, the men saying how much anxiety it gives them to choose a gift for their wife, despite knowing she loves plants or [insert common and fun hobby]. A lot of the comments said they ‚Äúworked something out‚Äù in which the wife tells them exactly what gift she wants and where to buy it. It‚Äôs literally not rocket science to find a nice planter and a beautiful plant. You can look at a picture and be like, ‚ÄúDo I see this plant in my house?‚Äù One woman said she wanted her husband to take her on a weekend trip so she planned the entire itinerary, found the Airbnb, sent her husband the link, and told him she wanted to make her pancakes one morning. He had never made pancakes before and it was a ~big deal~. Pancakes?? I learned to make pancakes when I was 10. How many elaborate meals has she made her husband over the years? Learn to make Beef Wellington or GTFO from now on. 

I thought about a scrote I spent 5 years with who, after almost a year together, didn‚Äôt take work off for my birthday party and got me a pack of cigarettes for my birthday present. Even his parents came and gifted me a beautiful scarf that I wore all the time. Our sex life died after year 2 because he stopped showering and brushing his teeth daily. I finally dumped him 10 days before we were supposed to move across the country together when I realized he hadn‚Äôt packed a single box and didn‚Äôt even know on what side of town I was looking for apartments. He had been lying to me about saving money for the move and when I dumped him he lived in his car for a week because he couldn‚Äôt afford a new place until he got paid. 

It just.. it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way! I‚Äôm so glad I finally found the clarity to realize that a NVM really has no value. I think I‚Äôve far too generous in even calling men low value, and sadly no value or negative value men are much more common. Even if you think you‚Äôre getting emotional support or you‚Äôre horny and at least you‚Äôre getting dick.. you could just save the $$$$ you‚Äôre wasting buying this dumbass dinner and pay a QUALIFIED therapist to be your emotional support. You could start building that business you‚Äôve been thinking about forever and at the end of the day you‚Äôre too tired and satisfied from a job well done to even think about faking an orgasm for a man who needs you to buy his mom‚Äôs birthday card.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lsb6kd/i_can_hardly_stomach_relationship_advice_on_other/,1614272367.0,520,0.97,63,FemaleDatingStrategy,birdsandcraftsbitch

lsaa3l,Stop competing with porn stars. You will never win.,"A lot of women have been conditioned to compete with porn stars. I see lots of women bragging on line about how they have the best p*ssy and give the best head. I‚Äôve seen tweets saying stuff along the lines of ‚Äúif your p*ssy is good, he‚Äôll never leave‚Äù or ‚Äúyour p*ssy is trash if he doesn‚Äôt cum in 5 seconds‚Äù , implying that if you get left by a man, it‚Äôs because your sex skills are not good enough, and a lot of women adopt the mentality that if they can outperform porn stars and do gymnastics in the bedroom, give him the best of best head,  then men will want to commit and stick around longer. If they can do all that, then he‚Äôll never have a reason to leave or look at other women. The reality is YOU ARE NOT HIS PERSONAL PORN STAR. These women are fantasies that can never be lived up to and you will be disappointed every time when you jump through hoops learning all these sex skills, and doing gymnastics in bed to please him, only for him to still be non-commital and beat his meat to his fantasy girl . You can do all of that and he could still cheat, leave...etc. Your sex skills are not a measurement of how loyal and committed men will be. Also stop doing things you‚Äôre uncomfortable with to be his fantasy woman . It‚Äôs never worth it .

ls6dfg,The misogyny of MAFS.,"The latest season of Married at First Sight has just begun in Australia. They call this show 'the experiment' and they're not wrong. It's a petrie dish of abuse. We are witnessing the birth of textbook abusive relationships in real time. It's alarming to watch these single-for-a-reason men groom (oh, how apropos) their innocent victims when you know how to spot the signs. 

Within the first few days of knowing each other:

Groom #1 told his wife that she didn't have kind of look he'd approach in a bar. Flicked her hair with disdain, commenting ""at least you have the right hair colour"". Gave her the silent treatment when she questioned if he was in it for the right reasons, reducing her to tears. Forced her to grovel and apologise for upsetting him. Later admitted to cheating on previous girlfriends, but said he didn't like to be called a cheater because it's not who he is. 

Groom #2 had sex on the first night. His wife peppered him with questions the next day about whether or not he felt closer to her as a person. Literally couldn't answer the question, stared off into the distance while she babbled how close she felt to him. Eventually stammered ""yeah, yeah, definitely felt closer"" with a stupid grin on his face while she caressed his inner thigh and gazed adoringly at him. 

Groom #3 openly ogled his wife as she walked down the aisle. Ran his eyes up and down her body and stared at her breasts. Said in his confessional that she was his dream girl but only mentioned her physical attributes. Brought her to a lake and started a mindless mouth-breathing conversation about the view, then tried to kiss her during an awkward pause. After being rejected, shamed her for her lack of effort at creating intimacy between them. 

Groom #4 appeared excited at the sight of his fitness trainer wife at the wedding, but muttered ""oh God"" when she started to speak. Expressed his displeasure at how 'extra' and 'loud' she was. Confessed to dumping previous girlfriends for not having big enough boobs saying that he can't help what he's attracted to. Told her he was trying his best to 'guide his way through' her negative traits.

The worst part of this show is the so-called 'experts', the matchmakers, the relationship coaches and bullshit sexologists, telling these women who reveal their 'husbands' entitled, pornsick behaviour at the end of every damn week, that they just need to communicate more and try harder to create a romantic connection with a stranger with whom they've been forced to cohabitate. 'Give him a chance', they encourage the women who express reservations about his behaviour or straight up admit they just aren't attracted to him. 

The most depressing thing, though, is how the show is a deadly accurate microcosm of real life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ls6dfg/the_misogyny_of_mafs/,1614259061.0,116,0.98,13,FemaleDatingStrategy,thebonecarrier

ls5w1u,Male Egos are so fucking fragile.,"I don't know how many of you watch D'Angelo Wallace on YT (he's great). He did a [recent video on Britney Spears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GegdKMHnxxY), the Netflix Documentary and her conservatorship (which in and of itself is so fucking disgusting. How her sperm donor is getting away with it is unbelievable. But patriarchy keep doing it's thing eh. Still the days of having women institutionalised for not conforming.).

While the whole video is great, one scene has stuck with me for a few days now.

At around [2:52](https://youtu.be/GegdKMHnxxY?t=172)

The male show host who must be in his 60s is asking a **10 year old** Britney: 

""Do you have a boyfriend?""  
Britney: ""No Sir"".  
Host: ""Why not?""  
Britney: ""They're mean!""  
(Audience laughs)  
**Host:  ""Boyfriends? You mean all boys? You mean me? I'm not mean, how about me?""**

OH MY FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOD.

Aside from the utterly disgusting sexualisation of a 10 year old child, this whole scene stuck out to me because of the jaw dropping egocentric way this 60 year old scrote is acting on stage.

""YoU mEaN Me? I'm NoT mEaN"" screeched the fucking 60 year old man child because an actual, literal child is disgusted by the idea of boys, which is just so normal for that age.

lry7jw,Why you can‚Äôt take BDSM into your new HVW life.,"I know what it feels like to *stumble* upon this sub and feel a whirlwind of emotions. Clarity. Anger. Enlightenment. Resistance. Peace. Rebellion. 

BDSM is one of those things, I know. Some of us came from a world of kink, empowered by our libfem faux-sexual liberation, and we believe we are consenting adults asking men to hurt us...in the bedroom.

**I thought I needed it.** I didn‚Äôt know what porn sickness was and how deeply it had shifted my understanding of sexual pleasure. I felt so disconnected during sex without it. Distracted, dissociated, and bored. I needed a kick to get me there (mentally). 

I also never really slept with men who cared about me much. Sure, some men fought for me, cried for me, did me favors, and followed me around my world ‚Äî but when it came down to it, they were selfish, sex-obsessed, and lazy. 

**Of course I felt bored during sex.** I needed to meet a man who cared about me so deeply that his heart broke when I told him how disconnected I felt after our first time. I needed a man who made it point, every single time we had sex, to both keep me very interested and maintain a connection with me. I needed to see what sex should look like to recognize that BDSM was a bandaid to cover the real issue ‚Äî  the men I slept with didn‚Äôt truly care about me enough. 

**I‚Äôll save you the trouble of needing a man** to get there by telling you: when two people truly care about each other, the sex is always fun, intense, or ideally both at once. It‚Äôs beyond any simulated rush. It‚Äôs like sub space except you experience it *together*. After, you feel so physically thrilled and full of his love that the last thing you need is for him to provide aftercare. 

No matter what you get out of BDSM (in which you‚Äôre the receiver/sub), you cannot justify that **on the other end of it is a man who gains pleasure from your pain, degradation, and/or humiliation.**

Doing such things would make a HVM feel weird, like he was acting some part. He‚Äôd be too uncomfortable to even pretend well enough. 

Even if he‚Äôs there because you like it and he just wants to please you, **no worthwhile man can hurt you in those ways** and soundly lay his head to rest at night. 

It would cause him to feel sick and sad if he tried; and he‚Äôd crave folding you up in his arms and telling you how safe you are with him. 

This is basic conscientiousness, queens. You deserve a GOOD guy if you choose to be with one. **A good guy would feel **terrified** to press down on your neck enough to prevent you from breathing.**

Stop ignoring what it means that a man would be okay with treating you that way. Only a depraved man would find it acceptable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lry7jw/why_you_cant_take_bdsm_into_your_new_hvw_life/,1614227602.0,192,0.95,15,FemaleDatingStrategy,pickadaisy

I dumped him over a year ago, and I still got scared thinking he was walking my way. But after that brief moment of panic, I stopped and was grateful for knowing I deserved better and dumping him.

lroh3w,Vet ALL the men in your life. Even the ones you won't consider dating.,"Sharing this story because I feel this is very important. Mods, feel free to tell me I've got the wrong flair, this is my first time posting.

Bit of background for context, I work for a specialty construction company. The labor market in construction is absolutely saturated with felons and NVM, and since we're specialty the skills we look for are fairly rare we regularly hire felons but we do draw a hard line at violent crimes and fraud. HR is part of my job, and I screen and vet all applicants before I forward the application and my findings to the owner.

We interviewed a man today that I did not get a chance to screen first. He was an acquaintance of someone who already worked here, and the employee knew my process, knew this guy wouldn't get past my initial vet, so he went over my head to the owner to set up an interview. Now, on the application we ask 'Have you ever been convicted of a felony?"" and if they answer yes they are required to provide an explanation before the application will advance. Any time I see 'I'll explain at the interview' or some variation thereof, my bullshit meter goes ding-ding-ding and I start googling them like I'm trying to date them.

One of the first places I look is the federal sex offender registry. Welp he's on there, name and current address match the application. However, this is the first time I've ever seen the word violent along with rape and sodomy. I have a detective friend in LA who told me before that if I ever see the word violent on someone's record, it's there for a *damn good reason*.

The more I dig, the worse it gets. This man kidnapped a 16 year old girl at knifepoint with a friend, transported her across state lines, and they raped her repeatedly. For almost 24 hours she was at the mercy of these men. I cannot provide any more details, but the court docs were sickening to read. 

I forwarded all this to the owner. Told him to read at his own risk, and that I would not be participating this interview like I usually do, and that I did not want this man to be associated with the company and hoped he would cancel the interview. My gut is never wrong about evil people, and to sit in a room with this man I would have been physically sick. After the interview they told me what he said when asked to explain his felony. It's obvious he felt no remorse for his actions, and was only trying to avoid going to jail. Apparently he led with ""well I'm no pervert, and I was only giving that girl a ride to McDonalds"". He spent 30 years in jail and just got released in January. His friend is in for 80. After the interview the owner called his parole officer, who confirmed it all.

Had I not dug around and found this I might be working with this man, because nobody else here would have thought to look him up. There are times I am at the office alone, and while I am well armed and trained I do not want to tempt fate. The thought makes me shake.

lrjr9x,The great disparity between sex-workers (TW: graphic abuse and sexual violence),"...is extremely striking if you scroll through a webcamming site even just for a few minutes. As a disclaimer, I obviously do not support the porn industry and try to stay away from it, but sometimes I do get curious to see the interactions between men and models on these sites and open my eyes even more to this fucked up industry. 

Anyways, the differences between the privileged models, who more or less were not pressured externally to do this (meaning its obvious they dont do it just to survive) and the ones that were obviously coerced into it so they dont starve is so..disheartening to say the least. 

On one hand, you have these privileged models charging large amounts of money for really \*vanilla\*, basic stuff (Im not shaming their prices or their acts, its obviously a good thing to exploit these pornsick men as much as you can while youre at it- Im just trying to highlight the differences), from the comfort of their own rooms or a really clean, nice-looking studio; discussing with clients, making small talk; laughing. of course many of them are faking it to SOME degree, but also they dont seem particularly distressed. Most of them can end the stream whenever they please. 

On the other hand, you have these girls that my heart breaks for. Being slapped extremely hard numerous times, gagged, choked, spit on. You know the deal. For hours on end. I feel especially angry when I see them looking over the camera at presumably their pimp/john, looking so fucking scared and terrified for their life. They literally beg them to stop the scene with their eyes.  But they dont. They keep going and going. Then you see the comments, saying all types of slurs (sl\*t, wh\*re..you know the deal). Or saying racist shit like \*yes, Colombians are such good \*insert slur\*\*. 

I dont know what to say honestly. I am speechless and angry at the world. I am angry at myself cause I cant do anything for these girls (or maybe we can?). At the same times how can I even find out a way to contact them without these abusers knowing? Its literally so difficult.

To the people saying shit like \*LiStEn tO sEx-WoRkErS!!!!\*, you are disgusting. You cant even recognize the extreme privileged position you have in this world to even be able to say shit like this all day long. All while these girls are suffering on a well-known platform. If these girls would tell this to their bosses, they will get even more abused, cause these abusers dont fucking care. Why dont you get it already? The large majority of SW-ers are not respected by their abusers and by those complicit in the abuse (meaning the scrotes who pay). They literally have no voice, because their voice is being drowned by the disgusting dicks they have to keep in their mouths all day long, suffering all types of abuse.  

But we are the SWERFS, right? Libfems really did a number on so many people supporting this industry that THRIVES on abuse.

lrg684,Woke up from a fog last night. I promised myself I would NEVER allow a man to abuse me again... I failed,"Hey all, longtime lurker, first time poster. I have been in two physically and mental abusive realtionships as a young woman and then after I vowed I would never allow a man to do that to me agian. I almost swore off dating but also would simply drop men over ""minor things"" to others but on here you would all agree were huge red flags. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what happened to me but 6 years ago I let my guard down and have been ""taken to the cleaners"" emotionally, finacially, and physically by a man who does everything in his power to keep up a facade of being a kind, loving and basically perfect man. To everyone around us, he's a dream and does so much for me. The truth is he has taken over every aspect of my life to the point where I feel like a prisoner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course we married and had children, sadly, this was before I realized how bad he was of course. I wish I could go back in time so badly. 

&amp;#x200B;

It happened gradually with boundery pushing and testing little by little. Emotional manipulation and guilt tripping followed by love bombing.  I also believe he has been gaslighting me. I now write down what was said after conversations so I can trust my own memory.

&amp;#x200B;

I am the only one who works, I've asked in the past and also many times we talked about it over the past year that he would get a job but that still hasn't happened. Even though I make all the money he is constantly begging me to take our money from our account for spending money or to send money to family or make irresponsible purchases that we don't need when we basically have just enough to cover our bills and live paycheck to paycheck. Even though I say we can't afford it, he makes me feel guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

The final straw has come, I found out he has a secret source of income that he repeatedly lied about. While our family was struggling to get basic necessities.  He had actually been getting almost $15,000 a year. thats over an extra thousand a month that we could have been using to stay current on our bills and even save and actually have psending money. Meanwhile, he is begging me for a share of my paycheck for spending money when in fact he had so much all along AND I HAD NONE. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about the audacity to ask for money from our bill paying accoutn when he had the amount of cash in the bank and was spending it freely it literally makes me feel sick.  I could not buy necesseties like food at some points this year (partically due to covid as well making our overall income less), haven't been on vacaton since we got married and can't buy new cloths and shoes when my old ones are worn out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I discovered the money secret because he started spedning like crazy buying some electronics that  I KNEW were super expensive. He spent over $5,000 on electronics while unemployed and we had no money for groceries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then recently he asked me how much of the stimulus check we could use to ""for fun"" when I have a lot of credit card debt now due to any emergancy needing to go on credit cards and sometimes grocieries as well when we run out of my paycheck income. I said we need to use it to pay bills and put money in savings and he has been whinig about it so I gave in. That was before I found out about the secret money. He also asked me if we could help out a family member with some of it.... apparently 1000 a month isnt enough free spending money for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to leave and get a divorce but the truth is I am scared. He has never physically abused me but he has recently broken some of my things during arguments and in general is screaming and seems out of control. I am also scared to leave him with my children because I feel not only that the lying shows how little I know the ""real"" him but also the screaming and breaking things makes me worried.  

 But I have to continue to go to work or we will be destitute. I don't know what to do first or where to turn. I've called a few attorneys and left messages and I'm waiting on hold with a domestic violence chatline. I'm just feeling so defeated, sad and really scared for the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lrg684/woke_up_from_a_fog_last_night_i_promised_myself_i/,1614182388.0,128,0.96,3,FemaleDatingStrategy,MadeAMistake8251

lrbudm,A list of all the amazing things you bring to any relationship as a reminder,"I had a horrible experience dating a 38 year old in December. Proper potbelly, skinny limbs, balding, crooked teeth, unwashed sweatpants etc. etc., kicked me out of his bed &amp; house the next morning because he needed to play videogames, after sleeping together for the first time after several dates, proceeded to ignore me (not even a 'did you get home ok text) and then texted me several days later, on NYE, how I am 'too bitchy' and he is simply 'too nice'... Somehow that didn't really seemed to be an issue before and during he was 'hitting it'.)

I suppose I should really thank the idiot, because whilst I was crying (laughing about this now), and frantically googling what the hell was wrong with ME, I came across this sub. 

Though I am certainly still only a pickmeisha in recovery and no queen yet, I am very proud to say I am following the handbook and the quality of my dates has already improved exponentially. 

One thing I am currently truggling with after my many years of being gaslighted and abused by scrotes, being the 'cool' girl &amp; playing their 'mommy', is the question as to what I have to offer without all of that. 

Why would anyone want to date me if I don't build them up? Cook &amp; clean for them? Accommodate them in whatever way possible? 

I decided to make a list of all that I have to bring to a relationship and all a man benefits from by being with me, by me just being me. It has put the biggest smile on my face and gave me the confidence to continue on my FDS path. 

Below some examples from my list; I encourage all of you girls to create your own and marvel at all that you are and have to bring to a relationship, men will be INCREDIBLY lucky to have you &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

* Interesting conversation ((law)philosophy, art, linguistics, politics, tech);
* Charming, elegant, classy, well travelled; will lift your social standing just by being associated with me; 
* Kind, genuine, loyal &amp; faithful; 
* Caring, will go through hell &amp; back for family and friends if needed; 
* Good taste and the ability to turn any space into a classy, clean &amp; tidy home;
* Great sounding board and the ability to offer well thought out advice regarding career-related questions; 
* Supportive; Those around me benefit from my network, advise and hands-on support if needed; 
* Able to adjust to most situations with ease (lived in 3 countries);
* Opinionated; those around me benefit from my well researched and thought out perspective on a range of different subjects; 
* Willing to sacrifice my body in order to give myself and a man a family; 
* Spontaneous, fun and not afraid to try new things. 
* Etc.!  


Looking at the above I am almost embarrassed I ever doubted myself... Any men is lucky to be even considered as an option.

This has been backed up by my dating history- my ex NVM shamed me if I wore heels.

lr26y8,The High-Value Aunt I never knew I had.,"Make a cup of tea and get cozy, this is a long one!

This story is about my Aunt whom I never fully understood until after I found FDS. My grandmother had 13 pregnancies, 3 of which were miscarriages.  When my grandmother was pregnant with my aunt the doctor told her to abort the baby or she will die. He also told her that the fetus is disfigured and she's better off getting rid of it anyway. My grandmother refused and said she'll take the risk and never consider aborting her baby. She ended up giving birth to a healthy baby girl naturally without any complications. One of my aunts leg's is 3 inches shorter than the other and she has 4 toes instead of 5 on each foot. She's beautiful and extremely smart. She walks with a limp and her whole life she's been called ""the cripple"" by her classmates, neighbors, and the town people.

She's my mother's sister and lives in a 3rd world country where the average salary is around $100/ a month. It's a purely mysoginistic country where a women's worth is considered to be based off of if: a woman is married, how many kids she has, how well she cooks and cleans, and her ability to always obey mens orders. Basically, a Queen's worst nightmare of a country.

When I was 8 years old my grandma sent her to live with us (1st world country) in the hopes that someone might accept her as a wife and her life would ""have meaning"". My dad would try to vet men before letting them meet her. I remember how she used to get ready. She'd wear her hair in a weird way, wear casual wear, and exaggerate her limp when meeting the guys my dad set her up with. I asked her once why she didn't wear her pretty dresses and she grinned and said, ""You think I actually want him?""

She lived with us for 3 years. In those 3 years she refined her English while babysitting, then started tutoring kids. She worked really hard. I remember she'd babysit during the day, pick me up from school, then walk to her different clients homes where she tutored kids and helped with homework. At the time she was only paid $8 an hour. While staying with us she insisted on paying 1/3 of the rent to my parents. My dad refused at first, then accepted it.

After the 3 years my grandmother had a stroke. My aunt heard that two of her siblings had a fight over who WOULDN'T take care of my grandma and my aunt decieded to return to her home country. I later found out that before she left my dad gave her an envelope filled with all the money she had given him for rent. He had saved it aside for her and gave it to her before she left.

When my aunt returned to her 3rd world home country, she took special care of my grandmother and helped her recover. It's ironic that the child the doctors tried aborting ended up loving and caring for her the most. KARMA!

This is where it gets really good. My aunt used her savings from her hard work and bought a peice of land, bought farming equipment, hired a few town folk, and started a farm. She has a TON of olive trees (also pomegranite, figs, grapes, and lemons). She has an oil press machine. There are a lot of poor and hungry people and she made this amazing picking system. People who want free olives or olive oil could pick as much as their heart desires and they get to keep half of what they picked. The rest she presses into oil and sells.

Well. I didn't want to believe it and silly me, I trusted my SO after we had a heart to heart and he SWORE to me no more secrets were in the works and yet here I am.  


Background information: My SO has a BAD problem with porn, like toe curling obsession with it. With our last big fight I discovered he was routinely downloading porn from all sites under the sun and also took a disgusting habit of collecting pictures from insta.   
I confronted him, and told him he fixes his issues or he'll lose me. No wiggle room..   


He swore to me it would stop - all media accounts are cut off, all porn obsession curted, and PAID porn subscriptions cancelled..   


Well. Here I am doing our taxes, setting our finances right for the next up coming months because its been hell and back for us financially... I see a charge on his bank statement that just says the following:  


Help.com 19.99 reoccurring charge.   


My damn instincts kicked in. What a strange site name, no description and going back for at least a year or so each month around this time.   


I finally had a break in the case with a phone number attached to the information from the bank detailing the charge. Its to a damn Porn search Site-   
All and all this guy had been paying nearly 30+ dollars a month on Porn.. I'm sad and frustrated, when he comes home I will detail what I found, watch him squirm to explain himself and end it on the spot.

lqywvo,Beauty standards are a prison.,"Recently, I pulled out some pictures of myself from elementary school. I‚Äôm almost 40. While I remember only pieces of this painful and lonely time in my life, I remember perfectly how I *felt*. 

I can‚Äôt remember a moment I was free of disparaging thoughts about myself. *I was so fat. My thighs were big. My hair was out of control with frizz. I just wasn‚Äôt pretty like other girls.*

Except...the pictures say otherwise. I‚Äôm quite a little twig like a lot of girls are at those ages, and while I had skinner friends beside me in photos, I was still ‚Äúskinny‚Äù. My thighs were shapely as they are today ‚Äî but twigs like my arms. I thought my arms had always been fat? Huh? Don‚Äôt get me started on my hair... it‚Äôs shiny, a sun-kissed brunette mane of long wavy curls. 

I was so damn beautiful but I was so damn brainwashed. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

There are no true beauty standards. That clich√© about the ‚Äúeye of the beholder‚Äù could not be more true. The qualities in a man I‚Äôve loved have not been the same qualities society said were worth love. 

Beauty, by nature, is beyond comparison. One thing isn‚Äôt more beautiful than another; rather, things have a beauty to them. Sure, grass is objectively less stunning then a rose. But there‚Äôs nothing more beautiful than lying on soft grass on a nice day and looking up at the sky. 

Sometimes the very things you‚Äôve never loved about yourself are the things others find lovable about you - including the parts of yourself you thought were ‚Äúugly‚Äù. I never much liked the way my natural finger nails looked, but a boyfriend once paused in the middle of the kitchen to point out to me that he loved my hands. I‚Äôve learned I can‚Äôt be in charge of how others see me, including what they‚Äôve chosen to see as my beauty. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

We live in the patriarchy, and we cannot ever forget it. I spent years awash in libfem BS from magazines, television and movies, music, books, my social circle, my family, and ‚Äî later ‚Äî social media. I‚Äôve spent my whole life wishing to change literally everything about myself because I bought what they sold me - the idea that I wasn‚Äôt already so damn beautiful. 

This made me feel desperate. 

I hid parts of myself in shame. 

I hurt myself in numerous ways hoping it would fix the problem when the problem was never about me to begin with. 

And all the while, those ideas distracted me enough to keep me from discovering how beneficial it is for men if I don‚Äôt like myself. 

They profit financially from the ideas. 
They build success upon the very ideas. 
They use the ideas to manipulate us into desperation. 

They stay in power.

Ive been single for about 2 years and inbetween then and now was just hooking up, knowing full well i wasnt ready/didnt want a relationship. 

I feel a great pulling within myself to chase other things in my life instead of hookups and relationships. There always seems to be the nagging little voice that tells me how alone i'll end up and while that's probably very likely, how can i end up alone but happy/content with my own life? 

I want to persue writing and fitness but is that really enough at the end of the day? I dont keep many friends...at all. Family arent great so really, im forced into the loneliness anyhow, i dont think any relationship would be so wonderful to save me from feeling that way.

lqu37v,"Women, be aware of what LVM calls ""Kino"".","Lots of male users and some RedPillers describe practices like kino ( **kino or ESCALATION** is short for kinesthetic approach, meaning physical touch) of invading a woman's space without her noticing and start pushing her towards a hookup. They use different strategies depending on the environment with the sole purpose of being undetected and isolating the target/ evaluating your responsiveness to being touched. This is how they think:

https://preview.redd.it/cujjui9rsaj61.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3135ea0e54d60f9ca5d1632622fbbbd44f4a062

Basically, it's when the guy gets handsy with you, he' tries this while looking for clues that he can proceed further sexually. Google ""Billy's guide to Kino"", scroll down, read.

Lots of guys I know (young and old) sincerely believe women are unable to make decisions and need to be ""warmed up"" and pushed in the right direction because they can't logically decide if they want a guy. So they learn how to **ESCALATE** (yes, that's a thing).

Here's a quote:

*"" The way it works is that you want to fuck the girl (at the very least, you want to get a kiss at the end of the night). You simply CANNOT fuck a girl without establishing some sort of physical intimacy beforehand (with a few exceptions I guess). It's just gonna make it a thousand times more awkward if you go for a kiss after 3 hours of talking but no touching. That kiss is gonna be the first time you make physical contact with her. That's gonna be weird, assuming it even happens, and a lot of times it won't even happen because you haven't set up the sort of situation that allows for it (which you set up with kino).*

*Also, it allows you to ""invade"" another person's ""personal space""- when done correctly, you barge right into their personal space and they immediately become more comfortable with you (because it was natural). Once they've allowed you into that space, it becomes that much easier to push the boundaries and take it further.""*

Example from Reddit:

https://preview.redd.it/nfwq8wpysaj61.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a75141851ad382ce243cdf26d8b90297a06363

Here's what they say about it: ""The reason kino is important is aside from its aforementioned benefits and uses, it builds connection.""

Please google  ""*a guide to Kino Reddit*"" or ""*guide to escalation seduction reddit*""  to see the strategies they use.

Example of strategies:

https://preview.redd.it/izinaf4d5bj61.png?width=769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3184c60b39360637de692ff439cdb5c9b6b1493f

Especially younger women need to be aware that they do it to test the waters, starting from non-sexual things to determine if they have a chance (and most will believe they're 100% correct in reading women's signals).

The kino they try to use is practiced to look **innocent to help them omit responsibility in case you notice it so they can back off if you're not interested, or call you crazy, it's never should be obvious to a woman.**

Please, ladies, BOUNDARIES. Define and make them known!

Update: I've noticed that some women on this sub are taking this post literally thinking it's solely about a homeless-looking man trying to kiss or touch them out of nowhere in a dark alley. Not really. It can start with a nicely shaved and dressed HWM on paper asking you out on a date, then start pulling small moves like the ones above. If the end goal is to get laid they will adjust based on their environment setting (they won't be too rapey or pushy on a date but build up your comfort level to escalate later...).

lqtgb2,"My friend introduced her new boyfriend to us. He talked about getting a blow job from a prostitute, made several jealous remarks, was physically violent and accused my friend of cheating on her with my husband. She is still with him. What the actual...?!","Hi! This is my first post here, I need some advice regarding my friend and this is also kind of a rant, because I can't even process this guy... I hope it's okay and I'm not breaking any rules here.

Last Saturday, my closest friend introduced her new boyfriend to us. They have been together for about 2 months now and the guy is an utter tool. So, it was her, the guy, my husband and I. We played some board games, drank a little and tried to get to know him. 

Just a few things about the guy that didn't sit right with me:

* He is a very... well, simple man, to word it nicely. It was hard to talk to him about anything.
* He had about a dozen jealous remarks during the evening, talked about how he went through my friends phone, he doesn't trust her and he doesn't like that she has 2 male friends.
* When he complained about how little vodka my friend put in his drink, I jokingly said that it's probably because the last time she brought over a guy to introduce to us, he got so drunk that they had to leave very early and my friend had to basically carry him home. So now she is more careful with pouring alcohol. He started asking me when this happened, saying ""last time"" suggests it was very recently. I told him it was 2 years ago, he kept saying that ""last time"" doesn't mean 2 years ago and he started counting months and such.
* He said he never played board games before and he got frustrated several times with my friend, when my husband and I beat them (it was 2 against 2). He said ""Fuck you, how the fuck did you think that me saying x meant x...""
* He randomly started talking about how pathetic prostitutes are. My friend and I told him off, told him that most prostitutes are forced into it, almost all started out underage in our country, some were forced by their fathers, etc and if he wants to call someone pathetic, he should call the men that, who pay for such services. He then asked us why paying for a blow job made him pathetic, told us how he went to ""wh\*res"" before and turned to my husband asking him if he ever went to a prostitute and said that he doesn't believe that he hasn't YET.
* We told him a story about my friend coming to our city, the two of us going to a concert, getting drunk, sitting in broken glass, etc and my husband taking us home to out apartment. It was a funny lighthearted story my friend told laughingly. Well, the guy said that my friend shouldn't laugh, there is nothing funny about this. The 3 of us stared at him, not understanding what he meant. As it turned out, he thought that my friend sleeping on our couch after a concert meant that she and my husband slept together?? Because where he is from, that's what happens after concerts. On festivals, he sleeps with different women ever day and once, he and his friend ""shared"" a girl. She was the friends ""girlfriend"" for 2 days, she was his on the 3rd and his friends again on the 4th.
* When I went to the bathroom, he straight out asked my husband and her if they were having an affair. He was very upset and basically accused my friend of cheating on him with my husband (?????), but they managed to convince him that they are not a thing and he calmed down.
* During the evening, he grabbed my friend by her arm and pulled her down close to the ground several times. When my friend said that it hurts and asked him to stop and let her go, he didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

After they left, I genuinely thought that my friend will break up with the guy immediately or the latest when she sobers up. Well, she didn't. The whole evening left me shocked and I don't know how to approach this with my friend. I already told her that basically everything is wrong with that guy, but he ""never acted like that before"" and he apologized to her about the jealous fits the next day so she is not breaking up with him.

lqregy,Please talk some sense into me *age gap*,"Hi ladies,

I am in need of advice. I don't want to post in the relationship subs because you know how terrible they are.
I am a 22 yo woman who is extremely attracted to a 35 yo man. I have been feeling attracted to him for over a year now and I really really can't stop feeling this way. I started to think that I owe it to myself to at least try approaching him, but in the same time I am very aware that this is highly inappropriate. Do age gaps always have to be terrible? I am in a big need of a more experienced woman who can speak some sense into me. Feeling this way is making me desperate.



Update:
Thank you all for your answers. They were helpful and I am sure that I don't want to approach him anymore. There were some good points that you ladies made that really made me think. After some reflection I think I found out that I have some problems that I really need to work on that are making me feel desperate about that man.
First of all, I think I have some self esteem issues that I need to reflect deeper on, which make me feel like I don't deserve a good man at my age. Thoughts like ""Why would a nice young handsome man at my age would want to be with me?"" cross my mind, so I need to work on that.
There was also a comment pointing out that I may feel bored and after reflecting for a while I noticed that I was not feeling that attracted to him when I was doing things that I enjoyed like going on trips with my friends. 
And the last thing that I want to share is that there was a very good advice to actually make it a ""homework"" to find someone at my age to feel attracted to. I decided to do that along with the other things that I mentioned.

Phrases like ""What are we"" and ""We need to talk about our relationship"" are always portrayed as something horrible that a woman says and ""ruins"" the whole fun. But it's not. Let's stop believing that.

lqqqqg,I want to live for me!,"After discovering FDS I feel like a fog has lifted and I can see clearly. I am guilty for being a pickmeisha but happy to leave that version of me behind. 

After a recent experience of being stood up and gaslighted by a NVM I couldn‚Äôt understand my disappointment/hurt and despair. I used to wonder if it stinks everywhere I go then I should check under my shoe right? Maybe I am the problem. Sure 90% of the men I met were walking red flags but how could it possibly be that all of them were bad? I used to wonder that maybe I‚Äôm the type of girl men only want casual shit with. But coming here has made me realise it‚Äôs not my problem, most men are trash. 

I have finally realised that I am beautiful and wonderful without the validation of a single fucking man! And it feels so liberating. Earlier I‚Äôd want to lose weight/look good to make dating easier. But fuck that shit. I want to look good for myself, I want to level up to experience life from a different perspective all together. And the fact that I don‚Äôt have to prove anything to anyone is soooooo liberating ‚ù§Ô∏è I can‚Äôt wait to do things simply for me. Life is going to be fun and I can already tell :)

lqp18l,Motherhood-,"It still astounds me how high the expectations for mothers is, compared to men's expectations as fathers.

Once we become mothers we are expected to either be a *slave to our husband* or be a *slave to capitalism.* Cooking, cleaning, pleasuring our hubby in bed, taking care of children, all while working a 9 to 5 job. You would think that all that hard work would be appreciated but it isn't. 

If you dare conserve time for yourself you're deemed as selfish, irresponsible and a horrible mother while the father gets to drink beer and play video games on the couch. As a wife and mother it's your **job** to keep everyone joyful, it's your fault if your husband cheats on you maybe you should've set time aside for you guys.

""Doesn't matter what he did he's still the child's father, he deserves to see them"" - women are guilted to let their toxic abusive baby daddies see their children. Can't ask a deadbeat for child support even though you're financially struggling because you're forcing them into parenthood. Where's the same energy for fathers?

Single and teen moms are villainized by society and single dads get love and reassurance. Oh you're a single mom? No one wants to date damaged goods, your child will turn out horrible from his lack of a father figure, you should have chosen a better man, and so on. So you're a single father? Praised for staying, guaranteed that people will date you women love children, constantly victimized and etc. I bet you rarely hear of the word teen dad, yeah me too let that sink in for a bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lqp18l/motherhood/,1614104198.0,144,0.97,12,FemaleDatingStrategy,Velvettcum

lqmzln,There are worse things than dying alone.,"My mother married an ephebophile when I was 6. He constantly made weird comments disguised as jokes and effortlessly groomed my mother to start being immune to his ‚Äúhumor‚Äù and inappropriate behavior, so by the time I was an adolescent, he could just outright start leering at me, giving me compliments that would have gotten him slapped by grown women, being possessive of me, and just generally being a scumbag out in the open.

Needless to say, by the time I graduated from college, I literally got on a plane and flew to the other side of the planet. Eventually I had the courage to confront my mom but she of course was too delusional to take any action other than to systematically turn all family against me, save for one sibling.

A few years ago, after ten years of being cancer-free (her recovery of course was no thanks to her strategically incompetent, bumbler of a husband), my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She died last year at home after suddenly being unable to breathe, with her piece of shit husband no doubt being too out of shape and unhealthy himself to properly perform CPR. Her last moments were spent with this disgusting human hovered over her. No comfort. No hope to hang onto. Just the same desolation she resigned herself to for the 30 years of their marriage.

My mom‚Äôs marriage cost her any chance at a real relationship with me, but it also required her to numb herself into oblivion. She may have died in 2020 but she essentially made herself dead to me nearly a decade before, and more than that, she gave up decades of her life to a toxic relationship with an alcoholic man.  She lied to herself about everything. She lied to everyone who cared about her too. She was not able to be authentic with anyone. She never worked on her shit. She was desperately codependent and pretended that she enjoyed her miserable relationship.

Her husband lives on, now even more pathetic than before. His drinking is getting worse. He neglects the house. He is barely functioning. My half sister lives with him (temporary situation). She tells me every time we talk that he is spiraling, that our mother did so much for him and he essentially acts helpless without her. He can‚Äôt even get his shit together enough to provide a temporary sanctuary to the only child who loves him. This is the legacy my mother leaves behind for the child she did love.

lqlsbk,"Keeping my ship on course, Equality vs Social Equity: misogynists hijacked Feminism by an inside job and they'll keep hurting the hostages.","In the last several years, we have observed false balance or false equivalency in media reporting and politics. For example, the former Trump government equating a major failing to a minor issue in Obama's of a completely different nature. Another example is equating the argument from a minority of climate change deniers to the mass of evidence proving its existence.

Creating equivalence between two sides is appealing because it can be presented as rational thinking. It is a lazy way to avoid antagonising either group but it hides the truth. It is a logical fallacy based on flawed reasoning and inconsistency. 

On the face of it, it gives equal weight to both sides of a debate. However the sides are seldom identical and this approach requires that evidence is oversimplified, not compared, not scrutinized or is not given correct significance. An avalanche of factual evidence for one side can even be ignored completely and equated to the mere opinion of a non qualified person. 

This practice has been responsible for much of the spreading of misinformation we regularly see and apathy from observers who decide that one party is as bad as another, they're all the same and there is no real issue. It helps preserve the status quo and in the worst case opens the door to sensationalism where arguments are not rigorously interrogated for their validity. E.g widespread myth that custody courts inherently favour mothers.

We know well that misogynists use false balance to try and hijack women's pursuit of our rights and drown out women's voices. They turn energy towards themselves by claiming unequal treatment. They flood the platform with tit for tat superficial statements in order to deflect focus away from the specified topic. E.g. 'not all men' / 'women perpetrate domestic violence too' / 'rape is committed against men too'.

Most men aren't speaking in good faith. They enjoy their privileged lives and take them for granted too much. For them it's the natural order of things, just like breathing. There is no need to question or change what's not hurting them. Some may even believe that since they are happy and the streets aren't a war zone, there's no real problem. Most men enjoy subjugating women with impunity and savouring our suffering. Even the day to day doses from the negging of a stranger glean enough emotional hurt to feed them like demons.

The patriarchy is hijacking 'equality' till it bastardizes the very meaning of feminism and results in even more benefit for men at women's cost. 

Men cherrypick what to be equal on. Few of them are clamouring for equal pay for equal jobs, to do equal domestic work, caring for children and the infirm or simply delivering orgasms to their woman sexual partners at the rate men have them and (threateningly) demand them. 

Many 'sex positive' LibFems are in a Faustian pact. They bypassed the T's &amp; C's in their ignorance or eagerness to please. They look no different from people using self destructive behaviours to try to feel in control of something they don't realise is irrelevant and deep down fear that they can't change - men's lack of respect for them as equally valuable and equally human. They seek approval from men by exploiting one of the ways men already devalue them as women and rush to exonerate these men by claiming to freely choose it and to exercise informed consent. They do not accept that no woman is exempt from men's reward for devaluing themselves.

As we know, where one woman goes, if it benefits men, most will try to demand that all women go there. A man uses his ability to disrespect one woman as a manipulation point to weaken others's refusal of the same treatment. Eventually it becomes an expectation and entitlement pursued by a growing group of men. Men who feel entitled are dangerous. We know this. And here, this type of LibFem opens the door for men to hijack feminism under the guise of encouraging 'sex positivity'.

Misogynists don't admire women for seeking to please them. They will take what they can and seek to shame women just the same, just because they can. Those women who sought to please sexually are reminded they are not respected, regardless of their 'sex positivity' and forced to pay a price whenever their past is discovered.

Men excel at milking a stream of benefit from an opportunity and kicking away responsibilities, reciprocation or obligations. The patriarchy is trying to engineer movement towards a point where a women's life under hijacked feminism only varies from that under male chauvinism in ways which benefit men:
- women also work, employers keep benefitting from wage gap and men keep the unearned financial advantage and ego boost
- women pay at least half when financing a household with a man (we know it's really more)
- we still vote in male dominated political systems, no harm to the patriarchy
- men can veto abortion regardless of whether they will look after the child or not (Tennessee)?
- we are forced to compete with men in size and strength favouring sports?

I have decided to no longer speak about equality, only social equity. This keeps focus on what I want for me, the current obstacles and progress towards a clear outcome. 

For example, being as free from threat of violence from social acquaintances as men are:  by not being alone with men other than my brothers or father, not accepting unnecessary attempts from men to engage me, not having male housemates, not having male friends (personal opinion), vetting any acquaintances hard and distancing myself from their circle at the earliest red flags, taking self defence class and using my skills. Etc.....
Men can do whatever it is they do without my attention. 

Focusing on what I want for myself also removes the blinkers put over my eyes like blinkers put on a workhorse - the role the patriarchy tries to assign to us. These are aimed at forcing it to only look in the direction it's wrangler drives it in and preventing it from seeing nearby threats which would cause it to act in self preservation.

One might ask why a woman should change her actions when the wrongdoing is men's. Unlike men, we don't have physical menace or a global system built to please us. The jailer won't give you the tools to tear down his own house.

I read somewhere that it would take a significant evolutionary change to make the world equitable for women. So I won't see it in my lifetime. I'm spurred on by the women in Korea and Japan rejecting marriage and childbirth if they don't want it. Also the senior women set on finally enjoying their time and turning down appeals from needy old men eager to live with them in order to be cared for. Also the smart young women calling out LVM.

I'm one to speak with my actions rather than words (except with trusted allies).

It brings me peace to have learned that I'm not simply lacking in skills to achieve what cleverer and richer and more cunning women have not, in this misogynist world. I don't need to be the voice that shouts loudest, crudest, longest or become skilled at lies and manipulation.
Simply living my life on the course I have set for myself, with the blinkers off, and supporting other women, is the entire point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lqlsbk/keeping_my_ship_on_course_equality_vs_social/,1614096136.0,104,0.94,3,FemaleDatingStrategy,justforfds

lqezbs,"Why you should never give a ""nice guy"" the slightest chance","When I was around 25 and been single for a couple of years, most people (including my own mother) told me I should lower my standards and gIvE a **NiCe GuY‚Ñ¢**  a ChAnCe. Apparently I was asking too much when I wanted a man to be on the same level as me on things such as income, life goals, education, etc. *""So what if they're not educated, they can still be wonderful husbands and parents! Maybe they appreciate marriage more than most modern men these days! And you should give a man with a child a chance, sometimes these things happen in life! You shouldn't concentrate so much on looks, you'll grow fond of him once you get to know him!""*

So I gave a nice guy a chance. He had a child, wasn't on the best terms with the baby mama but he claimed she was crazy and cheated on poor woe him. He had only started to study. He had very low income. He was seemingly obsessed with me. He didn't work out at all, but bragged about being a competition-level swimmer a few years back. He was introverted and shy. And this is what happened when I compromised my life because some scrote ""deserved a chance.""   
He cheated on me with the baby mama. She never cheated on him. He had cheated on her constantly as well. He constantly cheated on me with other women too.  
He studied a fancy profession to get admiration from women, and has ended up with a ton of student debt and out of job due to the pandemic. I found out he had taken endless quickie loans and credit card debt which he wasn't able to pay off. He borrowed thousands from me, and still owes me money.  
He was love bombing me from the start, and after a few months he showed his true manipulative, abusive psychopath colors. He called me with slurs all the time and blamed me for cheating, which I never did. He beat me often and blamed me for that. He broke my finger. He ripped out my hair. He threw me against our living room window and it broke. He broke my furniture, doors and door handles in my home, when I tried to escape by locking myself into another room. And of course, it was my fault anyway.  
His definition of quality time was to play WoW 18 hours straight.   
He jerked off to internet girls while I was gone and had an ED by the age of 24.  
He was introverted and shy because he had zero self esteem and he felt so below me he had to drag me down in order to feel better about himself. He blamed me for his terrible self esteem, but the truth is, a nice guy himself is like a bottomless well. You can pour all your love, caring and praise into it but it will never fill. They are like an empty vessel. All they have is hatred.

Lowering your standards, giving up your boundaries and giving someone ""a chance"" will compromise your mental and physical health and even your life. There is *always* a reason behind the nice guy's shortcomings. There is a reason why they can't eg. finish a school, land a normal job or why they have children that they can't take care of. There is a reason behind the shyness, in reality it's just the poor self esteem. They hate you for being better than them, the misogyny is unbelievable. I could have died in the hands of this ""nice guy"", and even then the tables would have turned and I would have been blamed for it in our society. *""Why didn't she leave earlier, she should have known better, women always go for the chads that just beat them up!""*

So never, NEVER give up even one standard. Never stretch even one boundary. It will only lead you to worse life. When you show them you can give them the benefit of the doubt, they will use it. Next time he will push you slightly too hard, and you might hit your head in the wrong angle on the floor and die.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lqezbs/why_you_should_never_give_a_nice_guy_the/,1614074926.0,236,0.97,11,FemaleDatingStrategy,helena939392

Anyways it‚Äôs like our second date and when he arrives he legit brought his baby raccoons in a cage (there were like 6?!) and asked if they could stay in my apartment while we go on the date.

But I felt too guilty to turn him away and I love animals so I didn‚Äôt want to leave them in the car lmao. So I put towels over their cage and left them in the closet to mask the noise and prayed to god my roommates didn‚Äôt come home. Honestly this may have been a plot of his to allow him in my room, idk, he never made advances, I guess he just really needed a place to put his raccoons.

lqbnqo,Pick me priorities,"Reposted because it got lost in the universe.

TL;DR My ""friend"" prioritises sleeping with scrotes she doesn't know over everything else in the middle of a pandemic and I'm over her. 

My friend lost her job due to the pandemic. That meant she also had to move back to her parent's and quit her dream of living in the city. I say quit because although it could have easily been an opportunity to gather strenght, improve and come back stronger... She is putting all her efforts in that not being the case.

A few months into the pandemic, while she still had a job, I started noticing that her behavior was... Not what I would expect.

She let me know she was on tinder, and slept with a complete stranger, in his place.

Then she met another guy, brought him to her place at 11PM to drink tea (I know) and the next day she would not shut up about ""How nice of him to take the time to come ALL THE WAY HERE"" (he lived 10 min away WALKING) followed by endless hours repeating she felt they had AN AMAZING CONNECTION. He showed up to her place bearing just the gift of his audacity and she was gushing about it as if it was a high honor. 

That was a Wednesday, they agreed on a date on Friday.

Friday comes and by the end of the day, around 21.00 she textes me, he stood her up. I told her to block and delete him and move on.

23.30 and she is forwarding me the voicemail this scrote just sent her, telling her straight that he chose to go drinking with his friends and chose to not even text her. That he was drunk and he knew it was unacceptable and that he would never accept to be treated like that. - word by word. Not even a feeble attempt at an apology or bothering to sound apologetic. 

I told her, again to quit entertaining this audacious piece of meat and block him already. 

Her reply??? I'M GOING TO PUNISH HIM BY USING HIM JUST FOR SEX.

The next week she asked me for money to go to work. I sent her the amount. The day after that, she told me she had an issue and needed money again because she couldn't get the public transport card... And I sent the money, again. 

A couple of weeks later talking with our mutual friend and with me, she had a lapse and told us she met this *sshole again, so I realized what happened with the money. She paid his dinner, then slept with him. 

Fast forward to now, she is staying at her parent's, they are both high risk. She is supposed to be preparing herself to get her driving license (we are in our 30s, this is looong overdue and she has lost many opportunities because of not having it) , but instead of that, how is she spending her time??? 

ON TINDER. 

She started talking with this scrote and wouldn't stop talking about him, but he lives in another area and due to COVID restrictions they couldn't met. 

She sent my other friend and me 7 screenshots of a horrid conversation between the two of them consisting of her sending him whole paragraphs basically telling him that whatever he wants to do with her it's cool, but to just let her know if he grows tired of her (I'm screaming inside as I type this) 

To which this scrote saw the opportunity and seized it to set the basis of what to expect and told her that he has hurt people before, that he is better now, but to not get upset if he stops texting her, because that's just him. 

And she was showing us that because she was AMAZED of how OPEN AND HONEST AND VULNERABLE HE WAS. 

My firend and I told her that he was letting her know exactly what he would do and yet... She said she doesn't see it that way and wants to see where ot goes. 

And he tested positive for covid, but that was ""many days ago"" 

So, finally tonight, she sends us a picture with the scrote. 

Restrictions have not been lifted so she is adding breaking the law to putting her parents in danger and putting having a man AT ALL COST before improving her life in any way. 

I replied, very angry as I still feel, that her choices are hers, as are the consequences, and I don't ever want to hear about her story with this guy again. 

She is one of my best friends but I have been seeing this behavior for months and I'm so appalled and angry by her selfish and reckless behavior in the middle of a f*cking pandemic that has taken thousands of lives that I don't think the friendship can survive. 

I hope nothing happens to her parents, because if it were to, she would not be taking any responsibility and would play the ""bad luck"" card.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lqbnqo/pick_me_priorities/,1614062700.0,100,0.96,12,FemaleDatingStrategy,mynameisrominka

lqaz6f,Self-reflection of a former pickmeisha,"I was curious today why I wasn‚Äôt upset about the guy I recently broke up with. On paper we had a good connection, lots of similarities, and had (what I thought was) good communication with each other. When I broke up with him I was upset that day not over him but that I felt I had failed once again and was SO exhausted with dating. So I decided to dive into the FDS handbook today and after looking at the glossary I realized that drive-by therapy is a thing and.... wow. 

In the past if a man confided in me about something personal I immediately thought they trusted me and that I was special because they chose to tell me something personal. That could be partly due to my own struggles to open up growing up so I value it so much when someone does. Coincidentally, every man who‚Äôs done that I‚Äôve always had a hard time getting over. 

My friends were so pumped about this guy I was dating as he seemed so open and honest. I always was skeptical, as he seemed like the ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù scenario and well obviously my gut was right about him. He truly was just mirroring me (note to self:  don‚Äôt share so much earlier on). 

I haven‚Äôt regretted my decision once. I don‚Äôt miss him at all. The fact I was frustrated that I wasn‚Äôt having breakup remorse kinda makes me laugh cause‚Äô it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm mourning my pick me behaviour. May she Rest In Peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lqaz6f/selfreflection_of_a_former_pickmeisha/,1614060331.0,67,0.95,2,FemaleDatingStrategy,dillybarrose
lqauyq,Debunking male reasoning &amp; Why casual sex is totally not worth it,"When I have discussions with guys on perspectives on dating and sex, they often use very similar lines of reasoning to try to convince me why casual sex in the form of hookups/FWBs/fuck buddies is ‚Äúnot a bad thing‚Äù and why guys should not be chastised for wanting it.

I‚Äôm writing this to debunk those beliefs to myself, why it is not worthwhile, quoting these guys‚Äô own reasoning. When I was younger in college and heard these words, I felt confused, swayed, and very unsure about my self-value and personal beliefs. ""Maybe guys have their own reasoning. But why do I still feel so uncomfortable and unsettled?"" It took me lots of time spent following FDS to re-educate myself. I've been in FDS for a while now, but I think it's still important to reiterate in bullet points.

The debunking in this post is NOT meant to be used to argue with scrotes. Never try to argue with them. You block and delete them the moment they spurt out these lines. This post is meant to be a reminder to rewire your thinking for your own well-being.

Personally, casual encounters have never cut it for me. I've always wanted stable, healthy, and respectful commitment, as well as the sex and emotional connection that comes with it. So I'm writing this from that perspective.

***1.‚ÄúI can find a girl attractive and interesting and want to sleep with her. I don‚Äôt necessarily need or want feelings and commitment with her.‚Äù*** Well, of course, it‚Äôs a sweet deal to you because you pay $1 and get a deal worth $100. Wow why are you so smart my scrote! You are benefiting from her physical looks, sex, conversations, company, time, and effort while you don‚Äôt have to give anything in return.

**‚Üí FDS Moral of the story: Stay away from this. He blatantly claims that you will not get a full package from him and you are  ""cool enough to fuck"" but that's about it.** When you get involved, it's very detrimental to your sanity once you've internalized self-blaming, such as ""Why am I not good enough? Is it my fault that I'm not seen as date material?"", which can take years to unlearn. Especially dangerous when you are young and don't have much life experience nor a solid sense of judgment yet in order to distinguish between which is acceptable treatment from the other sex and which is not.

Between Guy A who gives you respectful attention &amp; shared interests &amp; feelings &amp; dedicated sex &amp; nice paid dinners at proper restaurants &amp; beautiful holidays &amp; family meetings &amp; a ring,

and Guy B who gives you worthless flirty remarks &amp; bantering fluff &amp; cheap takeout pizza at 2 am &amp; no Uber ride home after dry sex where he refused to go down on you,

which one would you pick?

***2. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a confusing place in life and I‚Äôm not mentally ready for a relationship. It‚Äôs just my circumstances.‚Äù*** \- A lot of the times it‚Äôs just a bullshit excuse to blame on ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù. It‚Äôs your own issue for lacking the emotional maturity, self-responsibility, financial stability, career, life direction, or whatever that prevents you from wanting commitment. If only pumping and dumping someone also required as much ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù! Stop using it as an excuse to guilt-trip a person, especially someone who wants a relationship, into casual sex like you.

**‚Üí Spend your time on cultivating what you love doing in your own life, not some scrote's life. You are a capable woman, in control of your own looks, career, hobbies, standards, and dreams.** Don‚Äôt try to be a Barbara the Builder to help the guy get out of that ‚Äúconfusing place in life‚Äù. Even if you manage to rope him into having a relationship with you, he won't give it 100%. Why settle when you can improve yourself and get a much better deal elsewhere? Either get a full package guy that has no issue expressing and acting that he wants to be with you and makes you really happy, or say ‚ÄúNah fuck off. I can do much better than this‚Äù.

***3. ‚ÄúCasual sex is fun for both sides. Girls want it too. Wanting casual sex does not make someone a worse person.""*** \- You don‚Äôt give anything worthwhile aside from a community dick. Girls who want it tend to be pickmeishas who bend over backward, have a thirst for male attention, or are just lonely and deprived of quality romantic and/or platonic relationships in life. They accept bad and unsatisfying sex where they can‚Äôt even get off because they don‚Äôt know what the real deal (loving sex + emotional assurance) looks like.

**‚Üí  Ask yourself if the half-assed sex and the crappy hot-and-cold treatment you‚Äôve got has EVER been worth it.** For me personally, it's empty, degrading, hurtful, and disheartening. Recall the difference when you had great sex and a meaningful connection. If you haven‚Äôt had any meaningful encounter in your life, it might be a little hard to imagine, but take my word for it that sex with LVMs will destroy your self-esteem and leave you at a lower place than before.

***4. ‚ÄúNot all girls are quality and have 100 great suitors waiting for them. Do they deserve a relationship themselves?‚Äù*** \- Whether a girl is flawed or not is not your business. Who the heck do you think you are to shame her? Preying on her bad past experiences, personal flaws, lack of good dating options in her city, etc. reflects how depraved you are, scrote. Even if a girl is flawed, it doesn‚Äôt automatically qualify her as a fleshlight at your beck and call that bows down to your first ""u up"" text and half-assed sex.

**‚Üí Do not ever entertain LVMs, even when you think you haven‚Äôt mastered your goal of becoming a queen yet.** They will pull you down to their level. You might think even just casual texting or hanging out with no expectations with them doesn‚Äôt hurt. But the ramifications of this behavior on you are subtle. It will subconsciously trip you into thinking that HVMs really don‚Äôt exist and you gotta settle with LVMs.

**ETA:**

***5. ""Come on, we are 2 adults who are attracted to each other. What's wrong with my desire to be intimate with you by all means?""*** \- Very common trap. No, we are not 2 equally in power adults. I am a woman and casual sex harms me more. I am more susceptible to STDs. I can get pregnant even though we use protection. Chances are never 0. If my photos/videos are taken during sex, nothing happens to men but I am at the edge of the cliff. I can face isolation, trauma, and victim shame and my life can turn upside down just because I trusted the wrong person and slept with him. My future really depends on how well I protect my womb. I may get pregnant and want to keep the baby because of hormones or my own decision at that moment, but you haven't proved yourself to be a good father. I may be chained to you for the rest of my life because we are co-parenting. Also, my hormones will go crazy after sex and I will start getting attached and emotional. This will make me blindly fall for you without enough vetting. I haven't even mentioned possible rape attempts and sexual assaults during being intimate. For example, you may force me to have anal sex even though I said no. (from u/secularwitch)

**‚Üí Educate yourself on how much casual sex can put your health, emotions, and future at risk.** I would like to add more on the consequences of unrequited feelings to LVMs. Investing in men who have not been vetted carefully can take a heavy toll on your well-being from so many hours of crying to your girlfriends, posting dead-end questions on relationship subs, and wondering why he can just dispose of you like trash after physical intimacy. It robs you of hours and hours from your life, your mental peace, your self-esteem, and confidence. His desire is ""wrong"" because he is using you, plain and simple.

***6. ""We've been going on 3/ 5/ 10/ X dates (or spent time for quite a while together) already. It's just natural that we proceed to the next step of getting a bit more intimate, you know?""*** \- Classic example of the sublime male logic: Women are vending machines where I put coins in and sex will fall out. I have bought you 3 dinners so it‚Äôs time for me to reap my returns. Good job scrote for trying to play into the people-pleasing mentality that women have been brainwashed into since forever.

**‚Üí Always continue to vet men throughout the dating process. Stick to the 90 days rule of FDS before putting out sex too early.** They haven't earned your trust yet. Do not feel indebted to them. You play by your own rules, not some arbitrary timeline a dude sets to pressure you.

Do not immediately assume commitment after an X number of dates and tie yourself down to him. Until he spells out the suggestion of going exclusive, you are only casually dating and **this also counts as casual sex**. LVMs would say that they treat a girl with the same respect even if they have sex early, but if it were the case degrading slurs like ‚Äúsluts‚Äù who are ‚Äúeasy and free‚Äù would not exist.

***7. ""It's honestly no big deal if a girl decides she wants sex on a first date. It doesn't change how I view her and my respect to her. Couples who hooked up on the first date exist.""*** \- If I don't have sex with you on the very first date, then I must be using you for a free meal, but if I've slept with more than 5 guys, I'm a sl\*t. So which is it, scrotes? Am I supposed to sleep with every guy that spends a dime on me, or do you want women with minimal previous partners?  (from u/relationship_reddit)

**‚Üí Same lesson as #6.** **Don't be impatient and jump ahead in the process regardless of how attracted you are to a man.** Scrotes can totally lie to you and say that they ""don't respect you less"" even after sex, but think about that dirty feeling and awkward air the next morning. They don't respect you, and you also lose respect for yourself and you will continue to feel humiliated and blame yourself the whole way home. No more. The odds of a guy turning HVM just because you offer sex are very slim. How many healthy relationships were born from cheap hookups in reality?

lqaupj,"Sex Advice Scammers: Nadia Bokody - Borderline Personality Disorder, Self Harm, Abusive Behavior, and Zero educational background apparently qualifies one as a ""Sexpert""","Nadia Bokody - bills herself as a ""Columnist, sex positive feminist, Sexpert and mental health advocate"" - she's written more than 250 articles for major media, including The Washington Post, Huffpost, Cosmo, News.com.au:

https://muckrack.com/nadia-bokody

She's been criticized on FDS for pushing a pro-porn agenda via her columns:

https://old.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/kgrbwm/sex_pozzy_columnist_nadia_bokody_defends_pornhub/

Nadia Bokody was a struggling journalist who finally broke into mainstream in April 2018 by claiming to be a sex addict and bragging about fucking a married colleague:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5633047/Self-confessed-sex-addict-Nadia-Bokody-says-doesnt-regret-hooking-married-colleague.html

She wrote an article for mamamia describing having a complete meltdown in front of her colleagues after being rejected by a work colleague she was having sex with:

https://www.mamamia.com.au/crying-in-front-of-colleagues/

In October 2018, she wrote a viral article for SheSaid where she detailis having 7 one night stands with strangers in 7 days after her divorce, in which she describes repeatedly crying, but also says left her with a ""feeling of empowerment"":

https://shesaid.com/7-one-night-stands-in-7-days/

In 2019, she confessed she made the whole sex addict thing up, and said that ""sex addiction is not a real thing"". 

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7465005/Sex-addict-Nadia-Bokody-says-condition-not-real-regrets-15-minutes-fame.html

So Nadia is not a sex addict by definition, but what *does* Nadia have? Severe Borderline Personality disorder! So much so, she had to be involuntarily hospitalized in a psych ward in 2019, which she confesses is not her first time:

https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/womens-health/what-living-with-borderline-personality-disorder-feels-like/news-story/2d082d8952c84c3c0d6fe6c3bb18cb50 

Here she admits that her BPD caused her to be very abusive to her partners with increasingly escalating emotiional abuse including getting into screaming matches, self harming as punishment and throwing things at her partners:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YoH9690fQ

So it appears that Nadia's ""empowering"" sexcapades and inability to deal with the emotional fallout of her relationships, might actually be just compulsive sex and self harm, a symptom of BPD. And the ""empowerment"" she felt having one night stands was short lived, as the rejection from these men triggered many of her emotional dysregulation and abandonment fears typical of those with BPD. 


While there is surely a place in media for people from different walks of life to discuss their experiences and growth, why is she being sought after as ""Sexpert"" columnist? 


For the record, ""Sexpert"" and ""Mental Health Advocate"" are meaningless terms. There are absolutely no qualifications required to call yourself either of these terms except the willingness to overshare on the internet. 


Why are people who suffer from understanding appropriate boundaries and have emotional dysregulation issues being asked to write relationship and sex articles as experts for women? Especially those with ZERO medical or therepeutic background?

I see this type of criticism ALL. THE. DAMN. TIME. particularly in lefty circles.

And it always makes me CACKLE at the thought that men suddenly aren't okay with body shaming the moment it starts to affect *them!*

Oh so you think it's wrong to categorize someone's worth based on their looks? Yeah sure, tell that to the dudes who rate women on a scale of 1-10.

Men have been body shaming women and have been placing our worth on how ""fuckable"" we are since time immemorial. 

Then as soon as a bunch of women start to fight back and create the body positivity movement, all the smelly neckbeards crawl out of the woodwork to hijack that concept and twist it to suit their own selfish narratives.

If we banned things for ""body shaming"" then literally almost all forms of popular media would cease to exist. Porn, instragram, fashion, Hollywood, music videos, etc. all inherently promote some form of body shaming *towards women.*

Just goes to show that men are so mentally fragile that they cannot tolerate even a tiny fraction of the constant BULLSHIT that women are forced to tolerate 24/7.

Body shaming is bad, sure. But if you only oppose body shaming when men are the targets, yet participate when it's directed at women, then it's not body shaming you have a problem with.

lgzuoh,What is a HVM?,"Let‚Äôs clear this up, lurkers. 

High value men are not based on how tall they are, or how much money they make. Every woman has their preferences just like men have preferences (totally fine with it btw) But what makes a man high value is based on his morality.  

And before you guys start up with the not all men BS, just ü§öüèª 

Lie: High value men are 6 tall, or make lots of money.  

Truth: A high value man is valued because he is a GOOD MAN that loves and treats his partner with respect. 

Men say this lie because they can excuse being lazy and say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm not 6 tall or a millionaire‚Äù. Instead of just being a good man which isn‚Äôt hard! 

Let‚Äôs debunk the lie and why it‚Äôs total BS now. 
1. What good is a man with a million dollars to me if he doesn‚Äôt share it with me? I‚Äôd much rather have a poor man that is generous with what little he has. 
2. What good is a tall man to me if he uses his looks to play the field? I‚Äôd rather have a short man that is faithful. 

The reason many women PREFER being single (which is a good chunk of this group) is because of men‚Äôs attitudes towards women and the way they treat us on dates and in relationships. Why be in a relationship with a man when we derive absolutely no benefit from it??? When a man is just taking value from our lives and not giving back, that is a LOW VALUE MAN. 

Women deserve better than shitty low value men. They deserve respect, they deserve love, they deserve loyalty, they deserve a partner in life. If they don‚Äôt find a man like this they have a community of sisters that support them so they can be single and thrive alone. It is far better to be alone then with bad company thank you very much gents. 

Now, a high value man, is a man that will support a woman and help her grow. A high value man doesn‚Äôt hate women. A high value man does not cheat. He doesn‚Äôt abuse porn and drugs. He can cook and clean, take care of his physical and mental health, go to work, and pay bills. He doesn‚Äôt expect or demand her to do degrading things in bed even if she doesn‚Äôt want to. He doesn‚Äôt spend thousands on himself and balk at an engagement ring because oh it‚Äôs too expensive. You can call it a simp if you want to, because every guy that says the word ‚Äúsimp‚Äù is a red neon flag to women ‚ÄúDONT DATE ME, IM A SELFISH ASSHOLE‚Äù

This is the basic requirement for being high value. Height and financial status is dependent on individuals and everyone is different. 

These things I‚Äôve listed everyone can do. If you aren‚Äôt meeting this you are not high value and you should work on yourself by seeing a therapist.

lclzio,Misogynistic Reaction to Women Screaming/Yelling,"There is something that I've noticed over the past few years that I'm trying to figure out and that's the negative reaction from men when women are loud or scream (out of distress or anger). 

Two examples. 

One: I've been watching self defense videos on Youtube from a certified instructor who focuses on live video from dash cams, body cams and other captured film footage. And of course because I'm a masochist, I read some of the comments. 

*Without fail* every single time there is a woman featured in a video and particularly when she's screaming out of distress the comments EXPLODE with misogynistic remarks. Every comment is something like 'wHy iS sHe ScReAmInG???' and 'stupid WIMMMINS always freaking out over stupid shit' (one video was a police officer shooting a woman's brother in front of her when he pulled a gun) and generally just solid misogynistic shit. 

Two: for a few years I worked for an art gallery that was located inside a government building. On reception nights I would hang out with the security guard who was on that shift and got to know him quite well.  

One night he tells me this story of when he worked at a prison one of the inmates committed suicide and it was a messy one. His female partner walked in on the horror scene and freaked out and screamed and screamed. He turns to me and asks ME 'why did she scream?'

And I'm staring at him like '.... really?' maybe because it was horrifying and traumatizing? Turns out this dude was an absolute piece of shit but that story stuck with me. Not the inmate killing himself but HIS reaction to his female partner screaming, like it was weird for her to be upset or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT IS THIS? What is this bizarre contempt towards women who react vocally to horrific events? Is it because men don't see women as human and are surprised when they react like a human? Is it the stupid stoicism thing, where he who reacts less wins? Just another facet of misogyny, I guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lclzio/misogynistic_reaction_to_women_screamingyelling/,1612462414.0,262,0.95,39,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted]

lcj1fk,This is what a real man is about,"My father had a PhD, always had a job, no matter what, treated my mother like a Queen. Bought her beautiful flowers every week (from a florist, ones he knew she liked), beautiful jewellery and shopping sprees to her heart's desire (sometimes beyond credit limits but he handled that!). He worshipped her and fulfilled whatever she wanted, I.e. Holidays, homewares, anything. Our income was middle class but it felt upper class because the man/breadwinner funnelled all of it to us...not hookers, gambling, drinking or the other LVM weaknesses.
From the age of 10, he gave me Valentine's chocolates and always bolstered my self-esteem. I hit puberty early and I was very nerdy so he had his work cut out, but he made me feel like a goddess. I kept my virginity until my ex husband (rich handsome guy so seemingly HVM). I'm grateful I didn't just give it up to all the gross losers that I encountered...there were so many skeezebags who tried to force it on me and I just said nooo. So, he helped me see my worth...so important.
When I had female friends over, he'd be lighting cigarettes and getting drinks. He listened and was kind. He scared off any crappy boys, for me or my girls. We needed it. Our filters sucked...we were 90s girls lol.
Anyway...now I'm 40 and sadly Dad passed 8 years ago but I'm trying to re-apply his expectations. Yes, men should treat women differently. No going Dutch or being a sport about stupid shit.

lcd2g9,‚ÄúShe is 18 ‚Äòlegal‚Äô so I‚Äôm not a pedophile.‚Äù Way of thinking needs to stop!!,"We see it everywhere: for example the billie ellish interview. 

‚ÄúShe is finally 18!‚Äù
‚ÄúShe is legal know!‚Äù
‚ÄúLet the countdown begin!‚Äù 

**It‚Äôs disgusting** 


I find it so weird that the minute a girl turns 18 (mostly men think) she is for ‚Äògrabs‚Äô... your still a predotor/pedophile if your into 18-20 olds when your over a certain age (say 30 and older) her being ‚Äòlegal‚Äô does not change that! Or large age gap in general. 


I can't understand how you can think when you've reached a certain age that you think 17 and 18 is a big difference. ‚ÄúOh she's 17 it's not allowed!‚Äù but ‚ÄúOh she's 18 now it's legal!‚Äù

This makes me wonder if they really think 17 and 18 year olds really act so different, the answer is NO. Of course I have grown between the ages of 17 and 18 as a person, but not significantly. Not in contrast to say 15 and 20 or 20 and 25

These are the same people that would date a 16 year old or even younger if it were legal, arguing ""But it's legal.""

Prime example for this behavior is Leonardo Dicaprio, he is 46 and Camilla is 23. She wasn't even born when he was 18 .. Yikes! But all is forgiven because she is 23 , and ‚Äòlegal' ..

I‚Äôm not saying that i‚Äôm against it later in life, for example 55 and 40.

BUT

If the age gap is that big, we all now what kind of person (mostly man) we're dealing with!

It is not YOUR fault you were demeaned
It is not YOUR fault you were disrespected
It is not YOUR fault you feel unlovable 
It is not YOUR fault you still go through the memories in your head and blame yourself.

FDS has helped me realize it's good to remember in order to HEAL, it's meant to learn and get stronger. I know it may not feel like that right now, but just know you are worthy of so much more. Always be sure to heal yourself and know that no one can give you the kind of peace you can find within yourself. Love is company and compassion, and if that is what you're searching for, always be able to heal first and not delve into anything with old mentalities or blame yourself for what happened to you.

Before you founds FDS, maybe you had some things that hurt you and you feel you could have totally avoided those situations, but i'm here to tell you it is NOT your fault. You did the best you could do in your circumstances and what mindset and morals were taught to you. It is up to you now to deprogram everything that will hurt you and learn from the hurt.

lc66kq,Chris from MAFS is the perfect example of an LVM,"I like to watch trashy reality TV to escape the stress of actual reality and Married at First Sight is one of my favorite trainwrecks.  


Chris from this current season is the perfect example of an LVM. All he talks about is how successful he is. He wants a submissive, traditional wife who's a ""freak in the sheets"". Expects to have 7 kids. Talked about a honeymoon baby on the day of the wedding before even meeting his soon-to-be-wife. Talked mad trash about her after the wedding to her bridesmaids. And then slept with her twice before disappearing and apparently having a panic attack because he isn't attracted to her.  


THEN, instead of apologizing to her, he shifts the blame on her and how upset she made him for discussing his fuck boy antics with his parents. Later the same day, just when you think he may have just a little bit of regret about how he acted, he turns the ""apology"" into hyping himself up and trying to make his new wife believe just how awesome he is. Classic abuser behavior. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  


This season could literally be a case study on how LVM fake being HVM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lc66kq/chris_from_mafs_is_the_perfect_example_of_an_lvm/,1612408635.0,92,0.93,25,FemaleDatingStrategy,likejackandsally
lc5ogw,The REAL reason men are on dating sites often isn't to find a date.,"This is something I think is lost on a lot of women here. We'll scoff at their low-effort profiles, cheese one-liners, and think ""how would THAT get them laid?""

But here's the thing: a lot of men aren't on OLD to find a date. They're not even on there to hook up. Sure, they'd like all of those things, but there's something more addicting and freely available on Tinder than the promise of sex.

And that's a woman's time and attention. They'll deny it, scream it isn't true until their faces turn purple. They regularly argue that they shouldn't have to pay on dates when a woman only gives her time, then jump on Tinder for their microdoses of a woman's attention. That's why so many of the posts on dating app subs are screenshots of cheesy one-liners and dudes patting each other on the back. They want a woman's attention, good or bad. A date is just a byproduct.

Why is it important to know this? To emphasize the importance of your attention. It's so valuable to men that they'll go to great lengths to get it from you even when they know you aren't interested. It's why ""nice guys"" suddenly turn into assholes and mock you for telling them off. It's why guys insist on knowing WHY you reject them, so they can talk to you some more. It's not about getting a date with you, they know they don't measure up to your standards. But if they can draw out an interaction with you for as long as possible, that's good enough for them.

It's also why guys like to keep orbiters around. Any ex or former fwb that hasn't completely disappeared from his life is a potential validation fix. Hence the late-night ""hey"" texts and ""just thinking of you"" emails. They don't want to fix things, they don't want to try again. Sure, they'll be open to the possibility of you chasing them again, but they're not holding their breath.

It's also why guys in relationships jump on dating apps. Again, getting some side action would be nice. But ultimately Tinder serves as a guaranteed attention fix for them with minimal possibility of getting caught with their literal pants down. (Side note, here's another reason why you should drop guys who don't ask you out in a timely fashion.)

And finally, it's why my inbox will get at least one angry message from a guy after reading this post. Hi, boys.

So the next time a guy you haven't met goes to great lengths to piss you off, annoy you, or otherwise leave you compelled to respond, do it with the block button. They're just trying to push your buttons to validate their own existence. They live for your attention, even if it's negative. ESPECIALLY if it's negative.

Ladies, value your time more than they do. No more explanations, paragraphs, insults, or comebacks. Block and delete.

lc2ih9,My journey w/ FDS that might be useful for women lurking here (idk if irrelevant but),"I've decided to write this post in order to share my experience with FDS, and how my outlook/perception of the sub has changed + the things it taught me. I hope that if there are women uncertain about the things this sub teaches / disagreeing with the advice given here, this post will be of help :)

I don't remember how I first came across FDS or when, but I believe it was around July 2020. At first iirc I was a bit shocked and thought women here were just really entitled, honestly. I didn't agree with it at all. I also can't say I remember what made me stay, instead of thinking ""crazy, entitled women, moving on"", but I think I liked that men weren't allowed to comment and that this sub was entirely about women? Reddit is full of men commenting everywhere their sexist self-centered opinions that no woman asked for, and it's a relief to have a place where that does not happen.

Things that didn't make sense to me *really started to make sense*. The questions I had were all answered. I was able to see things for what they are, as opposed to how I wanted them to be or the way my empathy skewed my perception of events. 

I dislike talking about this topic because it makes me feel embarassed, but I believe it's relevant to the post - at the time, when I found out about FDS, I was still pining after a guy I used to talk to through texts and phone calls. I definitely used to consider it a relationship, an ""online relationship"", but now I see that there's no such thing. Either way, *so much* started to make sense to me.

He was physically unattractive, overweight, had poor hygiene, etc. I'm conventionally attractive. And *I liked him first*. So why did he still treat me so badly? FDS answered that question and MANY other questions I had as well regarding the entire situation. 

*why was he much more into a girl who didn't give a fuck about him?*

*why didn't he appreciate my looong paragraphs telling him I loved him?* (ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢)

It was like a magic light switched. If it wasn't for FDS I wouldn't have understood why he did things. As women, we're very very easy prey for men because all dating advice comes from them. Ask a guy out! Chase him! Make the first move! cOmMuNicAtE! It's ok if he likes other women's pics because he chose you!!! Men can't read your mind, tell him what you want!

And so on and so forth. The list is endless. And all of those things are a LIE which I was uncapable of seeing.

I was not physically attracted to him. But I forced myself to stay. Honestly, to anyone else, I'm just dumb, because he truly did not have any redeeming qualities. But I was 16, with poor self esteem and very dependent on others, lacked social skills, etc. He obviously took advantage of that 

There are grown women who are still stuck in relationships w/ men with the worst behavior, men they're not attracted to, men who lie, cheat, put in no effort, etc.

There are so many posts that cover this that Im afraid of being repetitive, but if you're a woman who is unsure about FDS, I was too. For me it was easier because all of my beliefs regarding political stuff were already aligned with this sub, but the ""he has to pay!!!"" ""he has to chase you!!!"" stuff put me off at first. I thought it was conservative and retrograde.

But it's not. Exceptions do exist and this sub isn't a cult. There's always room for debate, disagreement and, yes, exceptions. But there is no compromise of self respect. Those compromises will cost you your sanity. There is no compromise on how you deserve to be treated.

I think I resisted FDS because I didn't want to accept how things actually were. I refused to accept all my efforts were for nothing, that they were never respected from the beggining. But once I did accept it I was finally free, from my own judgement too: thinking I was the problem, that there was something wrong w/ me when there NEVER was.

A man who wants you will demonstrate it. He WILL. You are worth that 30$ meal.

Something I read on askmen a long time ago:

""If men haven't made the first move it's because they're not interested"". 

No matter how progressive *your* views are, that's not men. Men don't care about how independent you are by making you pay that meal. They either care for you or they don't. If they don't, well... you know.

My advice is: read. Analyze situations you've been in / situations you're at. Read more. There ARE answers to your questions. The WHY doesn't he care???? WHY does he do x or y or z to me?? There ARE answers. Ask yourself: is this what I want to put up with? Realize disrespect grows as much as you allow it to happen. Think of how happy you'd be if you were with a man who truly put in the effort to be with you. A man who undoubtedly wants you. Think of whether you want flowers and chocolate for Valentine's Day or ""this day is stupid anyways"". If you are someone who brings shit to the table you deserve the same from your partner.


Don't let you guard down. Work on your self love and independence. Realize life does not start and end with a boyfriend, that loving someone who hurts you is a lack of self respect.

I'm terrified of building a career, potential boyfriends finding out, friends, schools, etc. I know this is something I will likely have to live with for the rest of my life.

I've deleted all accounts, I'm in the process of changing my appearance, I'm working to hire a company that will scrub my content from the internet (as much as it can be done anyways, there is stuff that I just can't have removed/have control over) and I have an appointment with a therapist next week.  I can't change what's happened, but I am looking for any tips, advice, whatever you have to offer to move on emotionally, mentally, career-wise, romantically, etc. I really respect you guys and I hope to be able to put this in the past as much as I am able to.

lbuqrl,STOP PLAYING HOUSE,"I have to get this off my chest, because I see post after post in other subs of women who are combining finances and buying houses with boyfriends of 5+ years and it makes me want to SCREAM. 

Please, please, please, don't combine finances with someone you're not married to. FDS already discourages doing this (and cohabitation); but I see women (SMART women too!) buying houses with boyfriends left and right. Playing house is probably the single biggest mistake women make in LTR's prior to marriage and it tends to cost them greatly. Until you are married, (not engaged, married) the law does not protect you. You might as well have opened a bank account with the kind barista that makes you coffee every morning. If he decides to break up with you, drain the account, and peace out, you're SOL because he's legally entitled to do that. If you buy a house together you run the risk of him (1) dying and now you own a house with his parents because girlfriends don't inherit jack (2) refusing to sell or take your name off the mortgage after a breakup and now the court has to get involved (good luck) (3) stopping payment on the mortgage and now you're foreclosed on with no equitable distribution to help you get the money back somehow, or (4) he doesn't pay his bills and now you own a house with his creditors because unmarried people can't be joint tenants by the entirety (only title that could protect you from that). There's a bunch of other possibilities and nuances here, but it all boils down to one thing: marriage is not ""just a piece of paper,"" it provides a lot of protection and legal avenues for recourse in the event of separation. And if you're thinking, ""he wouldn't do that"", well... he hasn't married you yet, so how do you know he's staying long term? His foot's out the door, because THAT'S WHAT DATING IS FOR. The whole point of dating is to get to know someone and have time to decide if they're marriage material; ergo, if you're dating... he doesn't know if he wants to marry you yet and neither do you.

I know plenty of women who are still recuperating financially YEARS after a breakup because they never thought their partner would hang them out to dry like that. Spoiler alert, if he wouldn't marry you, he most likely would. You can love your partner and protect yourself at the same time, doesn't have to be one or the other. And if he's eager for marriage benefits like financial stability and health insurance he can pony up a ring. No marriage benefits until marriage.

lbt1ne,I dreamed in FDS,"FDS newbie here! I‚Äôve been devouring the FDS handbook and posts for the past few months, after I (embarrassing story time) drove to a LVM‚Äôs house during a pandemic, was greeted by his mom, and proceeded to have a literal play date. We‚Äôre 20. After which *he* started to breadcrumb *me* and I still found myself desperately waiting for a text back. Like I said, embarrassing.

My self esteem was at an all-time low but by some gift of God I stumbled across FDS that very week and haven‚Äôt looked back. I‚Äôve done my best to follow the handbook to a T, deleting every LVM man from my life and distancing myself from pickme friends. I‚Äôm still working on forgiving myself for my own pickme/cool girl past- I still cringe every time I think back- but I know it will come with time.

My latest big milestone to report is that last night I literally DREAMED in FDS. In my dream I was at college sitting with my friends when a very attractive mutual friend walked up to me. He started flirting before trying to kiss me and saying ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in love with me‚Äù. In my dream I cringed and thought to myself: he‚Äôs negging me right now!! I was torn and started to lean towards away when he asked ‚Äúwanna go somewhere to make out‚Äù (dorky I know haha, dream!). At that moment I thought to myself ‚Äúwhat does FDS say‚Äù and told him: ‚Äúif you want to get to know me, ask me out on a date and i‚Äôll consider it.‚Äù and walked away. 

I don‚Äôt remember how the dream ended but I remember feeling like I didn‚Äôt care. I woke up feeling AMAZING, even though it was a dream! I‚Äôm starting to literally practice FDS in my subconscious thoughts and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Thank you FDS!‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lbt1ne/i_dreamed_in_fds/,1612373718.0,117,0.98,3,FemaleDatingStrategy,Resident-Equipment95

lbd3fo,fear of being the bad guy,"I had a realization in the last few days that I have had a program running in the back of my head that has stopped me from being able to live my life fully. It‚Äôs one that was downloaded into me from birth through society, family, friendships and community:

‚ÄúBe a good girl.‚Äù

To my family, being a good girl meant shutting up, being small and putting myself last to take care of all of the people around me - including myself. Since birth. 

To my friends being a good girl meant letting them hookup with my ex, or letting them yell at me because they have ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù, or being neglected because I‚Äôm ‚Äústrong‚Äù and ‚Äúfine‚Äù while they were given the space to be vulnerable and lean on me.

To my community being a good girl meant wearing modest clothing, letting the elders of the community speak rudely to me and control what I do, never having ambition, never learning life skills or getting a good education. Staying in (their) control at all times.

How did **I** end up defining a good girl? To me a good girl was the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù, she does what others wants, let‚Äôs them neglect and abuse her, never thinks of herself, she is furniture to accentuate the lives of the people around her - and worth nothing more.

And to me, a bad person was someone who cares about themselves first, is selfish, rude, abusive, etc.

I‚Äôve struggled a lot on this journey of finding FDS, finding myself, making myself a priority, setting boundaries and having standards. 

If I care about myself, make myself a priority, **am I a bad person**? Am I a bad person for doing the things that I previously condemned in others? Does being a bad person mean I don‚Äôt deserve anything good in my life?

This is what society, your family, your friends, your community wants you to think. That because the people around you are all so bad, so selfish, that if you‚Äôre now on this journey through FDS, you must be a bad person for raising your standards and putting yourself first like them. That we‚Äôre just as bad as all the abusive, LV, NV people we‚Äôve been surrounded by our entire lives, right?

**No.** I‚Äôve since come to this apt conclusion:

*There are no bad people or good people.* 

There are people who when they make mistakes, they take 0 responsibility, sometimes don‚Äôt even acknowledge it and they simply refuse to learn from it. We know them well.

Then.. there are people who, when they make mistakes, they *learn from them, grow from them and hold themselves accountable.*

That‚Äôs the *only* standard that we need to be holding ourselves and others to when it comes to the black/white thinking of good guy vs bad guy.

You are not a bad person for putting yourself first, setting boundaries, having standards. You are not a good person for sacrificing yourself for others. They are not bad people for being selfish. They aren‚Äôt good people for ‚Äúputting up with you‚Äù. It‚Äôs never been about good vs bad.

Reframe. It‚Äôs about how we respond to life, to conflict, to our mistakes. Do we run from ourselves, from growth, or do we run towards (even begrudgingly)? Do we make the choice to better ourselves, however small a choice, or stay ignorant and stagnant? Do we do the hard but right thing? Or do we do the easy but worse?

Apply that to every situation in your life, every relationship you have. Does your boss, your employer, take accountability? What about your parents? Your best friends? Your *date*? 

If not, remember this does not make them a bad person and you a good one. Alternatively, you deciding to walk away from that job or friend does not make you a bad person and them the victim of your evil. It simply means that you are growing and they are not. Let them learn and grow on their own time, while you focus on you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/lbd3fo/fear_of_being_the_bad_guy/,1612318616.0,132,0.95,13,FemaleDatingStrategy,BabyGothQ

lb5v1o,On Ethical Self-Preservation: is it okay to fundamentally distrust men?,"FDS has awakened me to the reality that most men are LV.  I do not want to be taken advantage of by them, which requires me to enter interactions with them with a hefty dose of skepticism and keep my guard up.  But I am a spiritual person, and my religion teaches me to treat others as I would want to be treated, to remember that every human being is a beloved child of God.  These seem like irreconcilable stances.

Let's acknowledge up front that religion has always been one of the most potent weapons of the patriarchy, and many a woman has suffered years of abuse while being told to ""turn the other cheek.""  That being said, I'm not going to give up a core faith commitment of mine that all human beings are worthy and beloved just because so many of these men behave like trash.

I think where I land with this is having to separate the *person* from the *behavior,* and having to separate how I relate to a male human into how I relate to him as a *human being* vs. how I relate to him as a *man.*  As a human being, I see any and every man as beloved of God and with the potential to grow as a human being if he would have the humility to be influenced in a positive way.  But as a *man*, by which I mean ""someone living within the construct of male identity in this society,"" I do not trust him for one minute until he proves himself, and my expectation is that he will behave abominably.  As a *person* I may owe him the sort of disinterested, well-boundaried care that I owe any fellow human, but as a *woman* I owe him *nothing.*  I need the realism and self-care (self-defense, even) that our justified anger gives us, but I refuse to let NVM make me degenerate into a spiritually bankrupt and joyless cynicism.  It's sticky.

Idk, I'm still struggling with this and can't decide if it's a helpful framework or an unhealthy compartmentalization.

I deleted my OLD profiles, blocked and deleted toxic people from my life, wrote out my boundaries and reflected on what I truly wanted for myself.

I excelled at my job and was given executive responsibility, transformed my room into a place that makes me genuinely happy and calm, started learning new things, created healthy new habits that I enjoy.

And now just over the weekend, I've been offered a dream opportunity doing really important work that aligns with my values and is really just a huge step in my life and career.

lak0ma,The Peter Pan ‚Äúmomma‚Äôs boy‚Äù is a Narcissist too,"Hey ladies! Your resident narc-magnet here sharing some insight I‚Äôve been working on . I‚Äôm convinced that all of us have at one time found ourselves dealing with a narcissist male. Whether overt (grandiose) or covert (closet/vulnerable), with the tactics of love bombing, gaslighting, projection and the works remain relatively stable to understand. 

But I‚Äôve found the Peter Pan ""momma‚Äôs boy"" may not fit the description of a ‚Äòtypical narcissist‚Äô. There isn‚Äôt clear evidence like being put you down or lying or love-bombing. But what you‚Äôll see that they're disconnection from reality and living in their own mind - THAT is the marker you‚Äôre gonna know you‚Äôre dealing with a narcissist. 

The Peter Pan types can be dreamers, probably from single-mother homes, and most certainly always regress into a child-like state whereby you can be projected upon as the mother/savior/Madonna that they crave. They can idealize love to the point of romantic delusion (thanks Disney!). Have an urge-to-merge (watch out soul mate/Twin Flame). And can be tricky because they have a good grasp of emotional relating that‚Äôs actually all smoke and mirrors. 

You‚Äôre being pushed to sympathize or find understanding with their perspective. It‚Äôs not and never has been about YOU and your needs/wants/boundaries. 

We need to call these men what they are = narcissists. 

They‚Äôll appear sensitive and intuitive. They‚Äôll gain your sympathy with stories of overcoming their past. They‚Äôll even take action when you explain their lack of thoughtfulness or ‚Äúmisunderstandings‚Äù. But make no mistake, a tiger doesn‚Äôt change its colors, and most certainly not overnight. 

These Peter Pan men are emotionally stunted individuals who have learned the game of emotional relating to women in a way to pull on our heartstrings. They‚Äôll have ‚Äúcoming to Jesus‚Äù moments followed by words that you‚Äôre hoping to hear. Make no mistake, they‚Äôve been listening to you like any other narc to use your vulnerabilities as their weapons or to trigger you by their projections. You might feel gratified by being validated in the moment but think about the bigger picture‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Is this worth your time? Are you feeling frustrated and unheard? Are you actually just building up this emotionally stunted man? Is this really what you want?

laey4s,I'm not apologizing for not checking your pockets before doing the laundry,"This was several years ago -- my boyfriend at the time was crashing at my temp corporate housing I recieved from my new job. I tossed our clothes in the laundry for us one day, and when he went to go move them from the washer to the dryer, he realized his leather wallet had been washed.

He had apparently forgetten to take it out of his pocket. At the time, my reaction was something along the lines of ""oh no, it happens, it'll mostly be okay when it dries."" He was really upset about it because it was expensive and something he got with an old friend -- understandable -- but what I didn't understand was when he started getting cross with me. Basically blaming me for not checking the pockets of his pants before putting it in the wash, which I responded saying that I wouldn't even think to check since women don't have functional pockets and that it's on him to check his clothes before putting them in the hamper.

We argued about this for a while and then he claims he expected me to apologize for my part in it, since I was the one who put the clothes in the washer and I clearly wasn't showing responsibility for my actions and their consequences to him. I just let it go and told him I was sorry for washing his wallet, and even though I never really got his perspective, a part of me was left wondering that maybe I was in the wrong and maybe I wasn't being compassionate, empathetic, or otherwise a good person in that moment.

Anyway, now thanks to FDS I feel a lot more confident that it wasn't a situation I needed to apologize for at all. I wasn't his mom! and he was plenty old enough to know to empty his pockets! Like, there's only yourself to blame in that situation and girlfriends aren't just there to accept responsibility on your behalf. And of course, no more letting boyfriends live with me before a large commitment or helping with their chores üôÑ

laeoiv,Why We Take the High Road,"In life you have to make major life choices. These major choices branch off and form your life course. Most of us are given options to take the hard right or easy left. We see these choices reflected in women‚Äôs lives every day. However, many women in this world have no choices and move from their fathers‚Äô home to their husbands‚Äô. She is never free. This situation reflects most of history. Women have rarely have the power of choice. If you are reading this and have choice in your life, you should see this as the most treasured gift in history. It is the rarest and most hard fought for freedom women have obtained. We need to reframe your mind to truly appreciate this. 

First, what does the path of the easy left look like? I think its familiar to all of us. Pandering to a man. You keep your low standards. You find him randomly on OLD. You quickly become obsessing with ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù him and worrying he like you. He gets away with blowing hot and cold. He pressures you into degrading sex acts because his ex ‚Äúloved‚Äù it. You feel worthless so you go along with whatever he suggests. However, from the outside no one says anything because you are doing the right thing and are settled down with a man. They don't see his increasing need for sexual violence to get off. You focus on cooking and cleaning for him. He moves in. You do all the chores because he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù a mess. You get pregnant and he decides to go on a road trip to Mexico with the boys to blow off some steam. You feel abandoned and miserable most of the time. No one says anything because you‚Äôre doing all the right things in life. He doesn‚Äôt want to get married, but your okay to compromise your standards so he doesn‚Äôt leave you. He checks out further from the relationship. You have stopped having sex. You feel so alone with him. You‚Äôre too scared to check his phone. The years drag on and on. You have a couple more kids to bring you closer together. Suddenly its 10 years later and he‚Äôs leaving you for a younger girl. Don‚Äôt worry, he won‚Äôt fight you for custody. Wait, he marrying her after 6 months? He sends you a wedding invite to rub it in your face. The world blames you for not keeping him happy. You let yourself go. You should have tried harder.

We preach the ‚Äúhard right‚Äù on FDS. What does this path look like? You never download OLD because you‚Äôre focusing on your degree, career, networking, hiking, working out or personal development. You feel lonely because everyone else is in a relationship, but you know being single isn‚Äôt a punishment. You really get to know yourself for a few months or years. You miss sex, you‚Äôre skin starved and you miss touch. It‚Äôs okay, you have internalized that you‚Äôre a social animal and human. You‚Äôre a sexual being. However, not just anyone gets to touch you. Respect, honestly and loyalty are the only way to your heart, mind and body. You want bonding. Passion. Love. You won‚Äôt settle because you know what settling gets you. People ask why you are single constantly. You make them uncomfortable. Many people call you selfish for choosing to be single. Maybe even your own family. 

Throughout history humans have had to tackle loneliness and sorrow. These times build character and self-respect. You stand to gain so much because no man is actively tearing you down. No death by a thousand cuts for you. It‚Äôs the hard right ever easy? No, it is absolutely hard and demoralizing sometimes. You are going against the grain of society and people will take it personally. Just keeping moving forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/laeoiv/why_we_take_the_high_road/,1612214903.0,285,0.95,18,FemaleDatingStrategy,GIfuckingJane
laea2u,Why We Support Investment: The Fallacy of Focusing on Financial Investment,"Today, in a self-proclaimed woman-centric sub, known for their liberal feminist perspective and catering to male voices, they are currently discussing the horrors of FDS. Some comments disapproved of financial investment from men‚Äîlabeling it as regressive.

Why do we *dare* ask for financial investment from potential romantic partners?

This question contorted itself in my brain.

We expect potential partners to invest their resources into pursuing a relationship with us. That does not simply mean money‚Äîas many critics highlight‚Äî but time, attention, thought, and emotional effort. Even here, seasoned members continuously correct newer ones that wealth does not make a HVM. Let's break down what investment is through juxtaposition of high value and low value behavior.

A man who takes you to an expensive seafood restaurant when you have mentioned to him before that you are allergic to shrimp. He asked you out the day before and spent $350 on the date, but he:

(1) Did not pay attention to your words.

(2) Took you to a seafood restaurant knowing you were allergic to shrimp‚Äî limiting your ordering choices and risking you having an allergic reaction due to cross-contamination.

(3) Arranged the date the day before‚Äîshowing no respect for your time.

Although he invested financially, he lacked respect for you in other areas. His actions illustrated his lack of care towards you. He disregarded your words, health, and time. It would not be surprising if he, later on, **disregards other factors** or if **his disregard becomes intensified**. Not valuing your time *now* can translate to not valuing your time in 10 years when you spend 2 hours daily domestically, while he contributes a mere 30 minutes of watching your toddler while you shower. Of course, this is conjecture. But remember that red flags able to be ignored early on in relationships become more pronounced and detrimental to your growth as the relationship progresses.

A man who hand-makes a charcuterie board with fancy glasses and spritzer and buys your favorite jam and cheese to take you out on a picnic date by the waterfront because you mentioned wanting to watch the sunset by the harbor is a man who cares about investing in a relationship with you. He asked you a week in advance for your availability and spent $40 curating this evening for you, but he:

(1) Paid attention to your words.

(2) Spent time and effort in hand curating a fancy picnic basket making sure that your favorite items were included.

(3) Spent time researching the best areas to watch the sunset in the harbor.

(4) Checked the weather for the best day to take you out on a date to make sure it was not windy or raining.

In this situation, he invested with a myriad of disparate resources. He invested by putting in **emotional labor** of planning a date around your interests and propensities, using **time management** to check which days would suit both wonderful weather and your schedule, illustrating **respect** for your time by asking you out in advance instead of presuming your availability, **financial effort** by purchasing items to create a picnic, paying **attention** to your words by taking note of your interests and favorite refreshments, and **physical labor** and **time** to curate a charcuterie board for your date.

Do not fall into the fallacy of solely focusing on financial resource as an investment. There are low value and high value individuals with extravagant wealth.

Pay attention to all types of investment to minimize low value presence from your life‚Äîwhether they are individuals in your dating, social, familial, or professional spheres. Do not fall into the fallacy of believing that financial investment is an indication of high value behavior. It is *one* indication of investment, but there are other indications of investment to also consider.

Furthermore, **investment is an indication of how much a person values you**. If a man does not invest in you, he does not and will not ever value you‚Äî nor will he value your efforts, attention, emotional labor, physical contribution, and time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/laea2u/why_we_support_investment_the_fallacy_of_focusing/,1612213882.0,524,0.95,43,FemaleDatingStrategy,honumaluhia

First caller delivers already. A married woman, she recently celebrated her wedding anniversary with her husband. D‚Äôyou know what he got her? Any guesses? He got her a ROBOT VACUUM CLEANER.

Gosh, that good-for-nothing husband just lets his wife repeatedly ask him to do the vacuuming until she‚Äôs so sick of it she does it herself at expense of her spending time with their child. What a way to fuck over both your wife and child. Then he gifts her a gift for himself and the poor woman is so deep in she can‚Äôt see how bullshit this is?!

Seriously, even the radio guy expected her to be at least mildly annoyed at this dumbass ‚Äúgift‚Äù. Not to worry, the next female caller had gotten brake discs from an ex-bf as a birthday gift, and she was less happy (but not as pissed as she should‚Äôve been) about it.

laa105,"As of today, February 1, 2021, I am DONE being a pick-me doormat!","DONE! I am so fucking sick and tired of feeling like I do right now. Hurt, sad, angry, disappointed, less-than. I have been doing this shit since I was 18 and I'm DONE! I'm sick of bending over backwards, ignoring the red flags, accepting the bare minimum, pretending like they will change and be different with me. I'm not wasting one more goddamn year like this.

A couple weeks ago, I posted in another sub, under my previous username, about my relationship issue. Long story short, I discovered in my boyfriend's internet history on his computer that he has been going into a chatroom fucking constantly. I confronted him and he was so nonchalant about it. He even admitted to emailing another girl because he was bored. Bored! He literally didn't see anything wrong with it and I left in tears. Everyone told me that I needed to talk to him, understand why he felt like he needed to do that, etc. Except one woman, but I'll get back to that.

I have spent the last two weeks waiting for this man, wondering what I could have done differently. He has not once reached out to me. I have cried and binged until I was sick. I've gained about 10 pounds. The last 4 days, inbetween crying and binging, I've done a lot of thinking and soul-searching. Why do I do this?

1. It's what I was taught. My mom is a pick-me and taught me that is how it is. My whole life she has been a revolving door of men who treated her like shit. She has been married 4 times, engaged 5, gone bankrupt because of them. I guess I thought that it was normal.

2. My weight. Before I get started on this one, I don't want this to feel like an attack to any woman here that is big and happy with herself. This is just my own personal feelings about my body. Because I am obese, I've told myself that this is what I deserve. I should be happy that any man is interested in me. I should deal with it because it's what I deserve. Which brings me to point 3...

3. My self-esteem. Because of my upbringing, my weight, and all of my past ""relationships,"" my self-esteem is non-existent. I don't put much effort into my appearance or clothes, because I don't think there is a point. ""I'm already fat and ugly so why bother putting on nice clothes or makeup,"" I say to myself.

NO MORE! Starting today, I'm teaching myself self-love. I will finish reading the handbook. I'm going to lose this 50 pounds I've been carrying around, for myself and no one else. I'm going to work on building my confidence up, for myself and no one else. I'm going to do things that make ME happy. I have wasted ages 18 - 28 trying to please them and be the cool girl or whatever. NO MORE!

I want to thank the FDS goddess that sent me a message and showed me the light. I deleted the other account you sent that message to before I could thank you, so I hope you see this somehow ‚ù§ I even made this account after you messaged me with the intent on posting here, but I naively held onto the hope he would come back to me begging for forgiveness. Nope! Your girl is done living like that üíÉüíÉ I do know myself and I know it will take time. I'm still hurting and crying as I write this, but I'll get there. I know I can can do it.

We survive fine without them, and live happy, quiet, harmless lives - and that's when they start cracking whips at us.

I suspect a huge reason women all over the world are treated horribly is *because* we're a resource to them, and the boots on our necks are the only things keeping us from losing our shit at them. 

Think about it. If they didn't need us, then why would they do everything they can to access us? They aren't afraid of female power because they actually think we'll be cruel to them. They're afraid of comparisons being made that make their gender look bad. 

Most male-female interaction is the male pushing his value systems down our throats, and harassing us until we either cave or get away. These aren't interactions. It's just brainwashing. 

If you ask nearly any man you know (if you still care to talk to men) which gender is better, almost every single one will say men.

la83mr,"BF pretends to be happily married family man at work, then yells at his GF when she accidentally lets it slip to co-worker that they're not married","**Note: I have edited the post to remove any references to the original subreddit to which it was posted. Below is a direct copy and paste of the post, with the brackets solely removing the identifying features of the sub. Bolded text are my own words.**

""\[Am I in the wrong for\] telling my boyfriend's co-worker that we're not married?

I've been with Boyfriend for about 5 years. We live together. He does not want to get married, which I'm fine with now, but it was a point of contention early on in our relationship.

Boyfriend was talking to Co-worker on zoom when I brought him some coffee. Co-worker said something like ""so this is the lovely wife I've heard so much about"". I said something like ""thanks but we're not married"". He said ""oh, Boyfriend always calls you his wife"", and then introduced himself, I introduced myself, then ended the conversation and left as quickly I could while still being polite because both Boyfriend and Co-worker were giving me a weird vibe.

A little while later, Boyfriend came out of the office and asked ""what was that?"". I didn't know what he meant so I asked ""what was what?"". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.

This somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.

He then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.

I then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and ""no fucking way am I doing that"", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.""

la4hoc,Slow Fade,"Hello wonderful community, 

I thought I‚Äôd make a post dedicated to my least favourite form of ghosting which I believe is called the ‚Äòslow fade‚Äô. Hopefully my insights will be useful to you all because I don‚Äôt want anyone to have to suffer the same consequences I did. 


What: 

The slow fade occurs when someone you are dating or talking to, slowly eases communication and communicates less frequently until they are gone entirely. Breadcrumbing or ‚Äòputting you on the back burner‚Äô is similar except they keep you around with minimal effort and never commit to completely disappearing so as to keep you as an option. I find this usually occurs through Snapchat (sending a vague image with no text, streaks etc.) or Instagram (reacting to your story, liking photos). Basically any social media where they can interact with you without sending a message with any substance or directivity. 


The warning signs 

- Lovebombing (intense comments, overly complimenting you, over sharing early on) 
- Relationship moves too fast (pressure for sex early etc) 
- Relationship seems ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù 
- They just got out of a relationship or are struggling mentally
- Messaging you too frequently (eg. Constantly, using you as a distraction) 

- You feel uneasy and anxious
- They slowly ease communication &amp; message you infrequently after getting to know them
- They stop making plans or showing any interest after they had previously been very enthusiastic. 
- They disappear with no explanation or break up text 


When: 

Can occur after any amount of time but in my experience it happened after a two week long period of intense lovebombing. There‚Äôs no way to tell how long someone is committed to the facade, they might keep it up for years. There‚Äôs really no way to prevent it other than usual vetting for red flags. I found that lovebombing was a clear pretence though, and it‚Äôs a part of why it feels so jarring when they disappear because they had previously been so loving/attentive &amp; interested. 

Why: 

It is a way for them to end a relationship with you whilst leaving space for them to possibly return or reappear in the future. They might do so when they are bored or their other options have failed. It leaves ambiguity and allows them to control the narrative by returning for more. 

In my experience I was dating someone for a couple of months who lovebombed me very intensely. After awhile, communication slowly became less frequent until we had stopped talking entirely. 6 months later he returned, upset and claiming he was hurt that I had rejected him and left the relationship. When I explained that it was his inaction and inconsistency that lead me to stop reaching out, he gaslit me saying that that never happened. I blocked him and moved on.

Watch for lovebombing early on in a relationship. Trust your gut if communication has slowed, or they are texting different.

I find a lot of dating subs shame women for feeling anxious in the early stages of dating when the other person is inconsistent or becomes more unavailable. Trust your gut because it knows before your mind does. In the early stages of dating, you should feel secure &amp; effort shouldn‚Äôt be too intense or feel like not enough. 

If someone pulls this on you, block them so they can‚Äôt return. You snooze, you lose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/la4hoc/slow_fade/,1612190397.0,281,0.97,52,FemaleDatingStrategy,poody456

I had a discussion with my redpill scumbag stepdad a few years back, who let me know that in order for a marriage to work, sometimes women just need to let a man ""do it"" so he can carry on with his day. 

So, not only do married women not get to orgasm after YEARS OF SEX with some dbag, we typically have OUR WORKDAY interrupted, get halfway turned on, get pumped and dumped by a dudebro who is statistically more likely to be cheating than not, and then GUESS. WHAT. 

If we ""waste time"" taking care of their unfinished business, they'll complain about whatever chore that was left unfinished. 

I keep ranting about this, but there's a reason. 

Marriage. Is. Not. The. Ultimate. Goal.

l9s2og,My experience in BDSM community (Long read),"I only have an account on FetLife.com so I'll talk about my experience there. It's basically like regular dating, except all the guys are up front with how weird and crazy they are. From what I've seen and experienced, the BDSM community it is mostly for and benefits men. Even the female domination kink seems to benefit men and is very performative. There's this whole, weird issue with people in the community hating findom (financial domination) because it's abusive and exploitive (but at the same time they're ok with physical and mental kinks). I just don't understand how they can be okay with one and not okay with the other, if they say consent is so important. If a guy (it's usually woman with male pay pigs) consents to having his bank account drained, how is he different than the person that consents to get beaten? After thinking about it, the only difference I see is that the ones in control are women and they're taking the men's money. Often sex isn't involved so there's not sexual benefit for the man so I see why so many men are against it. People in the community also don't like OnlyFans or professional dominatrixes. Basically FetLife exists for men to get free porn and free sex without having to pay sex workers/content creators. These same guys probably hate to pay for dinner on dates. Women are putting their bodies and livelihoods (because the fall out from being female and kinky is different for women) at risk for these kinks and the dudes only have aftercare to offer. The hate pros, because they actually have more power than the women in the community that to BDSM for free. They actually have to vet men and will do background checks.

Don't get me started on the race fetishists. They want to consume black bodies (BBC, serve Black masters/mistress) and role play behind closed doors, but when it comes to actually doing something that benefits the Black person (orgasms don't count) or community and they've got nothing. 

So many guys use their penis size as a personality trait. Like, their photo album will be a much of photos of their ashy dick from the same angle as if that's appealing. 

A lot of women put so much effort into their photos and these hairy dudes with beer guts posts pics of their unmanscaped pubes, old boxers, and dirty rooms in the background. The guys that are actually attractive are just like the guys on dating apps trying to have regular sex with random people without having to go on a date. Then there's the dark weirdos that are just all kinds of creepy. There's a guy in my area who I think is a legit pimp. His submissives are prostitutes that have to make an OnlyFans account, from which he probably takes all of most of the proceeds. I can't say for certain, but it's the vibe I get. I was talking to a local guy and my suspicions were mostly confirmed. He's small and doesn't go to that guy's parties because he'd probably get assaulted. **What sort of things could I do if I suspect prostitution?** Could I call in a tip? I'm worried about retaliation, even though I've been somewhat anonymous. 

I see a lot of beautiful women on the site, pretty enough to be models, but they're spread eagle on the internet, for what... There are women that post this kind of content and don't even get paid for it. Content on the internet is forever. Which is why I made a point to never show my face or pose nude. Do they want to be sex workers forever? Can we expect the world to change so that women who are former sex workers can make career changes? At least back in the day if you did sex work you could move out of state. Now you post photos the whole world can see. I do worry about my time there, but I've been trying to conduct myself as if the whole world were watching. Like, my profile is embarrassing, but I don't think/hope it's not career damaging. :( **Anyone that used to be into BDSM worry about the fall out? Have you ever been exposed?**

The longer I've been on FetLife, the more I'm annoyed, saddened, and just grossed out by sex and men. Though recently I've started making posts about how trash the site and how trash men are in general. After being on the FetLife and reading on here I just feel like dating at this point is so tragic and will be a big disappointment. I was very eager to start back dating and really wanted to meet guys, but as 2020 rolled on and we're now in 2021 I'm not as excited. It just feels hopeless. I'm okay with being single, I guess, but I'd like a guy to spend time with in the future. A vibrator just isn't the same. There's not enough good guys out there for all of us. I feel like the guys that I might have met in real life aren't that different than the men on FetLife. Maybe it's just the dating app guys?? I feel like the next guy I date is going have to be Christian and either celibate or extremely sexually conservative. I've seen too much.

l9n1c3,Bloom wherever the hell you want!,"I really do not like the quote ‚Äúbloom where you are planted‚Äù. 

It denotes a narrative that wherever you end up in life you must grow and thrive there. Where you are. Where you were planted. 

And I just don‚Äôt believe that is right.

If you see a little girl who is brought up in a home where abuse is rampant and love is lost, would you tell her to ‚Äúmake do with what you have‚Äù?? Bloom where you are planted??

Would you tell a person in a toxic relationship to ‚Äúlook on the bright side‚Äù? To bloom where they are planted? 

A plant left in darkness withers. A flower without water dies. If we repress our human desires for ‚Äúlight‚Äù and ‚Äúwater‚Äù, aka love and happiness, then we too will wither and die.

No. We have free will. We have endless opportunities to leave the situations that we find hinder us from our growth. 

We are not plants. We are not flowers. We are humans. We have souls. We are beings of light. 

If we are stuck in situations where we do not have the opportunities we need in our lives to thrive, we have the option to leave! To remove ourselves from toxicity. To surround ourselves with things and people that help us to grow and thrive. We do not need to depend on other people to ‚Äúwater‚Äù us. 

A better quote I feel would be ‚Äúbloom wherever the hell you want‚Äù! Growth is not limited to the situations you were ‚Äòplanted‚Äô in.

l9myzo,Yet another thankful post to you ladies,"A month or so back, another woman posted on here to ‚Äúbeware of LVM hitting you up on personal anniversaries‚Äù, and I have to say that post hit the nail on the head.

My NVM ex emailed me yesterday to let me know that I, ahem, ‚Äúruined the notion of love for him‚Äù by leaving him. When I saw that I laughed, because based on how he treated me, he never knew what love was in the first place. He sent the message because it was the day our marriage license expired (I was THAT CLOSE to making the biggest mistake of my life before I wised up and left). And to further prove his dumbassery, he thinks that made us legally married... when in fact it‚Äôs basically a government-signed permission slip to GET married. Not a real, finalized marriage. 

I haven‚Äôt responded and have no plans to.  Because of you queens and the support you offer to everyone, even those of us who knew no other way than whatever unhealthy messages we got from our parents. 

I found this sub after I left him, and spent months kicking myself for not knowing better sooner. Every mistake you could make, I made in that relationship - pursuing a man, taking financial charge, excusing his pornsick nonsense. But now I know better. Now I feel better about who I am and what I deserve. And no man can take that away from me, because of y‚Äôall.

l9jgfk,"Not sure if this is allowed here, but more women should know about comphet","Comphet, or compulsory heterosexuality is the word used by wlw (women loving women, general term that covers the relevant parts of LGBTQ+) to describe the cultural phenomenon where women are pressured by society to want a heterosexual or heteronormative relationship, *regardless of if they‚Äôre actually attracted to men.* 

Now most of this subreddit is probably actually straight, but even if this post doesn‚Äôt help you figure out your own sexuality, being knowledgeable about cultural misogyny can only help you keep your standards high. Comphet doesn‚Äôt just drive lesbians to marry men and bi women to live as straight, it also drives straight women to settle for any relationship with a man over the thought of being alone. 

So into the meat of it: do any of you remember being a little girl and learning that apparently all little girls have their dream wedding planned when they‚Äôre still kids? And kinda go: *yikes, guess I better come up with a dream wedding?* and think of something really ‚ÄúPrincess marries the handsome prince at the end of a Disney movie‚Äù? Or did you read a teen magazine and try to follow the tips on how to make boys like you? Or read/watch story after story where if the protagonist is a woman she ends the story in a heterosexual relationship with man even if that‚Äôs not what the story was about? (Looking at you Disney Mulan) Well, those are some early developmental things that condition women to see pleasing men and marriage to a man as a necessary part of being a women. Society isn‚Äôt kind to women who reject this, weather they choose their career, their art, their happiness, or a women over marriage with a man, she‚Äôs seen as defective, a feminazi, a man hater. Not centering your life around pleasing men is perceived as hate. 

Does this sound familiar?

I found this really helpful, you might too. Also, if you are questioning your sexuality and want more resources, there‚Äôs a sub for late bloomer lesbians that has a lot of good stuff in their sidebar, but I‚Äôm not going to link directly so as not to violate rule 15, I say this because if you just look up ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù on Reddit you will see porn and I don‚Äôt want that for you. 

For me, this discussion is more than just academic. I‚Äôve been on this sub for well over a year and for most of that time I was in a relationship with a HVM. He was really amazing, and I probably could have married him and had an ok life, he would have been a good husband, but I came to the realization a little before our one year anniversary that I was never going to be truly happy with him, he was never going to be enough for me, no matter what he did. I identified as bisexual for a long time but only really put effort into dating men because that‚Äôs the life I thought I needed to have. My parents are constantly pressing me to settle down and have kids, I‚Äôm classically feminine and part of cultural femininity is appealing to the male gaze, I grew up seeing heterosexual love as the only type that was an opinion for me, and lesbians as wacky weirdos to laughed at in TV shows like Friends but never identified with. 

Well, I broke up with him a week ago, he handled it really well and was super understanding, it was the most HV breakup imaginable. He even read up on comp het and has been really supportive, even though it hurt him a lot. And my experiences with him really did finally convince me that there are good men out there, so hetero sisters don‚Äôt give up, just because relationships with men are forced on women doesn‚Äôt make all of them bad, if a guy is a HVM and you really do love him, you can have an amazing life. But don‚Äôt settle, and for my sisters who aren‚Äôt sure they want to end up with a man, for whatever reason: it‚Äôs ok, you don‚Äôt have to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/l9jgfk/not_sure_if_this_is_allowed_here_but_more_women/,1612120335.0,459,0.95,53,FemaleDatingStrategy,Nifteroni-and-Cheese
l9hz7h,"Interesting thought on ""not all men.""","There is currently an adorable video of a dog smiling at the top of a popular sub. I'll avoid linking it or giving hints at to which sub, but take a look at popular and you might catch it.

Unfortunately, said dog is a pitbull, which brings out the anti-pitbull crowd to give their usual ""all pits are dangerous!"" rant while simultaneously complaining that Reddit as a whole glorifies pitbulls.

Now, you may feel however you feel about specific dog breeds. I do have a soft spot for pits and Rottweilers, but that's not the main point here.

A quick search says that pit bulls are responsible for [66 percent of dog-related fatalities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/09/13/americas-most-dangerous-dog-breeds-infographic/?sh=1d545f2562f8). A lot of people point to that statistic and feel justified in staying away from or even ""euthanizing"" all pit bulls and mutts with pit blood in them. Insurance companies use stats like this to spike homeowner's insurance rates or even refuse to cover your home should you have a dog of a designated breed.

Now consider the ""not all men"" rhetoric that's also common on Reddit. We apparently have no right to be suspicious of men, because not all of them are violent. ~~And they'll prove that with threats and harassment!~~

Let's look at [violent crime stats by sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime).

&gt;Males constituted 98.9% of those arrested for forcible rape[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 87.9% of those arrested for robbery[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 85.0% of those arrested for burglary[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 83.0% of those arrested for [arson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson).[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 81.7% of those arrested for vandalism.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 81.5% of those arrested for motor-vehicle theft.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 79.7% of those arrested for offenses against family and children.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)  
&gt;  
&gt;Males constituted 77.8% of those arrested for aggravated assault[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime#cite_note-:2-52)

These stats are from 2011, but I doubt the balance has shifted that much in 10 years.

Further up in the page there are a few lines that men are more likely to be victims in certain crimes, but which sex is more likely to be the perpetrator?

Men as a whole are statistically more likely to be perpetrators of violent acts than pitbulls, but we're meant to be suspicious of dogs instead of humans.

Other fun facts: The odds are being attacked by a shark are [1 in 11.5 million.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack) Odds of dying from that attack are substantially lower.

Odds of being attacked by bears are around [1 in 2.1 million](https://petpedia.co/bear-attack-statistics/).

[Less than half of car accidents are fatal](https://www.safetyinsurance.com/driversafety/tips_statistics.html), yet road safety laws exist relatively unchallenged.

Now, does this mean our safety concerns are aimed at the wrong targets? Or that our increased caution is keeping us safe? Either way, there's a strong case to be made for women applying some of that same caution to our dating lives.

What sex is not, and I encourage women who unfortunately experienced this stuff to consider it merely assisted masturbation:

- Enduring painful jack hammering for a man's sexual pleasure. 

- Being pressured into performing acts that you do not find sexually arousing/painful/degrading for a man's sexual pleasure. 

- Being purposely neglected sexually, not being listened to despite CoMmUnICaTion, being taken for granted in bed by men who think they know your body better than you do. 


I think about this topic very often and the weight of the word sex in our society. 
Now words like rape are being replaced by ""non consensual sex"", almost as if the intercourse alone could be considered sex. 
I could have intercourse with a scrote who doesn't care about pleasing me. Is this sex? Not to me. He masturbated with my body.

l9f5ud,The Risks Associated with Dating in the Modern Era,"1. Nothing is sacred to most men, especially their own bodies. They push, abuse and manipulate their bodies and minds for porn highs, casual sex and quick thrills because being a person of good character doesn't immediately feed those ""reward systems"". The modern condition is immediate gratification. If he doesn't respect his own body and mind, what makes you think he will respect yours? 

2. You will be forced to compete with other women &amp; digital images. It's a racket. It's manufactured to keep us chasing beauty, youth and men. Hollywood, Big Porn, the alt-right all want the same thing. Root women's fear of other women in competition. The fear of our own real bodies &amp; choices. It's the divide and conquer strategy of 'Woman' as a concept. Keep us awash with extremely altered digital images that are impossible for a human to obtain and keep men chasing hundreds of thousands of pixilated women that no one woman can compete with. His own digital harem of women in every shape, size and color. Can the modern man ever be satisfied? 

3. You will be betrayed. Most men are trained to see you as an object. If you cross over into leadership roles or power and your very body acts as a political statement against the masculine order. In our own relationships we ask for the bare minimum: loyalty, respect and honesty. Very few women receive it. It's easier for men to lie and tell us what we want to hear all while dong the same patriarchal things over and over. Again, there is a lack of character in modern men with their dealings with women at all levels. Our culture supports men's lies to women by calling us ""high maintenance"" or by saying we are ""asking for too much"". Cut him some slack at the expense of your own mental health, ladies! This culture wants you to be above all,  *a self-sacrificing woman*. 

4. You will not be enough to fulfill a many men's bottomless lusts. The modern man grew up with porn at his fingertips. Our culture is obsessed with extreme youth and beauty. The system is set up to fail you, since, as a human, you live within space and time. We all age. Men are somewhat given space to do so... We are not. Men without character have been trading their wives in for younger models without impunity since Napoleon up to Elon Musk. We need to hold them accountable. We are not interchangeable objects to be discarded and thrown away at a man's whim. 

5. Condomless sex.... The number one request prostitutes get from their clients. Many of these men are married or have a partner. Liberal feminism is pro sex work and seeks to increase men's access to women's bodies for money. Pure capitalization of women's bodies to be used by multiple men. These men then get to also have access to their girlfriends or wives bodies. Once again, we have to bear the brunt of men's horrible sexual choices because they don't think of our mental or physical health. 

This is why I don't condone OLD. It plays into men's burned out dopamine receptors. You are just an object found online, like porn, like sex workers. You are not a real person, just one of many woman's bodies to be used and discarded. It's not worth the risks. Your mental health is worth more then this. Your body is worth more then this. Take your time and be okay alone first, then try and meet men organically through ways that are vetting through a community. Through friends, classes, meet ups, and even family. Men who are not tied to you though other connections are really, really hard to vet. Its hard right now during a pandemic, but I honestly don't think OLD is worth the risk *anytime*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/l9f5ud/the_risks_associated_with_dating_in_the_modern_era/,1612108940.0,525,0.92,74,FemaleDatingStrategy,GIfuckingJane

l9dmat,"Found close friend‚Äôs bf on tinder, lies presume","Hi yall, first post here and i mostly need to rant. TLDR at bottom.

I‚Äôve been pretty active on tinder and hinge the past few months. Last night i checked tinder and low and behold-while swiping i saw my friend‚Äôs bf. 

I took every screenshot immediately and decided to text her, asking if they were on good terms. Spoiler alert, they argue a lot but are still together. 

I sent the screenshots of his account, saying i found his active profile as tinder only shows profiles active within the past week, and that i was sending her these bc its suspicious and i care about her.

Mind you, he had at least five pictures uploaded, one being a picture she took of him. His instagram was linked to his profile meaning he had to sign into IG through tinder, AND he had a blue check verification on his profile meaning he took a selfie to confirm it was really him. Meaning he is guilty lol.

My friend confronted him and was strong at first‚Äîand then a few hours later started being in denial and listening to every white lie he told her. Apparently his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù made that account for him as a joke last year and ‚Äúforgot to sign out or delete the account‚Äù. He even had this crazy screenshot of a snapchat conversation of his friend clearly defending his story to help his bumass out. This friend allegedly lives in another state.....

I know i cannot control what people do in their lives and relationships, and i may even be crossing a boundary. but its crazy to me that men will lie to your face unprovoked, have others lie for you. and guilt you‚Äîeven when you know deep down they‚Äôre wrong because you don‚Äôt want to think the worst of people. 

Hell, i went on a few dates with a man earlier this month who fell into a ‚Äúdepressive episode‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt tell me what was going on. i left him alone and a few days later i was blocked and deleted off of social media. Clearly he wanted to scope out new people but was too chicken to say that upfront.

Has anyone else dealt with this situation? Its driving me crazy.

TL;DR: Found friend‚Äôs boyfriend of 1.5 years on dating/sex app, profile was completely filled out and verified. Texting argument ensued, he even had a scrote friend lie and defend him as well. Friend ends up eventually believing in his gaslighting bc he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in infidelity‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt go through the motions of this. Yeah ok

update: thanks so much for y‚Äôalls support. it‚Äôs upsetting that so many of us can relate to this problem, its incredibly toxic. my friend just let me know today that they broke up so i am relieved she finally listened to her gut, and i hope she stays strong and no contact with him and focuses on herself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/l9dmat/found_close_friends_bf_on_tinder_lies_presume/,1612104292.0,164,0.98,30,FemaleDatingStrategy,twinpeeks420

l9bciy,Men thinking we don‚Äôt like s*x because we didn‚Äôt had ‚Äúgood one yet‚Äù,"This is going on in my mind for a while and remind me of old conversations I‚Äôve had with men when I was still in my pickme phase back then.

Without going too much into detail, I‚Äôve heard time and time again that men think the only reason why some women don‚Äôt like sex or consider to be asexual is just that they didn‚Äôt had good sex yet and they would change their mind if the right men comes along to ‚Äúshow‚Äù then.
This kind of comment always irritated me even back then because I always wonder how someone can come up with this kind of conclusion and basically undermine a women‚Äôs own sexuality especially when it comes to being asexual.

In my personal case I‚Äôve had experience and while I consider some of them good, it never made me crave it or going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù to the point that my whole mind would be clouded just by it. I could always a-knowledge that I had a good experience while still not wanting to do more shortly after and if being honest, I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth most of the time since I‚Äôm so much more in ease and happy if I have personal projects to care about then schedule my whole weekend around this one thing.

It made me wonder if this is again a part of projections or men‚Äôs arrogance in thinking that they have some magic d*ck that can change women‚Äôs opinion and values as if we aren‚Äôt able to think on our own. Besides with asexual women, I heard these situations coming up a lot also with women who are Bisexual or into women. Men‚Äôs only possible conclusion seems always to be ‚ÄúWell, she didn‚Äôt met the right men yet to show her and she will change her mind once she does.‚Äù

I wonder what your opinion is on it.
Obviously, I don‚Äôt talk about my sexuality to men anymore, it‚Äôs all in the past. I only wonder if anyone else experiences the same or similar.

Edit; I'm asexual so this comes from my perspective of dealing with men's comments about my sexuality. In no way I intend to shame anyone who enjoys sex.

kfwnuc,"A realization hit me today, and I'm actually very much disgusted at myself.","So back in my pick-me days, I used to get teased around, disrespected, and harassed online quite a lot by the guys in my class. They took pictures of them making phallic gestures and used to send it to me on Facebook. They also used to call me a lot of derogatory words quite often.

I was 14; I used to think it was just them playing around, and shrugged it all off because I was the *""cOoLeSt GiRl in ClAsS""* (ü§°)

Man, what a fuck-up that was!

They did it because I was lenient enough to let them shit all over me. I let myself be used as a doormat  because I thought it made me look so cool (*Yiiiikes!üò¨)*

5 years later, today, long after having recovered from the pick-me days, I was randomly scrolling through this sub and it suddenly hit me what an absolute clown I was to think that being disrespected made me cooler. Couldn't help but feel a little traumatized by the memories from 5 years ago.

But thank goodness, I found this sub!

kfqqjf,The Hypocrisy of Career Men,"As one of the few women in an extremely male dominated area in the military, I‚Äôve been very lucky to receive tons of mentorship from men who I respect. I would go to war with these men and I have their backs completely, in a professional way. However, I see their misogyny in a new, enlightened perspective, which I want to share with you here. From these men‚Äôs perspective, I am just as ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù as them. What does that mean? Let‚Äôs really break this down.
Every male mentor I have encountered has told me to never get married. Every single one. Yet every one of them? Is married. What does this tell you?


1) These ‚Äúgreat‚Äù successful, brilliant men don‚Äôt see their wives as partners. Women fulfill a specific role, and that is to prop up and help advance HIS goals. These women have often left careers as lawyers, nurses and career women with dreams of their own to follow him around. His career was the important one and the relationship would only continue on his end once she gave up hers.


2) The woman functions as the main parent, his caretaker and the manager of his life. This is why he is so great. He has love, a family and a happy home being run for him. He gets a woman handling all the domestic tasks so he can focus all his energy on his work. He‚Äôs advancing with more schooling, the next educational goal, his next venture. She‚Äôs facilitating.


3) My mentors know a man won‚Äôt do this for me. Let that sink in. This is fundamentally what they mean. It‚Äôs better for me to go it alone, because a man will probably drag me down and divide my attention from my life goals‚Ä¶. Because men are not raised to function as an extension of women's life. *Men just won‚Äôt do for you what you are trained from birth to do for them.* They know. They tell me all the time.


It is disheartening to be around the best of men, and still see them lacking. That even the most intelligent, strategic military officers lack the introspection to fix this. I mean, why would men do anything that didn‚Äôt directly benefit him? They are fully comfortable taking from a woman to prop up his career. That is what she is for. However, career women will be forever disadvantaged because a man won‚Äôt cook, clean, wait for you while you go off to war, raise your kids and prop you up emotionally. This is why we should demand more. When we don‚Äôt demand partnership from men, none of us gets it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/kfqqjf/the_hypocrisy_of_career_men/,1608316306.0,686,0.95,107,FemaleDatingStrategy,GIfuckingJane

I sent her a drawing of a nude model (we both are artistic and exchanged several drawing before this)

Her: Ha, very cool. I know where you mind is going.

Me: Thanks! Hey Maybe we should do the sex talk :)

Her: What's the sex talk?

Me:  Well, it's essentially expressing our desires, preferences, goals,  boundaries , etc. Its just good to talk about this and manage  expectations.

Her: I don't think we are there yet. I'm not ready to share these things.

Me: That's fine, everyone has their own pace.
