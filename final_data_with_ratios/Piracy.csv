lwocgy,early episodes of the daily show are available nowhere but for a single torrent.,"not available for purchase or streaming in any form.

a couple years ago some redditors got together and stitched together all of the 2 minute clips they could find and they pieced together episodes starting in season 4 (when jon stewart took over the show from craig kilborn)

The series currently isn't available on any of the pirating streaming sites I've been looking through either. I'm writing this in hopes that  others will recognize how close we are to loosing these historical videos and help in our efforts to keep them alive. if you have any access to uploading them to streaming sites please do so. idk how the internet archive works or if that wouldn't be kosher with comedy central owning the videos.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I've been told that the episodes exist on a couple private trackers (btn and tvv) but I don't have access to those. I'm betting those might also be missing the kilborn episodes though, and might even be the same torrents missing clips from earlier seasons. 

2nd edit : I've learned of a Usenet version that might be better than the torrent I referenced. It's possible the Usenet version includes the missing segments and isn't just sliced together, but I believe it's also missing the kilborn episodes. I don't have access to Usenet, so I'd love if someone would download and compare them

l9exis,How to download books from Archive org and how to remove d r m protection of the downloaded book using Calibre,"Hello everyone… In this guide I’m going to show you how to download books from archive and how to remove drm protection of the downloaded book using Calibre. This guide is complete and it is based on: my own experience, some research I done, some help I got from others which I will provide the references…

In Summary, To download a book from archive, you need to be signed in to archive, then open the page of the book you want to download, Borrow the book either for 14 days or 1 hour, then you need to download the URLLINK.acsm that will be used by adobe digital edition to download the book as pdf… each book have its own URLLINK.acsm file… but the downloaded pdf book will have a drm protection meaning you can only open the book using adobe digital edition and you cannot edit it or anything like that… in later steps we will learn how to remove this drm using Calibre with a plugging for drm remove


PS: In Order for this to work, make sure you follow the mentioned steps to the letter, even it’s a lot of reading and stuff but once done right the first time, it will be much easier the 2nd time


Now lets get started:

A. First part: Preparation Steps you need to do before downloading the book:

1. Sign up and login to archive.org (very important step)
2. Now download adobe digital editions, it is a free pc software from adobe, just open this site and then download and install the software: [https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html)

Now the next thing you need to do after you install adobe digital edition, is to open the software and authorize your computer, in other terms login to your adobe digital edition account… In order to do that, start adobe digital edition program, then go to help and enter to Authorize Computer… Now here you have 2 options: either create and id with password, which you can do by pressing on create an adobe ID, OR you can skip this step by Pressing the mark at the bottom of the new popped window saying: ""i want to authorize my computer without an ID"" and press next… your done

3) As already stated the downloaded Book is DRM protected so you need to remove the DRM protection, For that you will need the next software installed: 1)Calibre 2)Plugin for Calibre that will remove the drm

Calibre is a free software used mainly to convert between different document formats like pdf, epub, mobi...

First, here how to download Calibre: 

To download calibre, go to this site: [https://calibre-ebook.com/](https://calibre-ebook.com/) then go to downloads and choose your operating system, here you can download either the latest version, or go to Previous releases of caliber where you can download earlier versions

PS: I highly recommend you to download calibre v4.23 instead of lastest version, cz it is confirmed that some people are having issues with calibre v5 not working with the drm remover pluggin

Second, Calibre supports many plugins, one of the plugins we need to add to calibre is the one for ""DRM-REMOVER"", so you need to download the plugin… Here is the link to download the plugin:

[https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/](https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/)

From this link you will find a link for github… Click on it… Which takes you to the download link…

You can download the latest version but i also recommend to download ""DeDRM plug-in 6.8.0"" instead of the latest version... Then extract the zip

Here is the guide to follow in order to add the plugin to caliber

You'll download a .zip file containing three folders and a readme.txt file; unzip them to a new folder on your desktop.

Now fire up Calibre, and click the large Preference button on the top menu far right hand side

Sometimes The preference button might be hidden so you need to click on the 3 small dots in a vertical position at the top right corner where you can find the preference menu

Then Select the ""Change Calibre behavior"" option, then scroll down to the advanced section before clicking on Plugins.

A new screen will pop up, and you need to click the ""Load plugin from file"" button at the bottom right corner.

Point the software to the folder you unzipped Alf's tools to, then click on the ""DeDRM\_calibre\_plugin"" folder.

Then highlight the ""DeDRM\_plugin.zip"" file, and hit the Open button. Click Yes when the virus warning starts up. Shut down Calibre, and then fire it up once more.

B. Second Part: how to download the books from Archive

For this part you must understand that any book available at archive, you need to borrow it first, then you need to download the URLLINK.acsm that will be used by adobe digital edition, that’s why it is very important to be signed in, and there are 2 types of borrow: 1) borrow the book for 14 days and 2) Borrow the book for 1 hour

1. borrow the book for 14 days: What you need to do is go to the archive page of the book you want then click on borrow the book for 14 days, then press on download PDF/ePub… Then press on download the book, i highly recommend to download the book as pdf not epub cz the epub version is mostly corrupted and have missing parts… then a file called URLLINK.acsm get downloaded to your pc, mainly to your download folder, it is very small like few kb, you will need this file in the next steps

PS: IF SOMEONE ELSE BORROWED THE BOOK FOR 14 DAYS, YOU CANNOT BORROW IT UNLIT HE/SHE RETURNS IT, OR THE 14 DAYS PERIODE EXPIRE

2\_ Borrow the book for 1 hour: these types of borrow does not have a download link on archive page like the 14 days borrowing period do, SO you cannot download URLLINK.acsm the usual way, but there is a work around it in order to be able to download the URLLINK.acsm file which will help us download the pdf book

So first make sure you click on borrow this book for 1 hour (very important step)

Next step, there is a spreadsheet (excel format) that can generate the download link for the URLLINK.acsm file of the book you want to download

Here is the link for the spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9JHIVEa6\_2cwpmxgUymF5OAoHZbXCO3Qh9gQVAHuR0/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9JHIVEa6_2cwpmxgUymF5OAoHZbXCO3Qh9gQVAHuR0/edit#gid=0)

A Big thanks to “u/look\_who\_it\_isnt” he was the one who provided me with the spreadsheet link

This link is for google so you need to be signed in to your Gmail in order to download this spreadsheet…

PS: Some people are having problems downloading the spreadsheet, not sure why, probably because the site is blocked in your country or probably because they are using phone or a mac laptop, so if any problem occurred I advise you not to use a phone like android or iphone, and not to use mac, instead use a laptop with windows installed, and use google chrome as your browser… in extreme cases just use a vpn if the site is blocked in your country

Then download the spreadsheet (excel)

In the extreme cases, if the spreadsheet (excel) could not be downloaded, I will teach you how to create your own download link for the URLLINK.acsm file, without the need for the spreadsheet, so here how to do it:

1. You must have already clicked ""Borrow for 1 hour"" and have Adobe Digital Editions installed and set up
2. From the URL of the Archive book, copy the Identifier. Example: For [https://archive.org/details/legalfoundations0000comm](https://archive.org/details/legalfoundations0000comm), the Identifier is ""legalfoundations0000comm""
3. Paste the Identifier into this next link by replacing the “XXXXXXXXXXXXX”

[https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media\_url&amp;identifier=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1](https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&amp;identifier=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1)

So the New link would be:

[https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media\_url&amp;identifier=legalfoundations0000comm&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1](https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&amp;identifier=legalfoundations0000comm&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1)

Another example for this:

Archive link: [https://archive.org/details/pasta0000unse\_m6m5](https://archive.org/details/pasta0000unse_m6m5)

Identifier: pasta0000unse\_m6m5

URLLINK.acsm download file link: [https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media\_url&amp;identifier=pasta0000unse\_m6m5&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1](https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&amp;identifier=pasta0000unse_m6m5&amp;format=pdf&amp;redirect=1)

Now open the URLLINK.acsm link you got in your browser, anda file called URLLINK.acsm get downloaded to your pc, also mainly to your download folder, which you will need it in the next steps

After the URLLINK.acsm is downloaded open it with adobe digital edition, and let it download the whole book you want as pdf file. the downloaded pdf file usually you can find it at C:/Users/your.pc.username/Documents/MyDigitalEdition… as already stated the downloaded book is DRM protected so you need to remove the DRM protection… In order to do so, open calibre, then add your pdf file, that you want to remove the DRM from, to calibre, then calibre will automatically remove the drm using the plugin that was already added to calibre

And that's it You can find the pdf file without the DRM protection at this location: C:\\Users\\your.pc.username\\CalibreLibrary Good luck


Most people tried it and worked for them, so if it worked for you, make sure to leave a comment bellow, and if it didn’t, please mention your problem in detail in the comments and what did you do step by step so we can help you out and so others can learn too


UPDATE1: if anyonw would like to download the images of the book for higher quality, here how to do it:

UPDATE2: another way you can download the images straight from the archive viewer, is by saving the whole page on your desktop, you can do that by pressing on ctrl+S which will save the web page as html, and with it comes a folder which contain the images pages

But this will only save the last few pages you have viewed of the book, just make sure you zoom the page to your preferences, cz the more you zoom in, the more the saved images will be better in quality... but it is very time consuming, not recommended, just use a cache viewer as described in the link provided in update 1",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/l9exis/how_to_download_books_from_archive_org_and_how_to/,1612108292.0,239,0.96,83,Piracy,silentshot546

juy3dn,"[RANT] The movie industry cries about muh piracy, yet seems to be completely incapable of providing a decent legal alternative","First let's look at the other entertainment industries:  

* **Music:** CD albums are in 99% cases DRM-free, there are hundred sites where you can easily buy and then download albums or singles in multiple formats and every streaming service has +/- the same library.  

* **Games:** Steam is great while other platforms are decent, there multiple sites selling keys, GOG is DRM-free, games are on sale all the God damn time, subscription-based services exist and the cloud gaming is a thing.  

And now let's look at the movie industry:  

1. 4K Blu-rays are expensive as balls in most countries and pretty much never being discounted. Oh and they're DRMed to all hell and it is actually a crime to circumvent DRM.  
1. Online DRM-free distribution doesn't exist AFAIK. Every purchase on Amazon, iTunes etc is locked to this platform, you have to watch it using this platform and if this platform is ever discontinued? Tough shit  
1. Streaming services... Dear lord are they getting worse and worse every year. Oh you want to watch ""X""? It's on Netflix. ""Y"" after that maybe? Well, this one's on Amazon Prime. Oh and ""Z"" is on Hulu. Or maybe not because shit's always rotating so you'll never know! Fuck off  

I've pretty much stopped pirating music and games years ago, but yet again started downloading the sweet sweet BD Remuxes. 4TB HDD costs ~50 bucks.

I have xfinity gigabit internet (1 gig download/40 mb upload) and it also keeps dipping in quality throughout as well. I am lucky to have this free month + 14 days from them due to an offer from labor day but I am not paying $8/month until they fix their servers. It is either funimation servers are so bad or that xfinity is throttling funimation. I doubt xfinity is throttling that would had affected other services too so it has to be funimation servers are so crappy. Yes I would like to eventually pay for funimation but that's only if they actually try. No wonder they only have 5 million subscribers they suck.

So after I downloaded, I realized it was fake and just a virus by looking at the size of the file, and icon design of the .exe file. So I didn't open it. But I forgot to delete from my desktop page, I just left the file to be stored there.

After I rebooted my computer the next day, and few hours later, something similar popped up: [https://i.ibb.co/C6MFVcF/e1c7497f-a876-4eac-8918-ad7eacf02ab2.png](https://i.ibb.co/C6MFVcF/e1c7497f-a876-4eac-8918-ad7eacf02ab2.png)

huwyfi,"What people get wrong about copyrights, VPNs, and ISPs.","I felt compelled to write this owing to the chronic torrent of misconceptions or outright bullshit I encounter on this subreddit on a regular basis.  I do so for no other reason than to make sure people understand the risks they are taking principally with Bittorrent.  This is true for the United States, and much of it is applicable at least to Canada.

I don't pretend to be an expert but several years back I was forced to follow this issue because I was threatened with a lawsuit for something I didn't remember torrenting.  The file in question was a pornographic video with a generic description.  I did not have the file on my hard drive when I got the letter, so either they got it wrong, or I deleted it.  I honestly don't know.  This was part of the Prenda - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenda\_Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenda_Law) \- copyright trolling scheme which ended ignominiously with disbarments, massive fines, and a death.   The short of it was, this law firm was actively seeding content it owned on public trackers, and then suing people who connected to the swarms.  When this was revealed, it did not go over well for them.  In the end, no suit was ever filed against me but I did receive several letters from the law firm, including a settlement proposition of $4k or so.  Having stressed out about it for a few days I decided to fight it, in large part because one of the schemes of pornography copyright trolls is to threaten to sue you over something really embarrassing, and where they fucked up (as they were early in their scheme and hadn't fully figured it out yet) is trying to sue someone over a fairly innocuous-sounding title; something mainstream and not very embarrassing.  But it never came to that.

The first thing to understand first of all is that most copyright problems are torts - civil suits from studios who own copyrights.  Your ISP is involved only to the extent that the studio will subpoena your identity based on your IP address at a certain time if the copyright holder can convince the court to compel them to do so.  The rest takes place in civil court.  If you're thinking about the government getting on your case, you're worrying about the wrong thing.  That six strike thing (or whatever yours is) is the ISP acting in good faith to stop chronic pirates because they do not want to be involved in the process of copyright enforcement - legislatively, or being compelled to legally in any other matter.  This keeps the copyright holders off of their back.

In most cases your ISP will get a notification, and then look up who you are in their logs, and then forward it to you, without informing the copyright holder as to who you are -- that is, unless and until they are compelled to by subpoena.  And yes, this does happen, and has happened, and will continue to happen.

Secondly, you're being sued not for downloading something but, as a member of a swarm, uploading parts of it to your peers in the swarm.  It's the reciprocal nature of Bittorrent that is the problem.  From what I've seen, broadly, in the case of things like direct downloads, they're interested in the person hosting/sharing, not the downloader.  So too with bittorrent.  What they want to do is prove you were involved in uploading data to others and thereby facilitating piracy.  So it's not the download, it's the upload, that they trigger on.

Thirdly, it's not about how much you download but \*what\* you download.  It is usually not the big budget Hollywood blockbusters that will wind up with you in the middle of a lawsuit, oddly.  It's movies like The Hurt Locker - see [https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/10/technology/bittorrent\_lawsuits/index.htm](https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/10/technology/bittorrent_lawsuits/index.htm) \-  and pornography, the idea being that these represent \*revenue streams\* to the less wealthy studios in question.

Fourth, though they can sue you for $150,000 per infringement and they may scare you with this, what so-called copyright trolls tend to do is calculate about what it would cost you in legal and paperwork fees, and make you a settlement offer just under that amount ($3500-$5000 or so).  In the case of particularly embarrassing pornography, they figure people aren't going to want that to be in the public record.  In the case of film studios, they know their size can scare people.  Legally, however, they can sue you for up to $150,000.

What you need to understand when you receive a copyright infringement notice is whether or not it is a letter from your ISP merely telling you they've received a letter from a studio.  The studio alerting your ISP may or may not subpoena your contact information based on the IP address they logged.  (They usually do not, which is why you keep hearing people saying they've received tons of these and nothing has happened.)

If they do subpoena it and your ISP doesn't fight it, or loses that fight, the copyright holder may then mail you directly or call you.  If this happens \*say nothing and admit to nothing.\*  They will be either recording the call or recording what you say for use against you later.

\*Do not say someone hacked your WiFi router.\*  Everyone says this - everyone - and is an indication you're playing defense.  Say nothing, commit to nothing.  Tell them to stop contacting you and to contact your legal representation.  It may well be true that an IP address does not equate to a person, but it will not stop them from dragging you into court and arguing about it.  Depending on your judge, and your lawyer, you may prevail early on this count but it really is going to depend on where the lawsuit is happening and what other evidence they have.  I have seen them produce WiFi coverage maps of residences where it was unlikely any neighbor could have connected to your access point.  They are prepared for the ""someone hacked my WiFi"" excuse.

\*\*Remember:\*\* in a civil case you're dealing with preponderance of evidence, not ""reasonable doubt.""  Reliance on ""reasonable doubt"" is completely misplaced in civil cases in the United States. They do not need to prove you are the IP address they logged; they must merely offer it in the pile of evidence they will amass against you.

\*\*If you delete the file in question in the hopes that this will protect you\*\*, you may also be charged with \*spoliation of evidence\* and all of the attorneys I have ever seen comment on this issue insist you should not do this.  I am not a lawyer and won't tell you what to do but ""delete everything"" seems to be the most common piece of advice you see when this situation arises, and it may be terrible advice.

\*\*If you get a letter from the court, do not ignore it.\*\*  Ignoring the court or not showing up for court dates could result in a default judgment against you and it could be the full amount, $150,000.  You need to look carefully at anything you receive in the mail to determine whether or not you are legally compelled to answer, and you may be.

\*\*What VPNs can do for you:\*\*

As you all should know by now, a VPN can claim it doesn't log, can claim it doesn't cooperate with local authorities, and so forth.   The reality may be very different and the solidity of a VPN is based exclusively on reputation.

What a VPN can help you with is to \*\*not be low-hanging fruit.\*\*

Low-hanging fruit - that is, the people who are most easy to sue, are people torrenting without a VPN in a jurisdiction which is friendly to these sorts of suits (much of North America).  You will actually see copyright trolls shop their cases around, state-to-state, depending on their chances of success in one state or another.  By using a VPN, especially by crossing international borders, you become \*a pain in the ass to them\*, and therefore, not a low-hanging fruit.  A potential suit against you involves convincing a foreign government to issue a subpoena to the VPN provider to tell them what originating IP you used (if they even log it/store it - they may, and they may actually be required to do so by law.  You need to research this before signing up with a VPN provider).  And then from there they must pursue it through your ISP.  This is one of the reasons there's so much discussion about the legal environments VPN providers operate in.  Are foreign governments friendly or unfriendly to such suits?  For now, it has not been worth it with all of the people torrenting without VPNs out there to sue and collect money from.  It is sort of like speeding on the highway: the best way to do this is to allow cars going faster than you want to to pass, and have them attract police attention before they notice you.  People who torrent without VPNs are low-hanging fruit.  Like the speeders in front of you, they attract the most attention from lawsuit-happy copyright holders.

As for seedboxes, perhaps someone else could comment.  In theory they could subpoena a seedbox provider for your IP, and then try to contact your ISP and subpoena them.  How this argument would work legally I do not know.

What I do know is that torrenting copyrighted material without a VPN in the USA and Canada at least is like fucking without a condom.  Your record so far of not getting an STI is no indication of what may happen in the future.

And trust me, it sucks to be one of the unlucky ones.  Best tip is to not upload even chunks of copyrighted content via Bittorrent or otherwise.  But even if the case against you is weak and you think you'll prevail, remember that it costs money and time to fight this in court.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/huwyfi/what_people_get_wrong_about_copyrights_vpns_and/,1595289888.0,175,0.95,46,Piracy,Dr_William_H_Cosby

I try to understand how the Rockstar Launcher DRM (especially for Red Dead Redemption 2) works and why it’s so hard to crack for scene groups..

In the past months I’ve read some news that the Rockstar Games Launcher version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas got cracked and also there’s the SocialClub Emulator by Mr\_Goldberg which cracks / bypasses SC which was also used to crack the latest version of GTA V.

So what is the difference between these two games and the uncracked RDR2 ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/h0j17y/red_dead_redemption_2_drm/,1591819750.0,393,0.95,85,Piracy,d3crypti0n

g23u22,Kodi 18.6 + IAGL = Netflix For Retro Game Streaming,"Here is a step by step guide on how you can configure Kodi 18.6 to play thousands tons of ROMS direct from the Internet Archive.

&amp;nbsp;

### Software needed

* Install Kodi 18.6 from [here](https://kodi.tv/download)
* Use downloader to download the Internet Archive Games Launcher from [here](https://github.com/zach-morris/repository.zachmorris/raw/master/repository.zachmorris/repository.zachmorris-1.0.0.zip)

&amp;nbsp;
### Steps



* Pair a Bluetooth controller (I used my Shield TV Pro controller)



* Start Kodi 18.6

* Go to settings --- system --- input
 - Configure your gamepad here (to add a virtual coin on MAME/Arcade, you need to map the select button)
* Navigate to Settings --- Addons --- Install from zip file

* Select external storage

* Select the Downloader folder (or wherever you downloaded the zip file from)

* Select the zach morris repo zip file

* Click on Install from repository

* Choose the Zach Morris Addons

* Go to Game addons

* Go to Game providers

* Install Internet Archive Game Launcher
 * Click on configure and you can set the size of cache (by default no games are stored and are only downloaded as and when you want to play them). If you are going to be playing 8/16bit games then as they are fairly small, you set the cache to 1GB which will be enough for a few thousand games.
 * Select ""Execute Setup Wizard""
 * Say ""No"" for ""Do you have an archive.org account""

* Open the Internet Archive Game Launcher

* You can now browse by category / all lists. Any game you choose, will automatically be downloaded and you can choose one of the built in Kodi emulators to run them.

&amp;nbsp;

**The main thing is you don't need to download any ROMS in advance, everything you choose will be downloaded on demand.**

Enjoy classic Retro gaming😊


##### EDIT (added FAQ with comments/messages received) 
&amp;nbsp;
# FAQ 
**Does this work on a Xbox?**

- Short answer - No
- Long answer - Microsoft does not allow emulators on the Store, so if Kodi wants to stay on the store it can't have support for any emulation features in the UWP version

**So where else can I use this?** 

 - I've personally tested this with success on my Nvidia Shield, 4K Firestick, Windows 10 PC. I would say its a safe bet that this process will work on any device that supports Kodi (except Xbox)

**Do I have to stream the ROMs? What if I want to save them??** 

 - The default cache size is 0, which means only the current game will be saved. You can increase the cache size to something bigger. What you choose depends on what kind of games you play and how often you play them. 8/16bit games are only a few mb. CD based systems are easily over 500MB per game

**Why can't I play N64 / Dreamcast games**? 

- Two popular retro consoles are not currently supported in Kodi 18: the Sega Dreamcast and the N64. N64 and the Dreamcast cores both require OpenGL support, which is not currently included in the Retroplayer framework.
**Is there any way to play N64 / Dreamcast and other advanced emulators?** 
 - Yes, you can configure IAGL to use Retroarch as an external emulator. This means when you select a game, instead of Kodi Retroplayer opening it, a command will be sent to Retroarch to launch the downnloaded game. 

**Do you have a video showing gameplay?** Yes, you can [see that here](https://youtu.be/-2wYuWbPhqc?t=47s)

g0rs0j,Do you pirate for the sake of accumulation?,"One of the best things about piracy is how I've been able to build my own abundant collection of films and tv shows. I get a sense of satisfaction, not just from being able to watch all this content ""for free"", but by being able to acquire it for free in the first place. Say, a film that looks interesting that has been in the cinemas for a while. Once it becomes available to torrent, I can acquire in such a simple manner. Within a few minutes - an hour BAM! It's on my external hard drive for me to consumer at a later date. This isn't quite hoarding, which is hoovering up any ol thing you can find. But accumulating my own collection of content - films, tv shows, music - that I really want feels very satisfying, almost like I have accomplished something.

g0hx69,"Deezloader has been killed, no more updates forever... in favour of a new downloader","Focus is now being put into deemix, a python based downloader, with a promising UI. Unfortunately Deezloader is now deprecated, only the recent XSS issue was fixed, and only by my request. The final version is now 4.4.0, any bugs left will not be fixed.

For Android, the downloader to use now is AIDS by the same guy who was updating the Deezloader Remix Mobile port.

For desktop users, the new downloader deemix is the replacement, but it is no way near complete. Unless you code JavaScript and are willing to sift through the garbage code of Deezloader Remix, your issues will not be fixed.

The reason is that the code for Deezloader has become extremely convoluted and matches the definiton of spaghetti quite well, and maintaining it has been difficult for RemixDev. 

Unfortunately, the Deezloader Remix Community group on telegram is about to be killed, and deemix will not have a new one because that group on telegram basically became unmoderated (the moderators literally ignored a hugely NSFW image!!) and it was 99% spam, and any messages were covered by junk stickers.

Not gonna lie, it's pretty easy.

* We'll use **Maximum Action** as an example (release took from IGG)
* After downloading it. You'll have the [following files](https://archive.is/o/xM1X1/https://files.catbox.moe/b2s2xx.png).
* Open **Maximum Action.exe** with a hex editor (I'll use **HxD**).
* **CTRL F ""IGG""**, you should see [this.](https://archive.is/o/xM1X1/https://files.catbox.moe/912vos.png)
* [Highlight the whole DRM](https://archive.is/o/xM1X1/https://files.catbox.moe/pqa2oa.png) (hex values until you hit 0).
* [Right click and fill selection with zeros](https://archive.is/o/xM1X1/https://files.catbox.moe/o9topb.png).

There you go, you have removed IGG's DRM.

*EDIT :The DRM blocks you from playing the game without having their shitty needed redirects/links they put in the directories of games, by removing this DRM, it allows you to have a clean version without IGG's shit.EDIT 2 : Thanks for the silver and the gold, much appreciated &lt;3*

8yjv8e,DO NOT USE OCEAN OF GAMES!!!,"I downloaded a game from their website called ""Tomato Way""

It comes with a VBE file that ""decodes"" the archive into an iso.

WHEN INFACT IT PUTS MALWARE ONTO YOUR PC AND LITERALLY RENAMES A DLL WHICH IS THE ISO TO AN ISO.

The VBE was encrypted, although was able to decrypt it with [https://master.ayra.ch/vbs/vbs.aspx](https://master.ayra.ch/vbs/vbs.aspx)

Here is a screenshot of the VBE and what it does:

[https://imgur.com/a/hCMhzly](https://imgur.com/a/hCMhzly)

If you don't believe me, download this game, decode the VBE and see for yourself.

The file it infects you with is another VBE, which opens a silent window of a malicious site (update your pc . info) (DO NOT VISIT)

[https://imgur.com/a/ZPtqQH1](https://imgur.com/a/ZPtqQH1)

It first tries to do it in chrome. Then tries to do it in firefox.

Be careful when downloading games. If you get a vbs, or bat, make sure to decode it and READ WHAT IT DOES FIRST.

The actual game and installer appears to be clean though. It's just this ""unpacker"" that is infected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8yjv8e/do_not_use_ocean_of_games/,1531487659.0,99,0.94,60,Piracy,yotoprules

8wou03,How my friend got in trouble for hosting Floatplane rips + a visit from LTT,"This happened a few months ago, but I thought I would share it now with /r/Piracy

So my friend is this guy who is super advanced with servers, VPSes, hosting, ect. He set up a Floatplane rips site for watching videos from Linus Tech Tips before they were released. I remember him asking me and other people on Discord to promote his website, even asking for @everyone. I didn't promote his site, I didn't want to get into any issues with Discord's ToS.

Well, the REAL Luke from Linus Tech Tips (yes, legit), joined our server (well, it wasn't mine, my friend was a ""Helper"" in the server, and I was a normal member. the server was big with almost 3,000 members when it happened). He joined the voice chat and starting talking to my friend (and all the staff, members, ect in the voice chat). All I remember him saying is how he tracked him down (he said it was very easy), and that if he was over 18+ (he was about 16 i think) that he could be charged as an adult, ect. Luckily he was very chill, and my friend took down the Floatplane rips website. It was actually a good time, he wasn't as mad with us. He ended up leaving his alt in the server.

And before you say I'm bullshitting, I made a recording:  [4\_qUNZo5LJo](https://youtu.be/4_qUNZo5LJo) (just the video ID)

Looking back it's a funny story, my friend was so stupid, but at least he wasn't fined or some shit.\]

**Today someone posted about it in their online forum and that post was promptly removed**  

This seemed to be happening only when I downloaded a movie or two (around 2-4 GB) the day prior. Otherwise the RG would be shown to be ""up"". As you all know, downloading 2-4 GB per DAY is *nothing* in this day and age when people download 50-100 GB a day without batting an eyelid.  

Anyway, to confirm my suspicion, I decided to get a group of my friends who had their own Real-Debrid subscriptions and check to see whether the SAME set of hosters would be shown to be non-functional for all of us at the same time.  

**We were stunned to  see a HUGE discrepancy !**  

The hosters that were shown to be down were **DIFFERENT** for all of us (or at least for most of us).  

I was on a 90-day subscription. For me, it showed MOST of the hosters to be **down**. Especially RAPIDGATOR was shown to be down.  

For my friend whose subcription was expiring in a couple of days, MOST of the Hosters were shown to be **up** ! *INCLUDING the RAPIDGATOR* !  


Same patterns were apparent for many of my friends.  

**So we could all figure out that the RD guys only bothered to make their services available *SELECTIVELY* to their subscribers who were reaching the end of their subscription  period and simply THROTTLED the download speed or otherwise showed the hosters to be DOWN for those of us who had many days remaining in our subscriptions !**


We all took screenshots and compared them amongst ourselves.  

This is how bad MY list of non-functional hosters looks at this point of time :( : https://imgur.com/a/uwjwa5p  


I would like to encourage all the reader's to also kindly paste the screenshots of what they see, so that this scam can be exposed :(  


**If anyone  posts anything even MILDLY detrimental in the way of saying that a hoster is down in their forum, they promptly remove that post to avoid others getting wind of this scam**  

So please guys, post your screenshots here so that we can all compare !

==================================================================================

**EDIT:**  
Thank you very,very much guys for the response ! I am overwhelmed !! Thank you ! Just a few notes :

I did not ""use up"" my quota or anything for the Hosters.  

**Please see my downloaded traffic details** : https://i.imgur.com/L6r1CVd.png  


I have been a member with even this same account for *over a year.*  

See my **payment history** : https://imgur.com/a/fa5xsQ1  

=================================================================================  


**I would like to request this from the RD guys :**  

* Do not delete our messages from the RD forum as soon as we post them !  

* Make the list of non-working hosters visible even without the need to login with a premium account  

**Why should the RD guys HIDE the list of the hosters that are down , making them visible ONLY to those logged in with a premium account ???**  

==================================================================================
==================================================================================

**UPDATE on 30May2018** (The next day after I posted this thread) :  

Screenshot of Non-Working Hosters today for me : https://imgur.com/jCb3crv  

As you can see, the Rapidgator is DOWN. This seems to be something SYSTEMATIC that the RD guys are doing rather than a random/technical issue.

Thank you all who took the trouble to post the screenshots !

79bg64,I made a Chrome extension that automatically hides fake torrents on The Pirate Bay based on conditional logic,"I wrote a script about [a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/4w0qix/now_that_kat_is_gone_i_wrote_a_small_script_that/) that removed fake torrents from TPB that a lot of people found helpful. Since then, a lot of adblockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus) started blocking jQuery on TPB which the old script was reliant on. Last week, I rewrote the script to use vanilla Javascript which fixed the issue. In that post though, I had someone suggest I make it into a Chrome extension, and I'm happy to say I was able to deliver on that.

&amp;nbsp;

Just published to the Chrome Web Store, you can now download the extension (for free of course) from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-fake-torrents-on-tpb/fkdhkcpmifehkmadpldbbdadepgplcmo). All the new features of the new script such as the ability to hide porn, french torrents, as well as cams and telesyncs are also available in the extension.

&amp;nbsp;

For a refresher of why I made this script / extension in the first place, I'll repost a part of original post which explains this in detail:

*One of the things I've noticed after having to use Pirate Bay for a while, is the significant amount of fake torrents. For example if you browse the HD Movies section and sort by seeds, (depending on when their bot ran) you'll see a [ton of untrusted torrents](http://puu.sh/qngwb.png) with an unrealistic amount of seeds.*

*The script has a couple options to get rid of these. The default behaviour is to hide untrusted torrents (torrents without the little pink or green skulls) if they have more than 1000 seeds.*

&amp;nbsp;

A screenshot of the Chrome extension in action can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/qeRNRhd.png), and a few more screenshots are also available on the Chrome Web Store [listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-fake-torrents-on-tpb/fkdhkcpmifehkmadpldbbdadepgplcmo). If anyone has any ideas or suggestions for the extension, I'd love to hear them!

&amp;nbsp;

dey29m,An argument for MP3s: A pirate's story,"In light of the news article that was posted here yesterday (""Music piracy continues to drop dramatically, but the industry hates to admit that because it ruins the narrative."") I want to say that I still have +21,000 MP3s. All 320kbps. It's a collection I've been building since the wild west of pirating (Napster, late 90's) and I add to it monthly.

It takes up 140GB of space, which I keep backed up in several places, and on a 200GB microSD card on my phone.

The comments everyone always gives me is- why? When streaming is so cheap, why do I still do it? Here's my take on it.

1) Streaming music uses data. So, besides needing a signal (often hard to get while camping, boating, or inside some buildings) you also have to *pay* for that data. I don't even know what unlimited data plans cost anymore- I have a $20/month Republic Wireless phone with 1 GB of data, and that's all I need.

2) Streaming music quality sucks. Yep, I said it. Compare a 320Kbps local mp3 file with a streaming track on hi-fidelity speakers or headphones, you'll hear that familiar fuzzy sound of compressed highs and lifeless mids on the stream. Even in the car, there is a notable difference between streaming from Spotify on my kid's phone versus playing an mp3 from my phone that even my children point out.

3) Streaming music doesn't have a complete selection. Over the years, I have had to hunt down rare tracks that aren't on any streaming service. Especially movie soundtracks- want to listen to Mark Mancina's score to ""Speed"" or ""Twister"". You're not going to find it on Spotify. What about Tangerine Dream's score for ""Legend""? Nope. Hell, even Amazon Music doesn't have that. ***But I do.*** I've done 2 decades worth of online searches, getting old CDs from libraries, yard sales, and digging through friends/family's boxes of unplayed CD collections to get some of my tracks. Give this collection up for streaming? Fuck no.

And with the money I save on not streaming and minimal data plans, I do give back. I go to concerts all the time, and over the years I have bought many CDs to rip when that was the only option to get the music I was looking for. Also, I actively support artists I like by buying merch.

In then end, the people who are getting fucked are big telecoms because I won't buy their data plans, Spotify/iTunes because I won't pay for that service, and record labels because I am not giving them a 90% cut over the artists.

ddvj8g,Do any of you still go to the cinema even though you pirate?,"For me pirating movies via torrents have basically replaced the role that DVD's and Blu-ray would have. It definitely saves a lot of space that I can have my entire film collection on my hard drive instead of taking up space on shelves. However, I still do go to the cinema to watch new films because I still think the experience of watching a film ""in the cinema"" is still valuable but I'll just torrent them when they come out on Blu-ray and someone has ripped it. Plus it is still technically supporting the industry and content creators, albeit very indirectly. I do not understand how people can watch those CAM rips that are usually of poor quality and for me isn't a good experience to watch. I understand if for some folks there isn't a cinema near them for miles and tickets are expensive so a CAM rip is the best they've got to catch up on the latest films.

dbug93,I Know What You Download - Monitoring Tool,"I thought i might bring this to the attention of those who haven't yet got acquainted with this powerful tool.

[https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/)

I have been using it on occasion, for almost a year now. It has been proven useful in the past. Both on researching and creeping on others. Eh eh xD I wanna know who has the same bizarre tastes than i do! :D

[https://torrentfreak.com/i-know-what-you-downloaded-on-bittorrent-161223/](https://torrentfreak.com/i-know-what-you-downloaded-on-bittorrent-161223/)[https://fossbytes.com/i-know-what-you-downlaod-bittorent-history/](https://fossbytes.com/i-know-what-you-downlaod-bittorent-history/)

You can extract a single, multiple or all the peers and seeds from your client (uTorrent) by hovering and right-clicking ""Copy Peer List"" (all) or ""Copy Selected Hosts"" (single or multiple) and investigate them.

First, you need to convert the host address with the aid of [https://www.ip-tracker.org/](https://www.ip-tracker.org/) or [https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/) (if it's not listed on the 1st).

Use [https://iphub.info/](https://iphub.info/) in order to determine whether you are dealing with a proxy or a residential IP.

So, any useful tips &amp; tricks, or stories you guys wanna share? I found it to be somewhat easy to uncover someone's IP, just by knowing where target is from, his tastes and past torrents. Or finding useful content, sources and access to interesting stats.

Please note that you should deviate from any form of harassment. This shows how important it is to protect yourself, if nothing else, for your privacy. Private trackers aren't listed in here.  


Update: If you click on a torrent, you can see every single IP logged to it, sorted by country of origin. Such as this FIFA 19 - CPY. Click on a country.

d7a5wo,Radarr is tracking your clicks on its web interface,"I'm curious if other Radarr users know this, but every click inside its web interface sends potentially sensitive information to the authors' private servers. This information includes:

* Your public IP address

* Your web browser 

* Your screen resolution

* The version of the software you are using

* **The URL clicked in the web interface**

I highlighted the last one because when you click on a movie in Radarr, the movie name is visible in the URL. Hence, browsing around your library inside Radarr, you are firing off information about your movie library to an unknown server which is detailed enough to fingerprint you. Note that this can be mitigated by using an ad blocker (which isn't always possible on mobile devices).

You can verify this for yourself by using the ""Network"" tab inside Chrome dev tools, and filtering for ""piwik"", which appears to be the analytics software they are using.

I certainly didn't expect to discover this, given the self-hosted nature of Radarr, and I'd bet a lot of other people would be surprised to find this out too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/d7a5wo/radarr_is_tracking_your_clicks_on_its_web/,1569070686.0,107,0.89,33,Piracy,Bspammer

Over the past few days, I've been at it improving the sub. Most notably the index of piracy sites. The previous owner Hugix (Great guy) used to stash sites in the wiki. I found this hard to navigate and compare. I made a Google Sheet with a partially migrated wiki and a site list a user of the community provided. Check this out on our sub!

I've updated the theme and fleshed out our new.reddit page as along with our old.reddit page. Automod does more things now, and I've just recently implemented a a flair system similar to how /r/jailbreak handles problem/solved posts.

I plan to release a discord server purely for notifying the community about releases from HorribleSubs (The main team that releases weekly episodes) with a bot. This bot allows users to subscribe to episodes so the moment they release, they are given a torrent file. 


And with another bot that is able to fetch search results from Nyaa Torrents. This I hope to better allow people who are inexperienced at torrenting to be able to search or have someone help search for torrents all on discord. 

I also plan to implement guides/FAQ in the wiki for quick reference. I released the Subs first official Guide a few hours ago.

&amp;#x200B;

\[educational purposes only\]

I found a method to extract epub file from Pearson eText through the use of the Android app. This method requires a rooted Android device (or if you have some way of accessing root through adb or smth). Not sure if this works similarly on IOS but if you have a way to view filesystem on jailbroken IOS devices it might.

&amp;#x200B;

You can get a free 14 day trial for Pearson etexts when you register a course and log in with your account. Do this (or if you already bought the book you dont have to). Download the android app ""eText"" from Pearson, log in, and download the book you have on 14 day trial.

&amp;#x200B;

Using a file browser that can explore root such as solid explorer, go to root/data/data/com.pearsoned.etext2he/AQUA/. In this folder should be a folder for each book you own, named with a sequence of numbers and letters. (You can find out which book is which by opening the folder and reading the json files for the book title.

PS:

* I'm aware of Boot Manager, but I believe it doesn't work anymore on Android 9.
* I'm also aware that some of these tweaks make my device less secure (root, xposed, sellinux mode for viper etc) but to me the tweaks are worth it by far!

But all these pirated contents are not open to the entire world. To download files from their site, you have to register for a premium account on Icerbox (\~$22/month). Lots of people don't want to pay that amount of money for just downloading a few files or just a few books. I were in that situation too and I know..., so I've created a tool that allows you guys to download FREE books posted on Avaxhome. Go to [dlfeb.com](https://dlfeb.com) and check it out.

cym1x4,A quick-and-dirty Python script to convert any ebook to a PDF,"Unfortunately, many types of ebooks are immune to DRM removal (for instance, see https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cy2dds/amazons_forcing_the_kindle_reader_program_to_be/ )

So rather than mucking around with DRM stuff I thought a better way would be to write a simple script which would automatically take a screenshot of each page and put them all into a PDF. 

There are a few cons, namely that you lose OCR and the PDF quality is dependent on the resolution of your monitor, but overall it's a good solution when you can't break the DRM imo. 

Also, it ostensibly works on both OSX and Windows 10 (not Linux, sorry), but I have only tested it on OSX. 

With that said, here is the script itself

---
    from PIL import Image, ImageGrab
    from pyautogui import press
    import time
    
    book_length = 100  # How many pages is your book
    cover_location = ""Cover.png""  # Specify the name of the cover picture (make sure it is a .png)
    
    # IMPORTANT: Manually specify the dimensions for your screenshot
    X1 = 488
    Y1 = 87
    X2 = 950
    Y2 = 800
    
    
    # You have 5 seconds to switch to the textbook. Make sure you start on the cover page
    time.sleep(5)
    
    box = (X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
    im_list = []
    cover = Image.open(cover_location).convert(""RGB"")
    
    for i in range(0, book_length):
        press(""down"")  # Assuming the down arrow key switches between pages
        # Change to press(""right"") if right arrow key works instead, and so on.
    
        time.sleep(1)  # arbitrary delay between screenshots
        im = ImageGrab.grab(bbox=box).convert('RGB')
        im_list.append(im)
    
    cover.save(""Textbook.pdf"", ""PDF"", resolution=100.0, save_all=True, append_images=im_list)

---

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to actually use it.

1. If you don't have it installed already, make sure to download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
2. Next, you're going to want to download the external libraries this uses, Pillow and PyAutoGUI. See: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/, https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html, and https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html 

3. Make a new folder somewhere. Save the script as a .py file there. See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Creating_Python_Programs

4. Take a screenshot of the first page of your ebook, name it ""Cover.png"" and place it into the folder you made. 

5. Open the .py file and replace the 100 in ""book_length = 100"" with however long your ebook is.

6. Set the dimensions of your screenshots. You do this by using a program such as snipping tool on windows or CMD-Shift-4 on OSX. Replace the X1, Y1 values with the coordinates of the top left of the ebook and the X2, Y2 with the coordinates of the bottom right. 

7. Ensure that pressing the down arrow key moves to the next page. If it doesn't, change "" press(""down"") "" to the correct key (for instance, if the right arrow key worked instead, it'd be press(""right"") ). 

8. Run the program then switch back to the cover page of the ebook. After a few seconds, it should be flipping through a page every second or so. 

9. Wait for the program to complete. If everything worked out, you should have a complete pdf named ""Textbook.pdf"" in the folder you made

10. Last but not least, upload your book to Libgen using username: **genesis**, password: **upload**

That should be everything. Hopefully this helps someone. Feel free to PM me if you have any problems with this.

Edit: Also, it occurs to me that one could buy an ebook, turn it into a pdf, then return the ebook (assuming it's not on Libgen in the first place).

cxbn33,PSA | Ransomware (All Current Vegas Pro 17 Torrents),"Well, buddy, if you're reading this, ya got me!

It took several years, but ya finally crept past my vigilance.

Congratulations, and fuck you.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, on to the actual post.

&amp;#x200B;

**How it happened:**

I decided I wanted to upgrade from Vegas Pro 14, to Vegas Pro 17. And being the broke millinial that I am, I would have to forgo this months rent to buy the new thing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I stopped by my neighborhood TPB, and picked up a copy of Vegas Pro 17, complete with an activator.

&amp;#x200B;

All seems fine, the activator worked. I've made a few vids, and am LOVING the speed in which Vegas Pro 17 renders (GPU Rendering = 1000x faster, compared to CPU Rendering used in VP 14).

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I notice my porn folder on my 3TB drive is filled with .ADAME files. And my girl Asa Akira is on her knees, begging me to pay the ransom so I can see her again.

&amp;#x200B;

So I slap her booty, like a boss, and tell her to wait while I dig around in my system to find out what dafuq is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**After much research, re-formating, and trying to replicate the problem, here's what I found:**

* The infection was caused by the Activator, which silently installs malware that downloads various things at random. Sometimes it's Worms, sometimes it's more Malware, sometimes it's a Trojan, sometimes it's just an annoying advertising bug that plays invisible video ads with the Redneck Advertising Guy who kills your brain cells with every syllable (runs alongside Anonymizer Gadget).
* Upon replicating the problem, I discovered that it was my bad luck that got me the ransomware. 9/10 times, it just worms.
* The virus installer doesn't kick in until you start a torrent client. Meaning that this is either a bait-and-switch tactic, or the installer itself uses the protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

**About the Ransomware**

* The files are encrypted in alphabetical order. Meaning that each file within a folder will be encrypted before moving on to the next folder. So if (Folder A &gt; File A, File B, File C), then all will be encrypted before encrypting (Folder B &gt; File A, File B, File C), and so on.
* Also, each present drive is encrypted simultaneously, in the order described above.To give you an idea: My 3TB holds my porn &amp; my software installs, and my 8TB holds my backups &amp; general media (videos, pictures, projects, and torrent seeds).On my 3TB, my porn folder (named ""Downloads"") was encrypted first, then the sequential files within folder ""UE4"", wherein it was stopped halfway.On my 8TB drive, which holds significantly larger files, only the files within folder **A** \- **B** were encrypted. Thankfully, these were mostly **B**ackups from an old installation that I'd conveniently forgot to delete.For the C drive, encryption started in the AppData/Local/Temp folder, which held the folder containing the Ransomware EXE file.
* The software used was Phobos Ransomware, or perhaps a variation. As of August 2019, there is no way to decrypt the encrypted files without the decryption key.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also worth noting that the activator worked, and that the bug isn't directly linked with the Vegas Pro 17 EXE file. Something I discovered after copying the installation folder to an external, and migrating it to a freshly re-formatted Win7 installation.

That said, the EXE does continue to linger in the background after exiting VP 17, which suggests that while it isn't the cause directly, it may be working alongside the virus installation app that was installed by the Activator.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully, nothing of value was lost. Of course, that was only by a streak of luck, as I was able to catch it in time.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were hit by this, I'm sorry. The best I can tell you is to hold on to the encrypted files until the necessary decryption software is created, format your C drive, and perform a fresh installation of Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

cvpsf4,"Netflix came along to reduce piracy, and now has caused more piracy","I know a more accurate title would say about ""other services causing more piracy"" or ""licence holders causing more piracy"" but that wouldn't have felt so good in my opinion.

For a start what do I mean when i say ""Netflix came along to reduce piracy""? Around the point netflix became a thing people would download movies left and right just because they were too lazy (or poor) to buy the films/tv shows that they wanted to watch, thus a service was born to make it a lot easier to binge watch a program (and also removing the getting up changing disk/tape at the end of a section of episodes, finding the next disk/tape and putting it back in (then for tape realising you didnt rewind it last time you watched it and thus have to rewind it anyway) netflix removed about 90% of the problems, theres still the cost involved and what not but thats a different thing.

So in that regard they tried to reduce piracy by making things a lot more convieniant (i have a gaming related side point that made me want to pirate more due to how things were when I started gaming on steam) but now with rights holders being stupid for whatever reasons i feel that it is encouraging more piracy.

For this I will look at originals made just because we now have a streaming service (disney +) (as disney owns marvel and you can still watch marvel films on netflix and i think amazon prime too, havent checked) and also content like supernatural, death note (anima not live action) and other such third party properties (i have a foot note on death note too)

so lets start off talking about pricing, in 2019 the american price of Disney plus is $7 the price of Netflix is $12.99 and amazon prime is $12.99, those three services coming to $32.98 (£26.96 converted not calculated) thats just the cost of the streaming services alone, not covering the monthly cost of internet and electricity and obviously I dont know situations in the USA (but if your wanting the three services then you prob have nothing to do during the day) and remember thats just 3 services there are many more (some only avalible in the us and some world wide) just looking [here](https://www.justwatch.com/uk) without scrolling there are 20 services that you can choose from (some free and some paid with bbc iplayer being a strange one which I may mention if someone posts about it in the comments) as such there are bound to be exculisive to one area or one service, for example I know that on netflix I can watch supernatural in the USA but not the UK, in the UK I can stream on amazon prime (note SPN is made by the CW which I belive also has its own streaming service, and as a side you can only view the CW website if you live in the USA or the site thinks you do at least) 

now thats just one example there are other examples and my personal favourite one that is really stupid, in the UK on netflix I can watch death note, but i can only watch it with japanese audio ""due to licencing"" 

So what would I do in that situation, torrent it, get the english dubed files and download them, same with SPN if I didnt have prime, so while netflix early days were there to prevent piracy due to how distributers are being with the licences its causing more piracy",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cvpsf4/netflix_came_along_to_reduce_piracy_and_now_has/,1566834329.0,74,0.89,47,Piracy,quickhakker

### I. PRIVACY/SECURITY

##### VPNs

If it has not become apparent yet, popular VPN services aggressively market their products not just in this subreddit but in Reddit as a whole. Do not subscribe to a service just because Reddit deems it popular, cheap, or because it hits the frontpage. Do your own research. You're entrusting an entity with your personal data. Not to mention VPN experiences are completely anecdotal. Someone's great experience with a particular VPN may vary from yours if you're connected to different servers, physically in different locations, different operating systems, downloads speeds, etc. There are far too many variables to successfully vague a VPN.

With that said, ThatOnePrivacySite is a great resource to start with but it shouldn't be your final destination. Most if not all popular VPNs offer trials or immediate refunds. Use them to your advantage. Read VPNs' terms of service. Below are some resources in which you can start your research with:

&amp;nbsp;

* [ThatOnePrivacySite VPN Chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-section/)

* [Choosing the best VPN for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/4iho8e/that_one_privacy_guys_guide_to_choosing_the_best/?st=iu9u47u7&amp;sh=459a76f2)

* [TorrentFreak 2017 VPN interview](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-anonymous-review-2017-170304/)

* [TorrentFreak 2016 VPN interview](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-anonymous-review-160220/)

* [EEF Overview on what a VPN is and how to choose one](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you)

* https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/wiki/index

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Privacy/wiki/index

&amp;nbsp;

Beware of free VPNs if you plan on using one for online purchases or to login websites with sensitive data (banking for example). Many free VPNs are able to provide their free services because they datamine, interposing ads in your 
searches, etc... Beware of pirating VPNs. You wouldn't pirate a condom?

[An alternative to purchasing your VPN is hosting your own](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/search?q=vps&amp;restrict_sr=on). You will have much more flexibility and you can have your VPS hoster outside your country's copyright law jurisdiction.



##### Adblockers &amp; useful extensions

* [uBlock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) for blocking most ads and pop-ups.
* [uBlock-safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari) port for Safari or MacOS users.
* [uBlock origin extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco) - companion extension for websites that block ad-block extensions (even with Anti-Adblock Killer enabled in uBlock origin).

---
---

### II. TORRENT CLIENTS
 
 * [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/) - similar to qbittorrent with a different UI some may find clunky.
 
 * [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) - free open-sourced client. No ads and has a built-in search feature that searches popular public trackers. Consistently updated.
 
 * Tixati - extremely customizable. All menus can be rearranged and color scheme can be changed completely. Many private trackers however may not permit this client to be used.
 
 * [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) - popular macOS and unix torrent client.

5dbfm3,Windows Guide: Enabling your vPN for a single program while letting everything else use your normal connection.,"This guide was originally written by myself in a thread here on /r/piracy, however i think many people would like a setup like this, hence this post.

Essentially this setup will let you run your VPN at all times without worrying about high ping in online games and the like, as only one (or more if you want) program will be using your VPN while the rest will be using your normal connection.

I learned how to set this up by experimenting as there was no guide for doing this on Windows on the internet last time i checked. Please send a link to such a guide if you find one, it might be better than mine :)


This guide is written for use with qBittorrent and privateinternetaccess(PIA) VPN, but the VPN provider doesn't matter alot as long as your VPN has config files that you can download for use with OpenVPN. I strongly recommend using qBittorrent as it can bind to a network interface which will become very useful later in the guide.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Part 1, Setting up OpenVPN:**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Step 1 you need to use [Openvpn](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html) instead of the PIA app. This gives us much more customizabilty and as far as i know the PIA app is built on openvpn anyways. So have Openvpn installed.

* Step 2 you need to get the openvpn config files for PIA from [PIA's website](https://privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn-ip.zip)

* Step 3 place the "".pem"", "".ca"" and **one** (Choose best location for you) of the "".ovpn"" files in ""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"" like so: http://i.imgur.com/1xZZAb5.png

* Step 4  create a file called pass.txt in the same folder and insert your PIA username and password on two lines like so: http://i.imgur.com/Wpef5bP.png

* Step 5  insert into the "".ovpn"" file you placed in the ""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"" folder: 
**auth-user-pass pass.txt**

Now you should be able to start Openvpn GUI, right click the icon in the taskbar and press connect and this will connect you to PIA servers with the Openvpn client instead of the PIA client.

Check if your IP has changed with https://ipleak.net or https://www.doileak.com/


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Part 2, Setting network routes:**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Step 1 Add these lines to the "".ovpn"" file:

**script-security 2**

**route-noexec**

**up up.bat**

**down down.bat**


* Step 2 create an ""up.bat"" and a ""down.bat"" in the config folder like so: http://i.imgur.com/k9mvC9g.png


* Step 3 insert into the ""up.bat"":

**ROUTE ADD 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 %ifconfig_remote%**


* Step 4 insert into the ""down.bat"":

**ROUTE DELETE 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 %ifconfig_remote%**


* Step 5 This part is why using qBittorrent is a very good idea for this sort of setup but if you **really** don't want to switch you'll have to find a way to bind your torrent client to a network interface.

Open qBittorrent and go into settings, and then ""advanced"". Then you want to set the network interface to your VPN interface like so: http://i.imgur.com/T6y4B1P.png

This will make qBittorrent communcate via the VPN and **ONLY** the VPN, in my experience. This means that if the VPN tunnel goes down, qBittorrent will lose connection instead of connecting with your real IP. You will have to restart qBittorrent every time the VPN is restarted to connect to the new VPN ip though. (Make sure you have exited qBittorrent in the taskbar when restarting it).


* Step 6 Try going to https://doileak.com and activate the torrent test. Add the magnet links to qBittorrent and start the test. If it worked the ""Request IP"" should be different from the ""Torrent HTTP Request IP"" and the ""Torrent UDP Request IP""

Maybe you have noticed that qBittorrent is still using some of your non-VPN DNS servers though.


* Step 7 My best solution to the DNS server problem is making everything on your PC use [OpenDNS](https://use.opendns.com/) DNS servers instead of your ISP's or your VPN's. To do this add these lines to the "".ovpn"" file:

**dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222**

**dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220**

**block-outside-dns**


Check with https://doileak.com again, all your dns requests from qBittorrent and from your browser should now come from OpenDNS making it harder (to the best of my knowledge) to correlate your normal IP with your VPN IP.

If you experience any issues with your DNS servers cutting out, remove these 3 lines again. I have only had these issues on one of the 2 PC's i use with this setup.


* Step 8 Start OpenVPN as a service. 

Go into Services in Windows.

Find OpenVPN Service and go into it's properties.

Set Startup type to automatic, press apply and press start. OpenVPN should now run in the background at all times.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**PART 3, Making qBittorrent start and stop automatically with the VPN:**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A command to start and stop qBittorrent can be added to the up.bat and down.bat files. This is neat because qBittorrent has to be restarted every time the VPN restarts and by adding it to the bat files you don't have to do it manually. However, when using openvpn as a service it doesn't start qBittorrent the same way as if you had started it yourself (because of the way services are handled in Windows). 

Therefore it will not appear as ""desktop program"" but will still be running in the background. 

This means that the only way to access qBittorrent is through the WebUI.


The command to add to ""up.bat"" is:

**start /d ""C:\Program Files (x86)\qBittorrent\"" qbittorrent.exe**

http://i.imgur.com/IJCiGr3.png

The command to add to ""down.bat"" is:

**taskkill /F /IM ""qbittorrent.exe""**

http://i.imgur.com/zDeb43M.png


Then there is a couple a steps you need to take to make sure the OpenVPN Service is logged in as your user:


* Step 1 Go to services, right click OpenVPN Service and go to properties. 


* Step 2 In the ""Log On"" tab press ""this account"" and click browse. 


* Step 3 Press advanced and a large window will popup.


* Step 4 In the large windows press find now and a list of users will appear at the bottom of the window.

It should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/jxrH3i9.png


* Step 5 Double click your username(""Hundter"" in my case) in the list.


* Step 6 Press Ok to close the large window. Press Ok again to close the smaller window. Your username should now be in the box next to ""This account"".


* Step 7 Enter the password for the user in Password and Confirm Password and press Ok.


Assuming that you have enabled WebUI in qBittorrent you should be able to access the WebUI without starting qBittorrent yourself as long as the VPN is running.


Assuming you followed the guide you should now have an amazing VPN setup (in my opinion) that will let you use your PC for gaming, browsing and other activites where low latency or direct connection is preferred :)

4w0qix,"Now that KAT is gone, I wrote a small script that automatically hides fake torrents on Pirate Bay based on conditional logic.","One of the things I've noticed after having to use Pirate Bay for a while, is the significant amount of fake torrents. For example if you browse the HD Movies section and sort by seeds, (depending on when their bot ran) you'll see a [ton of untrusted torrents](http://puu.sh/qngwb.png) with an unrealistic amount of seeds.

The script has a couple options to get rid of these. The default behaviour is to hide untrusted torrents (torrents without the little pink or green skulls) if they have more than 1000 seeds.

&amp;nbsp;

The max number of seeds can be changed to whatever amount you want, but I've found 1000 works well:

**maxSeedsWithoutTrust = 1000** *(change number to whatever)*

&amp;nbsp;
   
You also have the option to hide untrusted torrents if they don't have comments:

**hideUntrustedTorrentsWithoutComments = true** *(true or false)*

&amp;nbsp;
   
You can also choose to *only* show trusted torrents, and hide everything else:

**trustedTorrentsOnly = true** *(true or false)*

&amp;nbsp;
   
Alternatively, instead of hiding the torrents, you can simply have them flagged (red background):

**dontHideJustWarn = true** *(true or false)*

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously there will be some false positives with this sort of setup, but in my opinion it's better to be safe than sorry. A lot of the fake torrents are created by copyright companies that log the IP addresses used to download the torrent and will report it to your ISP. This is called torrent poisoning. Rogers in Canada will send you a notice on behalf of these copyright trolls asking you to pay a fee in order to guarantee no legal action is taken (this happened to a family friend of mine).

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, with that said, here's the script:

&gt; // Change the values below if you want
&gt;  
&gt;maxSeedsWithoutTrust = 1000
&gt;  
&gt;trustedTorrentsOnly = false
&gt;  
&gt;hideUntrustedTorrentsWithoutComments = false
&gt;  
&gt;dontHideJustWarn = false
&gt;  
&gt;disableThisCompletely = false
&gt;  
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt;  
&gt;// Don't touch anything past this point
&gt;  
&gt;function hide(a){dontHideJustWarn?a.css(""background"",""#fbbdbd""):a.hide()}disableThisCompletely||(hidePorn&amp;&amp;$(""#searchResult tbody tr"").each(function(a){$(this).children(""td:nth-child(1)"").text().search(""Porn"")!=-1&amp;&amp;hide($(this))}),hideFrench&amp;&amp;$(""#searchResult tbody tr"").each(function(a){$(this).find(""td .detLink"").text().toLowerCase().search(""french"")!=-1&amp;&amp;hide($(this))}),hideTelesyncsAndCams&amp;&amp;$(""#searchResult tbody tr"").each(function(a){torrentTitle=$(this).find(""td .detLink"").text().toLowerCase(),torrentTitle.search(""hdcam"")==-1&amp;&amp;torrentTitle.search("" cam "")==-1&amp;&amp;torrentTitle.search(""hd-ts"")==-1&amp;&amp;torrentTitle.search(""hdts"")==-1&amp;&amp;torrentTitle.search(""camrip"")==-1&amp;&amp;torrentTitle.search(""camrip"")==-1||hide($(this))}),$('#searchResult tbody tr:not(:has(img[title=""VIP""],img[title=""Trusted""],img[title=""Moderator""],img[title=""Helper""],td[style=""text-align:center;""]))').each(function(a){trustedTorrentsOnly?hide($(this)):hideUntrustedTorrentsWithoutComments?(torrentSeeds=Number($(this).children(""td:nth-child(3)"").text()),(torrentSeeds&gt;=maxSeedsWithoutTrust||0===$(this).has(""img[src='//thepiratebay.org/static/img/icon_comment.gif']"").length)&amp;&amp;hide($(this))):(torrentSeeds=Number($(this).children(""td:nth-child(3)"").text()),torrentSeeds&gt;=maxSeedsWithoutTrust&amp;&amp;hide($(this)))}));

&amp;nbsp;

Installing it is super easy, if you're using Chrome, [install this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk), visit The Pirate Bay, click the *cjs* icon on the top right of your toolbar, click the *enable cjs for this host* checkbox, paste the script above and click *Save*.

If you're using Firefox, you can [install this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-style-script/). I haven't actually tried it, but the instructions should be similar to what's above.

Hopefully people will find this useful, if not, no big deal just thought I'd share it just in case :)

**Additional Step for Mac:** Close spotify, right click it, select 'Open Package Contents', then navigate to 'Contents/Resources/Apps' and delete 'ad.spa'

**Unbound DNS** If you are using unbound dns, u/BKPepe has converted the host file manually to unbound format: 

https://pastebin.com/C7LucEcy 

&amp;nbsp;

~~In another thread I saw just having pubads.g.doubleclick.net
and securepubads.g.doubleclick.net in the host file was sufficient to block all spotify ads. Play around and see if it works.~~

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Use this tool ~~https://spotifyadkiller.blogspot.com/~~  https://www.ericzhang.me/projects/spotify-ad-blocker-ezblocker/
(windows)** 

~~This tool basically rewrites the windows firewall rules to block certain ip addresses. Use this together with #1 for the best results. Or if you want to do it manually you can...~~ 

Use [Ezblocker](https://www.ericzhang.me/projects/spotify-ad-blocker-ezblocker/) instead 

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Add the following ip ranges to your router or firewall**

&gt; 31.13.76.102
&gt; 
&gt; 173.194.0.0-173.194.255.255
&gt; 
&gt; 216.58.192.0-216.58.223.255
&gt; 
&gt; 74.125.0.0-74.125.255.255
&gt; 
&gt; 2.16.4.0-2.16.4.255
&gt; 
&gt; 74.125.136.0-74.125.136.255
&gt; 
&gt; 173.194.65.0-173.194.65.255
&gt; 
&gt; 23.235.43.0-23.235.43.255
&gt;
&gt; 194.68.165.0-194.68.165.255

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Use the spotify web application with ublock origin**
Use the [spotify web application](https://play.spotify.com/?utm_source=web-player&amp;utm_campaign=bookmark) and install [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) on your browser.

[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) |  [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Use the modified spotify apk for android together with adaway.**

Download the modified version from Riu from alphagamers. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to warez here so you can go google for ""Spotify by riu alphagamers ver [*whatever the latest spotify version number is*]""

&amp;nbsp;

**6. Use the modified spotify apk for IOS (non-jailbreak)**

Google for ""Spotify++ ver [*whatever the latest spotify version number is*]"" or ""spotilife ver [*whatever the latest spotify version number is*]"" and use cydia impactor to sign it. Or get it from the paid signing services, r/sideloaded can point you in the right direction

&amp;nbsp;

**7. Buy premium subscription** 

Obviously the best choice if you are able to afford it :)

4bvsnz,"[Updated Tools] Easy to follow beginner's guide for DeDRMing amazon trial, rental, and purchased ebooks","Back at it again with another release! The tools I have included in this release should alleviate the problems that you have all been having with the updated kindle security. Enjoy the free books, remember to share them, and note that this is **not** a request thread and I **will not** do your work for you. 

Edit: No I will not do your work for you, nor will I buy a book and then do your work for you. Don't ask. 

Note: The update is for windows devices only. Sorry OSX, you're SOL at the moment. 

Easy-to-follow beginner's guide to DeDRMing Amazon trial and purchased ebooks self. 


First off, I would like to thank i&amp;lt;3cabbage and The Dark Reverser, because the standalone deDRM scripts are credited to them by the creator of the particular plugin I am using. Second, I would like to thank /u/amosqu. He has introduced us all to new tools and has done a great job of explaining how to use them, but I will take this a step farther - I will do a step-by-step installation and setup guide for you that includes links to all the relevant tools(the tools, not illegal content itself) in a way that you should be able to understand even if you are a beginner.

For starters, I will describe to you the type of books you can deDRM. The categories include purchased and trial versions of amazon books, and in most cases rental books. 

The required tools:

Calibre

Calibre is an ebook management tool that is used form conversion of ebooks in various formats to other formats. It can open most files, but is slow when compared to programs such as Adobe Digital Editions when trying to open .epub books to read.
http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows
The current version should work, however, I am using the old version of Calibre 2.21. If You follow these steps to the point and it does not work for you, consider uninstalling calibre and installing an older version.

Kindle for PC

Kindle for PC is Amazon's official kindle book reader for PC. It allows you to read books downloaded from Amazon's store that are in the .azw4 format. You will need it to download the books that you wish to deDRM.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download

DeDRM plugin[NEW]

This plugin allows your version of calibre to deDRM amazon's .azw4 files. For that reason, it is not allowed in calibre's official plugin download tool. You must download this .zip file and use calibre to load the plugin from it. This particular download is pre-modified, meaning that you do not have to edit any code for this plugin to function. Note: unzipping the tool does nothing for you. It is my suggestion that you leave it as is.

http://www.mediafire.com/download/3y3r9z2bk8c71t1/DeDRM_plugin.zip

Steps
Download and install calibre and Kindle for PC on your device.
Login or create an account on Amazon.com. I would suggest that this not be your personal account that you use to buy things with normally.

Log in to the same account on your Kindle for PC app.

Pick the book that you want to strip the DRM from. Select the ""try free"" or ""7-Day Trial"" button, whichever you see. Click the pulldown menu, and select ""Yourname's Kindle For PC"" as the device. If your device does not appear, I would suggest reviewing this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201216000. I often find that I am not logged in the same account on both the web browser and the PC, and this results in the issue.

Allow the amazon application to be launched. On my chrome browser, I am given a prompt in which I click ""Launch application.""

Make sure your book is downloaded. This can be found by opening the Kindle app and clicking the ""downloaded"" section. If your book is in this section, and displays a red bar with white text saying ""x days left of trial,"" then the book is downloaded. If it does not appear, it may be likely that you sent it to the wrong device. In this situation, you would have to make a new account entirely to access the trial again, as Amazon only seems to like allowing one device to have the trial.

Open calibre. Ignore any welcoming stuff it may have for you, as it's unnecessary to learn about the program at this point.
Click on the double arrows that appear next to ""Remove books."" Depending on your screen size, they may be placed differently or may not exist at all.

Click the preferences icon that has 3 gears.
Scroll down and click the green puzzle piece icon labelled ""plugins.""
Click the yellow puzzle piece icon that says ""get new plugins.""
Click on the kindleunpack plugin, and click install. Give it confirmation on anything it prompts you with. Also, if it asks you, have it loaded onto the navigation/favorites/plugin bar.

Download the DeDRM plugin I linked you to if you haven't already.
Click the bottom right option on the plugins screen in calibre that you should still be on that is labelled ""Load Plugin from file."" 

Confirm and accept any warnings it gives, and point it to the .zip file I had you download.

Once it is installed, close calibre, and then open it again.

Open your windows explorer, and go to /documents/mykindlecontent
If you correctly downloaded the book, the .azw4 file should be here. The name will be random and alphanumeric, and as far as I know, starting with the letter B.

Go to calibre. Copy the .azw4 from the folder to calibre.

Congratulations! You've deDRM'd an Amazon trial book.
But you're not done yet.

Click the book you just imported so it is highlighted in blue.
Click the arrows in the top right corner(as you did previously) and there should be a new icon, shaped like a triangle with rounded edges, and labelled ""Kindle Unpack.""

Click the icon. If your book was successfully deDRM'd, there will be a green unlocked selection. If the deDRM was unsuccessful, it will be red. If it is red, figure out what you did wrong or repeat the above steps for success.

Click the green unlocked icon and click ""extract pdf."" The .azw4 will then be converted to .PDF.

Right click the book you just converted in calibre, and click ""open containing folder"". This is the location of your PDF.

Final words:

Please do your best to share the file you make. If you remember how hard it was to find the book on torrent sites, and how people helped you out, consider making a torrent of the book.
This is not a request thread. Do not post ""can you please help me find --------- by --------?""

The old thread by /u/ManWithoutModem contains many sites that are no longer functional, so this is the best option.

I am not an expert. I have perfected a process for myselef that has worked on multiple machines, and have shared that with you so that it may help. Everyone's circumstances are different. If you can't get this program to work, feel free to comment here and I will try to help you as best I can, but I make no promises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/4bvsnz/updated_tools_easy_to_follow_beginners_guide_for/,1458896234.0,152,0.94,9,Piracy,[deleted]

crcvj0,Parents found out I have been torrenting and my mum won't stop crying..,"She's so disappointed in me and keeps going on how she's raised a thug and asking where did she go wrong with me.. My dad is also disappointed and wants me to turn myself into the cops as he is convinced they're already onto me as he says for the past few nights he has seen the same white van parked outside the house. It's only a few movies but they are saying I could get 5 years a piece but think if I come clean now, I may get my sentence cut to half. My dad says once I'm out I can come and work for him as no one will employ me with a record of theft.

What do you suggest I do in this situation? It's unlikely that if I go to jail that I won't be taken advantage on within the first 5 minutes as I have very nice skin and hair.


--
UPDATE: Many have asked for an update. Firstly I'm abit disappointed that my situation has been made out to be a joke, the mods tagged a serious matter as humour and that is upsetting. Its not funny to my parents, my mum even started smoking again and she gave up almost 7 years ago. Moving onto what happend:

So I turned myself in, they bought me into a room and I started crying hysterically as I felt like this was it for me and I wouldn't return home for 15 years. I ended up telling them about 2 drug dealers in the area..one being my friends brother, it was pretty much the first thing that I blurted out, my main goal was to strike a deal as someone in this thread said I should try this and it seemed like a good idea.. But the thing is I said all this in panic, the cops only brought me in to explain why what I did was wrong and let me go.. But they were then interested in these drug dealers I spoke about so I told them everything, not sure what they will do with this information, I know my friends brother did time in Juvey a few years back so they probably know his background.

My parents have pretty much incarcerated me, I no longer have access to my computer and I'm grounded for 2 months which involves helping my dad with the family business, today I was up at 5am milking the cows, and later I need to go to confession with the family priest and ask for forgiveness. I am lucky they didnt take my phone I'm not even sure they remembered I have one so I'm not using it when they are around.

And worst thing about all this is..

cojep7,How to boost the volume of video files with low audio.,"This is a quick and easy method for boosting the volume of .MP4 video files which contain AAC audio.

It's the best way I've found to boost the audio level of video files with low volume AAC audio.

It will not improve the quality of the audio. 

It will not magically transform 2 channel audio to 5.1 surround sound.

It will boost the very low audio to a higher volume and reduce the volume of the loudest parts. This is a compromise which, for me, makes the viewing experience better if you are simply plugging a usb drive into a cheap tv and playing the file.

**Note - You will end up with an .mkv file if you use this method.**

What you'll need:

\- A video file with low/quiet audio

\- Audacity ([https://www.audacityteam.org/download/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/))

\- FFmpeg for Audacity ([https://lame.buanzo.org/](https://lame.buanzo.org/))

\- MKVToolNix ([https://mkvtoolnix.download/](https://mkvtoolnix.download/))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

1. Open the video file with audacity. Only the audio should open.

2. Select the entire audio track (Ctrl+A) 

3. Go to Effect-&gt;Compresser

4. Turn on the ""Make up gain for 0 db.."" and ""Compress based on Peaks"" options

5. Leaving the other controls as default works for me, but feel free to experiment.

6. Click OK to apply compression

7. Export the modified audio file as AAC

8. Open the original video file with MKVToolNix 

9. De-select the audio track (AAC)

10. Drag the new audio file created with Audacity into MKVToolNix 

11. In the dialog window, select the first option ""Add as new source files ..."" 

12. Make sure that the tracks dialog now shows one video and (at least) two audio tracks

13. Disable all audio tracks except the new one you just added

14. Click ""Start multiplexing""

15. The mkv file that is generated should have the original video and new compressed audio.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cojep7/how_to_boost_the_volume_of_video_files_with_low/,1565450843.0,492,0.96,73,Piracy,ChilliNLime

ceuzki,"By request, How to Setup a Raspberry Pi-racy Box","I got a few requests for a guide on how I setup my Raspberry Pi-racy box that I posted about [here](https://redd.it/ceeg11), so here it is. I will assume some basic familiarity with the systems involved. I run mine on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ although the guide should work for most Pis.

**Step 0:** Sign up for a good VPN provider. Don't use free ones, they're supported by selling your data. I use IVPN, but please do your own research (a good starting point is https://thatoneprivacysite.net). For our purposes, make sure they support openvpn and will give you .ovpn configuration files. You'll probably also want an external hard drive of some sort due to the limits of the microSD. I use a 2 TB Western Digital.

**Step 1:** Install Raspbian Buster, with desktop.

**Step 2:** Install necessary software. Transmission being the basic torrent client and openvpn for security.
    
    apt install transmission openvpn

**Step 3:** Connect to the VPN provider. Open terminal and navigate to wherever you stored your VPN provider's openvpn config files. Then
    
    sudo openvpn --config your-config-file.ovpn

**Step 4:** Verify via ipleak.net and/or similar sites that your IP address is showing your VPN provider. To be extra safe, ipleak.net allows you to activate torrent address detection and add the magnet link provided to Transmission. It will then show which IP torrent trackers will pick up.

**Step 5:** Find stuff to download and seed. I use a couple of popular torrent sites (though I believe it's not permitted to link to them, correct me if I'm wrong) and simply look for trending torrents. If the site allows, I sort by leechers to more easily see which files need more bandwidth. I've also grabbed niche files like audiobooks and less popular video games but they don't contribute too much to my upload as there aren't a lot of leechers. ~~Then I just grab the magnet link, go to Transmission and hit File -&gt; Open URL, and start the download.~~ (see edit below)

**Step 6:** Monitor your files. If a torrent is stalled for a long period of time (you determine what's long enough), delete it and find new ones.

That's really all there is to it. If you want me to go more in depth or need more help, let me know. I'll try my best to respond. Also, comments work better than PMs because then others can help, too. Thanks for the appreciation shown when I posted my stats! Enjoy!

**Edit:** I ran into some weird network connectivity issues and then for some reason Transmission stopped recognizing my local data no matter what I did, so I had to clear my hard drive and start over again. **To prevent some of this trouble in the future,** I will stop using magnet links and instead download .torrent files whenever possible. This way if I have trouble with the local data, all I have to do is reopen the .torrent file.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/ceuzki/by_request_how_to_setup_a_raspberry_piracy_box/,1563468542.0,1363,0.97,134,Piracy,NotTRYINGtobeLame

ce642n,Netflix and 13 Reasons Why,"I have just learned of the fact that Netflix has removed a scene from the first season of the show 13 Reasons Why because of its graphic depiction of suicide and self-harm. While I do agree that there can be a debate about whether the scene is problematic or not, this is not what I wish to argue here.

Just about all coverage of this issue is focused around the topic of suicide, but unfortunately I have seen little to no discussion of what this means for media preservation. Especially considering that Netflix has stated it will go after pirated clips uploaded to the internet that depict the original, un-altered scene.

It's no secret that many people resort to some form of piracy as a means of media preservation when legal and official methods have failed them, and this is a perfect example. Despite your personal feelings of the show's quality, the simple fact is that Netflix edited out an impactful scene from a work. They are not offering you an option to view the original content. They will try as hard as they can to take down the original content. The worst part...Netflix itself has the rights to both the show itself and it's only legal means of distribution.

Just wanted to start a conversation about this, because I have not seen many other places bring this issue up.

EDIT: First, I wanted to sincerely thank everyone for a lively conversation, even if we don't all see eye to eye. I wanted to clarify my point a bit further: In no way am I trying to force Netflix to recant and restore the original version, nor am I advocating for Netflix or any creator to be forced to make previous versions of their work available. I simply  wanted to get a variety of opinions on what your personal stance is regarding a work being **retroactively** changed with no option or recourse whatsoever to allow for the consumption of the original media. In the days of physical media, this was a much simpler affair, because the physical media would still likely circulate and be easy to obtain. In the days of digital distribution, DRM, and exclusivity, this becomes a very complex issue to tackle. Thanks in advance for any comments or further discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/ce642n/netflix_and_13_reasons_why/,1563326628.0,895,0.94,306,Piracy,mauro_rmp

3ma9qe,"[GUIDE] How to ""rent"" your textbooks for free from Amazon using DeDRM Tools &amp; Kindle Unpack","Going to college? Living off top ramen for dinner? Let me show you have to ""rent"" your textbooks for free &amp; for life!

For this example, we will use this book. If you have found another book that is eligible to rent for free, feel free to try it with that one.
http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00HQO05X0/ref=mt_kindle

Download the Kindle for PC application, and send your book there.
http://smile.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download

**Prerequisites:**

1. Download Python 2.7 (ActivePython is the best version)
https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads

2. Download Notepad++ (possibly the best text editor out there, however you're free to use whatever you have on your computer)
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/

3. Download &amp; Extract the latest DeDRM package (6.3.4 at time of writing)
https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases/tag/v6.3.4

You have a few options at this point. You can use the standalone Windows application or use the Calibre Plugin. Your choice.

**Standalone:**

1. Navigate to DeDRM_App\DeDRM_lib\lib\ then find and edit the mobidedrm.py file
2. At time of writing, somewhere around the line 440 is where you will need to comment out (using # at beginning of the line) or delete the following code:


        if val406 != 0:
        raise DrmException(u""Cannot decode library or rented ebooks."")
3. Save the file, and find eDRM_Drop_Target.bat within the DeDRM_App folder
4. Now find your Kindle eBook within the My Kindle Content folder with your Documents folder. Drag and drop your .azw4 file on the batch script. It will begin to process.
5. Congrats! You're now DRM free! Look in the folder where your .azw4 is (in this example, within My Kindle Content) to find a companion file with ""_nodrm"" at the end of the file name

https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/3kv9k6/easytofollow_beginners_guide_to_dedrming_amazon/

Now that you have a deDRM Kindle ebook, you're thinking of converting it with Calibre to PDF right?

**STOP! DON'T RUIN YOUR NEW EBOOK!!**

Download Kindle Unpack, this will preserve ALL formatting and graphics within the ebook. 
AZW4 files are simply PDFs with DRM after-all, so there's no reason to convert!

https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack/archive/master.zip

1. Unzip the KindleUnpack-master.zip file
2. Run KindleUnpack.pyc from the KindleUnpack folder
3. Browse for your nodrm version of the Kindle eBook, then create a new output directory (trust me, this will unpack a lot of useless files you will soon delete
4. Start the unpacking process. You will then have a folder full of tons of files. Within that folder is a .PDF

**Congrats! You now have within your possession a high quality PDF you can take anywhere, anytime, forever!**

If instead standalone apps aren't your thing, or you already use Calibre, here's a guide to get started with the help of [molotoviphone](https://www.reddit.com/user/molotoviphone) from his guide:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/3kv9k6/easytofollow_beginners_guide_to_dedrming_amazon/

**Calibre:**

1. Navigate to DeDRM_calibre_plugin and extract DeDRM_plugin.zip
2. Inside the directory with the extracted files, find and edit the mobidedrm.py file
3. At time of writing, somewhere around the line 440 is where you will need to comment out (using # at beginning of the line) or delete the following code:


        if val406 != 0:
        raise DrmException(u""Cannot decode library or rented ebooks."")
4. Save the file, and create a new zip archive of the entire contents of this folder
5. In Calibre, go to Preferences (by clicking the arrow on the right), Plugins, and Load Plugin from File. Find the new zip you made and select Open. Then select Yes. While you're there, install the latest KindleUnpack plugin (0.81.2 at time of writing)
https://github.com/dougmassay/kindleunpack-calibre-plugin/releases/download/v0.81.2/kindle_unpack_v0812_plugin.zip
5. Now find your Kindle eBook within the My Kindle Content folder with your Documents folder. Drag and drop your .azw4 file into Calibre. It will begin to process.
6. Congrats! You're now DRM free! Look in the folder where your Calibre Library is (in this example, within my Documents folder). Drill down the folder paths till you find the Kindle Book.
7. Now find KindleUnpack within Calibre, located in the toolbar menu by clicking the same small arrow on the right where you found Preferences.
8. Select the Extract PDF option. Then right click the ebook in Calibre and click ""open containing folder"".

3kv9k6,Easy-to-follow beginner's guide to DeDRMing Amazon trial and purchased ebooks,"First off, I would like to thank i&lt;3cabbage and The Dark Reverser, because the standalone deDRM scripts are credited to them by the creator of the particular plugin I am using. Second, I would like to thank /u/amosqu. He has introduced us all to new tools and has done a great job of explaining how to use them, but I will take this a step farther - I will do a step-by-step installation and setup guide for you that includes links to all the relevant tools(the tools, not illegal content itself) in a way that you should be able to understand even if you are a beginner. 

For starters, I will describe to you the type of books you can deDRM. The categories include purchased and trial versions of amazon books. This does *not* include rentals. 

**The required tools:**

*Calibre*

Calibre is an ebook management tool that is used form conversion of ebooks in various formats to other formats. It can open most files, but is slow when compared to programs such as Adobe Digital Editions when trying to open .epub books to read. 

http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows

The current version should work, however, I am using the old version of Calibre 2.21. If You follow these steps to the point and it does not work for you, consider uninstalling calibre and installing an older version. 

*Kindle for PC*

Kindle for PC is Amazon's official kindle book reader for PC. It allows you to read books downloaded from Amazon's store that are in the .azw4 format. You will need it to download the books that you wish to deDRM. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download

*DeDRM plugin*

This plugin allows your version of calibre to deDRM amazon's .azw4 files. For that reason, it is not allowed in calibre's official plugin download tool. You must download this .zip file and use calibre to load the plugin from it. This particular download is **pre-modified**, meaning that you do not have to edit any code for this plugin to function. Note: unzipping the tool does nothing for you. It is my suggestion that you leave it as is. 

http://www.mediafire.com/download/eepjc4w8h9a8kyx/DeDRM_plugin.zip 

**Steps**

1. Download and install calibre and Kindle for PC on your device. 

2. Login or create an account on Amazon.com. I would suggest that this not be your personal account that you use to buy things with normally. 

3. Log in to the same account on your Kindle for PC app. 

4. Pick the book that you want to strip the DRM from. Select the ""try free"" or ""7-Day Trial"" button, whichever you see. Click the pulldown menu, and select ""Yourname's Kindle For PC"" as the device. If your device does not appear, I would suggest reviewing this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201216000. I often find that I am not logged in the same account on both the web browser and the PC, and this results in the issue. 

5. Allow the amazon application to be launched. On my chrome browser, I am given a prompt in which I click ""Launch application.""

6. Make sure your book is downloaded. This can be found by opening the Kindle app and clicking the ""downloaded"" section. If your book is in this section, and displays a red bar with white text saying ""x days left of trial,"" then the book is downloaded. If it does not appear, it may be likely that you sent it to the wrong device. In this situation, you would have to make a new account entirely to access the trial again, as Amazon only seems to like allowing one device to have the trial. 

7. Open calibre. Ignore any welcoming stuff it may have for you, as it's unnecessary to learn about the program at this point. 

8. Click on the double arrows that appear next to ""Remove books."" Depending on your screen size, they may be placed differently or may not exist at all. 

9. Click the preferences icon that has 3 gears.

10. Scroll down and click the green puzzle piece icon labelled ""plugins.""

11. Click the yellow puzzle piece icon that says ""get new plugins.""

12. Click on the kindleunpack plugin, and click install. Give it confirmation on anything it prompts you with. Also, if it asks you, have it loaded onto the navigation/favorites/plugin bar. 

13. Download the DeDRM plugin I linked you to if you haven't already. 

14. Click the bottom right option on the plugins screen in calibre that you should still be on that is labelled ""Load Plugin from file."" Confirm and accept any warnings it gives, and point it to the .zip file I had you download. 

15. Once it is installed, close calibre, and then open it again. 

16. Open your windows explorer, and go to /documents/mykindlecontent

17. If you correctly downloaded the book, the .azw4 file should be here. The name will be random and alphanumeric, and as far as I know, starting with the letter B. 

18. Go to calibre. Copy the .azw4 from the folder to calibre. 

**Congratulations! You've deDRM'd an Amazon trial book.**

 But you're not done yet. 

19. Click the book you just imported so it is highlighted in blue. 

20. Click the arrows in the top right corner(as you did previously) and there should be a new icon, shaped like a triangle with rounded edges, and labelled ""Kindle Unpack."" 

21. Click the icon. If your book was successfully deDRM'd, there will be a green unlocked selection. If the deDRM was unsuccessful, it will be red. If it is red, figure out what you did wrong or repeat the above steps for success.

21. Click the green unlocked icon and click ""extract pdf."" The .azw4 will then be converted to .PDF. 

22. Right click the book you just converted in calibre, and click ""open containing folder"". This is the location of your PDF. 

**Final words:**

Please do your best to share the file you make. If you remember how hard it was to find the book on torrent sites, and how people helped you out, consider making a torrent of the book. 

This is not a request thread. I am deDRMing trial books from amazon up until 9/19/2015, and you may message me with the amazon link up until the 19th and I will send you a link with a PDF by the 19th of September. Do not post ""can you please help me find --------- by --------?""

3i9y7n,Guide for Finding Textbooks,"I'm going to thank [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44) and [this](https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-list-of-free-ebook-dwnld-sites) for most of the methods that I'm going to explain in this thread.

So you have a list of books you need to buy for college. There are some really great resources for finding them online, but I'm going to run through the easiest methods for searching all of them here.

First, let's start off by using the method that will allow you to find the vast majority of books. Google. It tends to be easier if you can search multiple sites at once, and this is the easiest way to do it.

There was a search engine that /u/ratokursi made 3 years ago, but by now most of the sites are either dead or have changed the url. I decided to make a new one, this time after reviewing 100+ sites and adding to working ones to the custom search engine.

https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers

Sites it indexes: http://pastebin.com/62tKNmm1.

Also search on [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) since it's not showing up in the search results for some odd reason.

This should be able to find most of your books. Unfortunately, not every book ever published is going to be on the internet.

Trying ""ext:pdf (title of book)"" into Google might also yield some results, just be careful what you click on.

So, in order to find the ones you can't find, there a few other ways to find them.

You can download ebooks via irc. The easiest way to search is on a search engine, like this one: https://ixirc.com/. Then follow the last part of /u/ManWithoutModem's post:

&gt; IRC

&gt; irc://irc.undernet.org/bookz

&gt; If you don't know how to use IRC to download books, check out this link or read this:

&gt; IRC

&gt; You obviously need an IRC client installed, a quick google search should find you a bunch of decent free ones.

&gt; Load the client and then type:

&gt; /server irc.irchighway.net

&gt; This will connect you to the irchighway server. Once you're on there, type:

&gt; /join #ebooks

&gt; This will take you into the ebooks channel, which has more than 2.2Terabytes of ebooks for free download. Once you're in, all you have to do to find what you want is to simply type:

&gt; @search ""Author or book title""



&gt; ... removing the inverted commas.

&gt; You'll get a message saying that your search has been accepted. A few seconds later a searchbot will offer you a file, so accept the download. That will send you a .txt file that's zipped. Extract that and you'll get a list of files. I searched for Lian Hearn and got a list of 147 files. Here's an extract from it:

&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar - 142.1 KB
&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori 2 - Grass for His Pillow (CO.rar - 355.3 KB
&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori 2 - Grass for His Pillow (ht.rar - 140.54 KB
&gt; !bald Lian_Hearn_-_[Otori_01]_-_Across_The_Nightingale_Floor_(v3)_.rar - 111.62 KB
&gt; !bald Lian_Hearn_-_[Otori_01]_-_Across_the_Nightingale_Floor_(v4.0.rar - 115.45 KB
&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 03] - Brilliance Of The Moo.rar - 175.53 KB
&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 04] - The Harsh Cry of the Heron (v1.0) (html).rar - 351.80 KB
&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of the Otori 05] - Heaven's Net Is Wide (v5.0) (epub).rar - 588.40 KB

&gt; Say I wanted to download the first book. I'd copy the text shown below, deliberately removing the file size information (I've been booted for that before ):

&gt; !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar

&gt; Then just paste that into the IRC window then press enter. After 2-3 seconds you get a prompt asking you to accept or decline the file.You know how to do the rest.

There are private torrent trackers that require either registration or an invite from someone else already on the site in order to join. Some examples include FreeTheTextbooks (Open Signup), My Anonamouse, BitSpyder, BitMe, and Bibliotik.

It's not advisable to try to gain access to one for just a few textbooks seeing as most require some sort of effort to look for something that may or may not be there. (FreeTheTextbooks might be worth it as it's open signup).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By now you're probably not going to find the book online. However, you still have many options. You can rent it from Chegg, get it used from Biblio.com, or DeDRM it after getting it on Amazon.

Chegg is a site where you can rent or buy used textbooks and also read some of the online. There should be a way to extract the text from the page content, hopefully /u/molotoviphone can elaborate on this. It's really good way to get the book saved outside of the rental period.

Biblio.com is a service similar to Chegg, except without the online feature.

Amazon is (as you probably already know) a site where you can buy new and used textbooks and also rent or buy digital kindle versions but they're encumbered with DRM. The rented version normally comes in a .azw4 file format, and the purchased version usually comes in a .mobi file format. These are probably both DRM-Protected.

In order to remove the DRM, you will need [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), some modified [DeDRM Tools](https://mega.nz/#!4J9nwAja!ExY_da0hmtp_0GDwLeTwBni5vURuBw0LCPersNaO8FU), and [KindleUnpack](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=138385&amp;d=1431870641).

This will allow you to remove the DRM on all azw4 and mobi files while removing your account name from the metadata.

Install calibre and install the DeDRM Plugin and KindleUnpack along with it. Then you can drag the .azw4 or .mobi files into Calibre and it will DeDRM it. Select the book, click the KindleUnpack icon, and select ""Extract PDF"".

At this point, you have no use for the DRMed copy of the book, so you can return it if you wish, and essentially get the book for free, or you can do whatever else you want with the book.

If all else fails, or you need some kind of online access code, your only choice is to buy the physical copy of the book or the online key.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since sharing is caring, you should try to do your best to share the DeDRMed version of the ebook if you got it from Amazon or when you're done with the physical book, scan it before reselling it, and upload it so that it will be easier for other people to find the book. Some good places to do so are [Library Genesis](https://www.gen.lib.rus.ec/) and any subreddit in [This Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/eebooks+mathbooks+csbooks+physicsbooks+econbooks/new/?sort=new).

Hopefully this will help you find most of your textbooks that you need for your classes and allow you to study without having to give even more money to the publishers who are trying to take advantage of our situation.

**Edit**: I understand that all of us need to find textbooks, but please go through all the methods listed here, and if you can't find it, there's a 99% chance that no one else can find it either. If it's possible, go ahead and buy it, DeDRM it from Amazon, and then return it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/3i9y7n/guide_for_finding_textbooks/,1440465529.0,411,0.98,149,Piracy,Amosqu

3bncow,YIFY: how much quality are you sacrificing. (comparisons inside),"This comparison was the result of a discussion with someone on releases by YIFY. The discussion was about the amount of quality you were losing by watching a YIFY release, as opposed to the real thing (remux/Blu-ray disc). The point is simply how much quality you're losing, nothing more than that.


The movie used for the comparison is **The Good, The Bad and The Ugly**. We used the US Blu-ray Disc, as this is the source of the YIFY encode. I need to mention that YIFY used the following x264 setting: *zones=128531,257062,q=40* which basically means the quality was severely reduced after frame 128531 until the end, which is roughly half of the movie. Finally, the YIFY release has an odd horizontal crop, but I can assure you that the frames match.


The following links will take you to http://screenshotcomparison.com/ which is a great site to compare screenshots. To be clear, it will show you the Blu-ray Disc in normal state and will show you the YIFY encode when you put your mouse/cursor on the image.

39qnll,"Guide for Microsoft Windows, Office and Adobe software","This subreddit gets the same questions almost daily, and I figured I could make a comprehensive post that would show up on search. 

Before I start, lets make some piracy related things clear:

* Never google anything related to cracks or activators or even torrents. Google deletes many ""good"" results due to DMCA notifications and for example the results for Daz Loader are only malware. Use Duckduckgo instead.

* Scene groups do not have ""official websites"". Those sites are likely to be scam. 

* If you feel like some cracks/activations seem unsafe and there is no way to find out how they work, then don't use them. 

* Learn what anti-virus programs' false positives mean and why do they occur.

* Go through the comments sections on torrent sites.

* Only VPN can keep you anonymous.

* Seed at least till ratio of 1 or you're a bitch!


**How to get Windows**

**Option 1**: Downloading it


Get an untouched ISO. Stay clear from pre-activated releases or those Russian art/re-skinned versions, because there is no way to be sure what sort of scripts they contain. ~~Problem here is that Microsoft does not publicly provide SHA-1 checksums so it is rather difficult to confirm the validity of your installation media. The medias are usually taken from Microsoft Developer Network, which only developers can access. You can only go through the internet and see if you find the SHA-1 by someone else, preferably on several different sites.~~

/u/gaviddinola has provided us with [link](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/hh442898.aspx#searchTerm=&amp;ProductFamilyId=545&amp;Languages=en&amp;PageSize=10&amp;PageIndex=0&amp;FileId=0) to the MSDN checksums! This is major advantage, big shout out for him/her :)

Note that the checksums do not correspond to ISOs with integrated updates.
I suggest using ISOs from user *murphy-78* on KAT/TPB. He releases a new ISO every month, so you don't have to install tens of updates, and leaves the windows files unaltered. 

EDIT: murphy78 has quit making integrated ISOs. A good alternative is Generation2. You can also **download Windows 10 ISOs from MS Tech Bench**.

EDIT MAY 2016: MURPHY IS BACK IN BUSINESS!

After you have your installation media, use a tool called [Rufus](http://rufus.akeo.ie) to make a bootable usb-drive. You then stick it to your computer and boot from the usb. You might need to change the BIOS settings to do this. You will need an 8Gb USB drive, since the Windows ISOs are usually about 4 Gb in size.


**Option 2**: Use the installation media creation tool from Microsoft
 

You can read more and download the program [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

**Option 3**: Microsoft Windows and Office ISO Downloader

[The ISO downloader by Jan Krohn](http://i.imgur.com/433icgv.png) can be used to download clean installation media from MS servers. It is constantly being updated. However, it cannot actually download Office installation media albeit the name so suggests.
Requirements: Win 7 or newer, .NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer, Internet Explorer 8 or newer

The tool's homepage is *heidoc.net*. Because the tool has good support and constant updates, I will leave the checksum away since it would need to updated so frequently.



**Activation:**

You can install volume channel Windows without product keys but not upgrade to a different version from an existing installation. Retail versions do not let you skip the product key input, but you may input a ""generic key"" while disconnected from the internet. Now, Microsoft has distributed its operating systems via different channels: OEM, retail and [Volume Licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_license_key). 

The latter means that same product key is used to license several operating systems. This is what corporations and governmental faculties use. They pay a subscription fee to Microsoft for unspecified amount of operating systems. Volume License keys are checked for validity for every 180 days through key management servers. 

OEM licenses are tied to the computer's motherboard and are sold to computer manufacturers. Retail keys are sold to end users and can be used several times. They can also be found for sale ""second hand"".

After you have installed Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise or any Windows 8.1 version(i.e any Windows that uses volume licensing), use Microsoft Toolkit ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/fBesF)) to activate it by pressing *EZ-Activate*. The tool works by creating a key management service emulator, which tricks the Windows into thinking it's genuine. It will also work even without internet connection. You will receive all the updates. MS Toolkit creates only one directory (C:\Windows\AutoKMS) and has other uses aside from activation. This in my opinion makes it better than KMSPico, and probably less prone to false positives from anti-viruses.

Latest version of MTK is 2.6.3

    EXE MD5: e01d03275b9be77dd08e7f141efbe059
    EXE SHA-1: c422fe44f61b234235e1bed793aefa88826275d6

Because Windows 7 Home Premium and Ultimate versions were only sold as OEM and retail, they cannot be activated with KMS emulator. Instead you will need to use Daz Loader, which tricks Windows by injecting system licensed internal code into the systems before Windows boots. Windows will then think it is installed on an OEM computer. PS: Windows 7 Enterprise is basically the same as Ultimate, and can be activated with MS Toolkit.

Latest version of Daz Loader is 2.2.2

    EXE MD5: 323c0fd51071400b51eedb1be90a8188
    
    EXE SHA-1: 0efc35935957c25193bbe9a83ab6caa25a487ada
    
Both MS Toolkit and Daz Loader have their official threads on MyDigitalLife forums.

EDIT: Another good KMS-activator is KMSAuto Net made by Ratiborus. If you cannot find the latest version alone, it will be included in the executable called ""KMSTools Portable by Ratiborus"".

    Version  :   1.5.3

**Office 2010/2013/2016**:

You can get either the retail or volume installation media.You can find Office checksums from MSDN. [Retail installer can be changed to volume channel installer with MS Toolkit](http://i.imgur.com/fP1R1SV.png) and you are then able to activate Office with it. KMSAuto can convert installed Office from Retail to Volume. 

There now exists a clever tool to install Office 2013/2016 from cloud. It installs Office Click-to-run which can be changed to volume channel and activated with KMS-emulation. The tool does this all.

**Adobe software:**

You can download the software from [Adobe website](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/creative-cloud-apps-download.html). Block adobelogin.com -script so you don't have to create Creative Cloud account (use NoScript browser add-on). Adobe software can also be found from any torrent site (**recommended author: m0nkrus**). You may then install them without having to sign in with CC account. 

There used to be a splendid program for Adobe product activation called [Adobe Tool.](https://imgur.com/a/BqZwP) It can still be used for blocking Adobe host files if you want to be extra sure your activation won't break. However the program is outdated and not usable for activation anymore. Luckily a new version is under development.

Now there are two options for Adobe activation, XForce keygen or AMT emulator.

**EDIT ON JUNE 2016

#There is now a new activator called [AMT Emulator](http://imgur.com/a/gCVAv) made by PainteR. It is by far the most advanced activator making the rest pretty much obsolete. It makes the software launch faster and is also able to change software interface language. Using it is similar to using Universal Adobe Patcher. Latest version is 0.9.2.

    File | Size | SHA-1 | 
---|---|----|----|----
amtemu.v0.9.2.win-painter.zip | 1.80 Mb | 4320BF75BE097090B3866D7DB9813CF4E2214993 |
amtemu.v0.9.2-painter.exe| 2.39 Mb | CAAD125358D2AE6D217E74CFCD175AC81C43C729 |
 amtemu.v0.8.1.mac-painter.dmg| 1.34 Mb | FA6A234DEC9BD736072D9E237CFD2993BA007E4C |



The [XForce keygen](http://i.imgur.com/9m9INVa.png) is used as follows:

* Turn off the internet
* During the Adobe installation, click ""I have a purchased a key"" 
* Generate the said key with keygen *and do not close the keygen*
* Open the Adobe program, it asks for activation, select activate now and go for offline activation with ""Having trouble connecting to internet?""
* The Adobe program will give you a request code, which you will paste to the keygenerator and you will then receive activation code
* Copy&amp;paste the activation code to Adobe program
* Block software in firewall
* Done!

Pros: activation without tampering any files, works on Mac OSX too

Cons: activation can be broken easily if the software is able to compare its licensing information with Adobe databases, ~~thus making it impossible to update the software~~, ~~no offline updates exist for anything other than trial versions~~

Offline updaters can now be found on http://prodesigntools.com/adobe-cc-2015-updates-links-windows.html
If you run them while offline, you shouldn't break the license. Adobe Update Management Tool can also be used install offline update packages to be extra safe.

EDIT: AUM Tool v8.0 can handle xforce activation too as long as you are not logged in with an CC account. For some reason Adobe software will detect your account even if you do not log in during the installation.

I have no idea what the official source for XForce keygen is (as it is a scene release), but fortunately keygens can be used sandboxed so you can look it up from torrent sites and try it safely.

Checksums for XFORCE CC v2015:

    SHA-256: E5ACE324E1E75AC1FB0BA4CD19297CC1D2B5A29694E5C6BD6C275B5F4A35BEE2
    
    MD5: F81A4B9D7E8DD8FE2927598A99798B67
    
XFORCE keygen for CC 2015 also works with CC 2017 software.

[The Universal Adobe Patcher](https://imgur.com/a/optMz) is used as follows:

* Turn off the internet!
* Install the Adobe software as trial
* After the installation, patch the .dll -file containing license information with UAP
* Block software with firewall
* Done!

Latest version of UAP is 2.0. The official source is user named PainteR from forum.ru-board.

    EXE SHA-1: 7D0D2B434B51ABE91E5B16E4C8DC8D26143B138C
    
Pros: software can be updated with Adobe Update Management Tool (even if software has detected a CC account), can be used to ""backup"" Xforce activation

Cons: if the activation fails, everything adobe related needs to wiped off the computer (Adobe software sees that trial has ended),  does not work with Mac OSX

This means it can be updated because there won't be license mismatches. PainteR has also made [Adobe Update Management Tool](http://i.imgur.com/j76BdDg.png) which allows you to install updates without Creative Cloud account. Latest version is 8.0. 
&gt;UMT is a shell around its own patched version of the Adobe Application Manager (AAM).

&gt;This enables UMT to bypass the license checks, and download and install any available update.

&gt;Applications installed as a part of a suite can be updated individually without restrictions.

&gt;No Adobe ID is required (for installing updates). Internet connection isn't required for offline updates.

There also exists unofficial one-click installers that install Adobe software straight as trial. If you use them, see that they do not install any adware alongside the Adobe products.

2oftbu,Guide: The idiot proof guide to downloading ebooks off IRC. With Pictures and everything!,"I'm putting this together because I posted a while ago about using IRC to acquire ebooks on Reddit, and there was a metric shit ton of interest from others in learning how to do it. Much of this info is available on the net, but it can be difficult to track down if you don't know exactly what to look for.

Disclaimer: I am in no way responsible for how you choose to use this knowledge. This method can and should only be used to download legally available ebooks, as an alternative source in case other services go down for whatever reason. You use this guide *at your own discretion*. 

Now then, to the good stuff.

**Q&amp;A**

&gt; Question: Why should you use IRC to acquire ebooks, there are so many different ways to get them! 

Answer: IRC is the best method to find ebooks. The quality is almost always high, the selection is extensive, and finding and downloading the books is quick and easy. Put simply, unless you happen to have access to a private site exclusively made for ebooks, you probably won't find a better source. 

&gt; Question: What do I need to make this happen?

Answer: A IRC client (I'll be using mIRC for the purposes of this guide, it's the simplest to use and the most widely distributed as well. Besides that, the ability to copy and paste, and a bit of common sense.



**Setup**

1. Now then, to begin, download a IRC client. I personally suggest [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/).

2. Once you do that, install it and open the client up. You should be greeted with a page like [This](http://i.imgur.com/TgSNg47.jpg). 

3. The first thing you want to do is write in a name that's unique enough to have not already been taken. For the purposes of this guide, I just choose something random.

4. Once that's done, you want to navigate down to ""Ignore"" section in the DCC options, and turn the box option to ""disabled"". This is to ensure that incoming files are not ignored, which is important if you actually want to receive your ebooks. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/sW0wptQ.jpg)

5. Next thing you want to do is scroll back up to the ""Servers"" tab and pick out a server. For ebooks, I know of two servers that host channels dedicated to ebook downloads. One is ""Undernet"", the other is ""IRChighway"". While both have their uses, IRChighway is the one you want to use 90% of the time. The selection is generally more robust, the channels are more stable, and the downloads are faster. You generally only want to use Undernet if you can't find the ebook you're looking for on IRChighway. Sometimes you can get lucky and one will have a book if the other does not. In any case, select you server by finding it in the drop down menu and double clicking it. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/82Cf1r7.jpg)


**Actually finding and downloading your ebooks**


6. Once you've done that, it'll take you back to the menu that I originally showed you. This time, click the connect button, and it'll connect you to the server and open a window offering you a chance to join a channel. Now, there are several channels you can join depending the server you're on. On Undernet, you can either go with ""Bookz"" or ""ebooks"", while on IRChighway, you can join ""ebooks"". Type in your channel and hit join. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/LKy6ZJE.jpg)

7. Once you've done that, you'll be presented with a channel window filled with a whole bunch of people typing in seemingly meaningless strings of text, none of them talking to one another. This can be intimidating, but **don't worry**, it's not hard to figure out! It's at this point that you need to know the commands to properly utilize the channels bots.

8. When you join one of the channels I listed, there will be channel bots you'll use to interact with the bots that you will be downloading from. To access the commands for these bots, use the ""@"" symbol followed by the command you need. 

To search for an ebook, Use 

&gt; @Search &lt;book name or author name&gt;

This will have the channel bot automatically search through it's index and return you a listing of the books available from the download bots in the channel. [It will look like this](http://i.imgur.com/hGvcGTg.jpg). As you can see, I searched for Romeo &amp; Juliet, and the bot went through its index and returned a list of potential downloads. Click the accept button to have it download. 

9. Once you've done that, go into the upper portion of mIRC, click tools, and go to the ""received files"" drop down. Click it. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/tWAMUPU.jpg)

10. This will open up your mIRC downloads folder, which should contain a .zip file of the list of download options that the bot sent you. Extract it and open it up in notepad. There will be a variety of download links available in many different formats. Find whichever book you're looking for, in whichever format you prefer (I like HTML because they're generally the best formatted and the format is universal for mobile devices) and copy the text string up til the the end of the file. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/sg1vYBd.png)

11. Once you've done that, go back to the mIRC channel window and simply paste the text string into the channel. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/6Q0TwXE.jpg)

12. Click enter, and wait for the bot to respond, and then click accept when a file transfer window comes up. I've highlighted my download query, and the bots response with relevant information for you. It should be pretty self explanatory. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/xz0HFXx.jpg)

13. And you're done! The file will be downloaded to your mIRC downloads folder in a zip or rar archive. Simply extract it and read it! 

Note 1: You can also use the command 

&gt; @find &lt;book or author name&gt; 

To search for your ebook if the channel bot is down or not responding quickly to the @search command. However I do not suggest this, as it gives you a clusterfuck of responses in your IRC client as personal messages. It can work, but only as a last resort. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/tQoL53F.jpg)

Note 2: I've used the public domain ""Romeo And Juliet"" for the purposes of this guide. This book is in the *public domain*, and thus is not subject to any copyright. Once again, I encourage you to *only* download public domain books, but cannot control (and am not responsible) for what you wish to download. 

Note 3: Edit. Damnit, Reddit fucked the formatting and keeps renumbering my list. Whatever, not a big deal I guess. It doesn't change the content of the guide at all. Just go down the list, everything is in the proper order anyway.


So, that's how you download ebooks off of IRC. Not so hard, is it?

c9dk9w,The Rise and Fall of Digital Game Ownership: My descent back into PC game piracy.,"I've been a PC gamer since the late 90s, back when I got addicted to the likes of Dungeon Keeper, Diablo, and Baldur's Gate. As a teenager, during the early 2000's I simply lacked the money to buy many games so I readily explored the worlds of freeware games, supposed *abandonware* sites, and all manner of console emulation. By the time I was an adult, I slowly started to get back into buying games for PC, with the likes of Oblivion, Fable, and Neverwinter Nights being my biggest jams.

Fast forward a couple of years and I am casually buying games, but readily avoiding this new-fangled rise of digital storefronts, with the clear feeling that services like Steam were just an unnecessary third party app to gate access to my games that was nothing more than fancily dressed DRM. All this changed however with a little game called Skyrim which didn't give me any bloody choice, if I wanted to play it, I had to install Steam. The rest, as we say, is history.

If I look back now, the last physical copies of PC games I bought were Skyrim (which is pretty worthless) and The Witcher 2. I got thoroughly sucked into the Steam machine. It was a very gradual thing at first, the first few years I had maybe 10 games all of which I played. This rapidly spiraled out of control.

From the years 2013 to 2016 I went full on rampage, buying up games on sale, buying game bundles, using key resellers, pre-ordering games, and turning from my old days of scouring the internet for half-way decent freeware to full on throwing money every payday at this behemoth, and in all honesty I can't say I regretted it. Sure for every bundle where I only played 1 out of 12 games, I felt I was getting value for my money. Steam as a platform, while still a DRM scheme, was a non-annoying one. It offered a lot of features to simplify matters, and at times I enjoyed just curating my game library more than actually playing it. Steam as a platform, offered plenty of value to me as a customer for me to consider it worth using.

As of the typing of this, my steam collection has grown to a gargantuan 1,043 games owned (with a wishlist that exceeds even that at 1,247!) of course of these games the amount played probably dwells close to 20% as much of my collection was padded through bundles, free game offers, and ridiculously cheap sales.

Of course it wasn't limited to Steam, I later heard about GoG an even more consumer-friendly platform, with admittedly less features but no DRM and access to many of the older games I always enjoyed. I racked up a library of 169 games on there as well (several of which were just imported from Steam through their GoG Connect program).

Then something flipped in my brain. You could say I just finally got fed up with the whole damn thing. The more I heard about every Tom, Dick, and Harry game publisher starting their own platform like Epic or EA or Bethesda, and even more looking into it. The concept of things like Stadia and game streaming. The myriad of trash offered on these platforms that I ended up paying for. I did everything I could to support small developers I felt worthy but ultimately I barely played 80% of my library. Despite being an extreme deal hunter I've given thousands of dollars to game companies and I just am getting... so very tired of it.

It's not even about money, I'm making more money now than I ever have previously, I have even more money I can throw at these companies, but the desire to curate this digital library of legitimately acquired games is waning.

The real tipping point for me though was downloading a stand-alone game again. I grabbed a Ren'py made Visual Novel game a few months ago and had an absolute blast with it, so much to the point it turned me onto trying over visual novels. As someone who greatly values content in games though I had such a hard time justifying the cost of these games which often had little in the way of gameplay, so I just fired up the old torrent program and started downloading.

The Steam Summer sale came up about a week ago, and I've been slowly working my way through my wishlist, trying to decide on what I want to get, and while there's certainly plenty I am interested in, I just have lost all taste for this game. I have no desire to spend anymore money on this, I love games, I love collecting them, I love playing them, but I don't want to keep playing this gamble where I buy games I may not even play or even like. It seems so silly to me that this of all things is where I just decided to throw my hands up. Am I done buying games legitimately? Certainly not, I am sure I will continue to buy games but I don't want to keep being a cog in this machine and just marching to this drum.

I've thrown thousands of dollars at Steam, GoG, and other storefronts this past 8~ years, and while I don't regret it really (I rarely regret things) I am done being so liberal with my money and just tossing it away, and I highly doubt I'm going to feel any regret or remorse for my pirating of games going forward.

c414dt,Why would anyone pirate something when companies make it so easy to use out the box?,"My new mouse wouldn't work except in BIOS for some reason and I could not get the drivers to install so I decided to reformat my PC.  

1. Try and download the ISO the Microsoft provided with the key I bought from them.  
2. Fail and search elsewhere, finding a page on Microsoft to download it after entering my key.  
3. Enter my Windows 7 Home Basic key, but it keeps throwing up an error.  
4. Try my Windows 7 Professional Upgrade key, it works, but the only two languages are Korean and French for the download??  
5. Try and find the ISO legit elsewhere, but the links were dead (turns out ublock was actually not playing nice with the websites but I didn't know this at the time).  
6. Go back to the French version, I'll just change the language when installing.  
7. Doesn't work. The only language selectable is French.  
8. Come back and get an ISO from elsewhere again.  
9. Got one. Reformat drive, install, spend of hours installing updates, drivers etc. and go to activate...  
10.  ""The upgrade key you entered is for an edition of Windows that does not work with Windows Anytime Upgrade. Enter a different upgrade key.""  
11. Okay. I tried to upgrade my Windows 7 Home Basic before actually activating it so I'll go activate it...  
12.  

    The product key you have entered will not work with this edition of Windows 7.  
    You must either run Windows 7 Setup or enter a Windows 7 Home Basic N product key.  
  
13. I apparently downloaded the ISO for Windows 7 Home Basic ***N*** rather than Windows 7 Home Basic so the key won't work. I'll just call Microsoft and explain the situtation so they can help somehow (take my old keys and give me a new key or something, I don't know, never had to deal with the support).  
14. ""Offices are now closed..."" damn I should have held on and found out when they open. I mean I thought they'd be open 24/7 (by patching me through to another countries support for activation help) but I'll just call back tomorrow. Now tomorrow...  
15. ""Offices are now closed blablabla"" - no opening time. I held and held waiting to see if anything but the automated machine just cut me off.  
16. Googled it, no opening hours for support. The page where the contact details is just has the telephone number and a link to ""Microsoft Support"", an automated chat bot that is ""still learning and only able to answer questions about Microsoft"" but not ""opening hours of customer support"".  
17. Since that's a dead end, I'll go try installing various hotfixes recommended all over the internet and retrying, disabling UAC...

I started pirating and reading books way back around 2008. It used to be that I could search for mostly any book and I would find easily a pirated copy online, either digital version or scanned copy. 

I don't pirate books anymore, unless there is no other choice. But these last couple of years, the amount of times I fail to find a book or an education material, like course for example is wayy too much. I wonder what has changed.. May be people aren't just interested anymore in pirating books... or may that content has just grown so much that pirates can't keep up with stuff anymore, so they only pirate what they think is worthy.

In stadia you have to buy the games and if you want to play in the highest settings you have to buy their $10/mo service too. It is like paying for your internet, the games and the service every month. Seriously. I would be much happy to spend money on a graphic card. Atleast i don,t have to face issues like lag and latency. What if my internet goes off. I would not be able to enjoy the games that i have paid for.No internet, no gaming. Its a no no for me.

bv16wu,Just discovered the wonders of Plex,"For the longest time, I pirated my movies in the traditional way, downloaded the torrent and opened the MP4 using my Intel NUC connected to my TV.

This all changed when I got a smart TV. I repurposed that NUC as a Plex server to try it out.

It's extremely easy and incredible, the best feature is the automatic metadata system so I don't even need to bother re-naming MP4 files. Not to mention it can be used through WAN with hardly any set up (tested in LTE) 


It's like a personal Netflix of pirated content. I wish I discovered this earlier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/bv16wu/just_discovered_the_wonders_of_plex/,1559265092.0,1231,0.97,426,Piracy,Alex_2259
buszxx,Piracy as the easiest solution to a weird problem,"So, a few days back, I decided that I'd like to play Skyrim - Special Edition on my new rig. Unfortunately, we had just recently moved and didn't have internet yet, so I couldn't just download it on my Steam account, and I sure wasn't gonna burn through my mobile data allowance for almost a dozen gigs of content

&amp;#x200B;

An opportunity presented itself with a gamer centric internet cafe a kilometer or so from home which had pretty stellar internet. So, I made my way there, and using the copy of Steam in their computers, I logged my account in (very rare probability of my account being accessed+2Auth) and proceeded to download the files for the game legitimately. After a slow 40 minutes, I made a Steam backup file of it, copied it to my external drive, and skeddadled home.

&amp;#x200B;

Excited to play, I tethered my phone's data connection to my PC and logged into Steam, ready to install Skyrim SE using the Restore function that was pointed to the files I had on my external drive. I was pretty confident that I'd made a rather clever workaround to my situation, so I sat back and let Steam install it to my computer. However, once it was all allocated, I had expected the game to be ready to play; rather there was an immediate download ongoing for a 5 GB update that the game needed. Panicking, I quickly shut off my data hotspot, and paused the download.

&amp;#x200B;

I mulled over what I had done wrong--confident that I had gamed the system in a legitimate way to serve my needs. I spent the next hour or so tweaking and fiddling with what I had, trying to install Skyrim SE without needing that awful update. Alas, I was defeated, and I resigned myself to heading back to the internet cafe to download a FitGirl repack, with a separate 1.5 GB update to the most recent version of the game. This took around 15 mins or so all in all, and within the hour, I was back at home running a functional, standalone, and up to date version of Skyrim Special Edition 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -- Tried to do the proper way, got headaches. Argh matey way, smooth sailing.

&amp;#x200B;

ADDENDUM:

&amp;#x200B;

I actually managed to make the Steam version work by copying the deprecated FitGirl version to the cafe's steamapps folder, having it recognized as existing Skyrim SE game files, had it update to the latest version, and took those up to date files home, which my PC recognized and installed without any extraneous and large downloads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/buszxx/piracy_as_the_easiest_solution_to_a_weird_problem/,1559221936.0,64,0.81,5,Piracy,ThunderDaniel
buqgo8,Piracy should be fundamentally justifiable if original works of media aren't preserved by their original owners. A mild rant.,"So as with many piracy supporters on here, piracy for me was always less about getting free 4k rips of Marvel films, and more about getting pieces of complete media that are otherwise impossible to find directly from its original source.

Copyright laws, while understandable in many respects, can be absurd in certain situations.

Case in point. I recently decided to finally watch Daria after seeing her appearance in Beavis and Butthead. I ended up binging the whole show completely legally on Hulu, and then buying one of the movies on Amazon.

While searching for a rip of the movie, because I was admittedly too cheap to pay for it at first, I found out the version of Daria I was watching was a total fucking sham.

The original airing of Daria on MTV had a fuck ton of licensed music from the era. It's like stepping into a late 90's time machine, and completely changes the viewing experience.

The DVD release and later streaming services use a vanilla version with almost ALL of the licensed music cut. I'd have to brush up on my copyright law, but a movie or television show usually has perpetual license to use those songs unless specifically stated in a contract.

My only assumption with Daria, is perhaps when they signed the rights to the music, it was temporary, or packaged in with a deal to play those artists on the network at the time.

Which isn't necessarily MTV's fault for being so short sighted in the late 90s, BUT today, this odd licensing ruined the historical significance of a cultural icon of the late 90s. I wouldn't have even known the show used this music if I didn't stumble upon a forum. 

This brings me to my next point. So remember I said movies and television usually have those perpetual licenses? Well video games, for some reason, don't operate like film in terms of re-releasing licensing holding content. 
Any Grand Theft Auto fan here probably knows that Rockstar will send updates to the games on PC and modern consoles to remove licensed tracks they're too cheap to renew on. 

So if you have Vice City on your old PS2 or Xbox, you're safe. If you have it on a physical PC disc, you should be okay too. You have those perpetual licenses for that content. 

However, since copyright law is a finicky thing, when selling a game continuously online through digital markets, you have to keep those licenses updated. 

So disregarding bug fixes or balancing, a game you played 3 years ago may be different than the one you play today. 

You can't play an authentic game of GTA Vice City if you buy it on Steam right now. It's a shell of its former self, and that's where pirating comes in. 

Us, pirating our content, or perhaps holding onto our old physical media, is just all of us trying to preserve history and nostalgia accurately. 

Last night, I can't believe I technically had to download 15 gigs of illegally restored Daria episodes because MTV fucked up the licensing agreements 20 years ago and won't ever fix it. 

If a judge had me in court today to pay ""damages"", I'd say the only crime here is not doing justice to the history and legacy of the original broadcast of the show. I'm not damaging anything, because I didn't even steal something MTV is currently offering. 

I suppose the Star Wars fan remasters/edits are similar to this as well. 

The same could be said for gamers restoring music to Grand Theft Auto. 

LGR, one of my favorite retro electronics YouTuber goes out of his way to preserve and document old 80s and 90s software. God knows the licensing grey area nightmare for those old games and programs. 

The point of this rant I suppose, is I could do everything in my power to legally obtain media I want to watch, and it still end up not being what I expected as a consumer. 

If I buy Daria in 2019, I should get the Daria from 1997. If I buy Vice City in 2019, it should be the same Vice City as I played in 2002 god dammit. 

I get stealing media is illegal because it undermines profits from folks who worked hard on things. I wouldn't want to screw over my favorite artists or directors either. However, it gets to that grey legal/moral area of, I'm taking this peice of media the creators don't even offer anymore. 

There's so many examples of this. I could rant about all of them. Hell, remember that post yesterday on Reddit about how Halo is losing its historical originality due to porting issues? 

I get some of ya'll just want to illegally watch Thanos's ballsack chin in 4k. Blurays are expensive as hell. However, I think that there are much deeper seated ethical issues with copyright and copyright law at play here.

Edit: Grammar fixes from sausage fingers.

brwjl1,It’s kinda ridiculous how premium website that offer paid content is a humungous downgrade compared to piracy in almost every retrospect,"I got 3 months for free of now TV with McDonald’s monopoly. I decided to try out the website, as it’s normally £14.99 per month, and my god. 

For £14.99, not only do you get a limited selection of content that all can expire and never return at any given point in time, but you also get an advert that you can only skip after 10-15 seconds for Every.  Single.  Episode. 

You ALSO cannot change the video quality. I have an extremely fast interest connection, and all of the videos played from NowTV played at 360p. That’s it. There’s no way to change the quality, and after contacting support, they told me it was my internet connection. I also found out on the live chat, that even if your quality is somehow at maximum, you’ll still only be able to play the videos at a maximum resolution of 720p. 

What. The. Fuck.

£14.99, for a website that barely had any content, has unskippable video adverts, and doesn’t even play the video in the correct quality.

So I just went to a torrent site and downloaded the entire series within 15 minutes, in a much higher quality, no ads, no bullshit. 

How are websites like this so anti consumer, and why do people pay for this shit?

&amp;#x200B;

Please download the linked files before beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

First, make sure that your internet connection is disabled.

To begin, uninstall any spotify version that you had installed before.

After that, install the [1.4 spotify](http://upgrade.spotify.com/upgrade/client/win32-x86/spotify_installer-1.1.4.197.g92d52c4f-13.exe).

Run the [downgrade.bat](https://github.com/master131/BlockTheSpot/raw/master/downgrade.bat) with admin permissions.

Then, run [install.bat](https://github.com/master131/BlockTheSpot/raw/master/install.bat) from the zip file. (also with admin perms) (I don't know if the [netutils.dll](https://github.com/master131/BlockTheSpot/raw/master/netutils.dll) needs to be in the same directory as the install.bat.)

Activate your internet connection again.

bjxlpe,"MASSIVE Project Update For Solidtorrents, Fake torrents filtered out and more","How are you guys? Hope you are doing well,

I have good news, Solid torrents just got  Better!

From now on solidtorrents will Filter Out The potentially unsafe torrents from search results, we worked hard in developing the algorithm needed to classify torrents with fake seeders. and after doing intense testing, finally, We are presenting this update.

&amp;#x200B;

**You might be thinking why are such paranoid about fake torrents?**

Hackers with bad intent create this kind of fake torrents to spread computer viruses by publishing totally fake torrents and make them look like very popular and quality content. and they also trick other torrent search engines to rank those torrents higher than original contents, they do this by artificially increasing the seeder and leecher count. and make them look like a very high-quality torrent.

&amp;#x200B;

But no more! With this update, we are trying to totally eliminate those bad torrents from search results. Here is how.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introducing ""Potentially Bad Torrents"" Filter on solitorrents**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3c1v0pdw0uv21.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e131f3dafbc23060350060d3afa27f3f979d2c22

This is a game changer for all torrent users. This filter will automatically filter out this type of fake torrents from search results. This filter will be enabled by default on solid torrents.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's try by searching and see the difference between results.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's search for a software called ""photo\*\*\*p"" it is a very proper software. and it should be around 1-1.5Gb in size. let's compare the search with the filter off and off.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atjdfyux0uv21.png?width=1786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49ce632df280a2c617530d85fd27bf9ba50c12e

Let's start by turning off the filter.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pdkcurlz0uv21.png?width=1789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fdb72b7bfc94bc508633508ad406f27c124eece

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's turn on the filter and do the same search again!

As you can see most of the torrents in the results are under 20MB, and as we know it is near impossible to compress a 1.5Gb file in less than 20 Mb so it is clear that most of the torrents are content fake torrents. Let's do the same search with the filter on.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see this time it returned much better results. Decide yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

**please try and comment what do you think about it?**

**and as always, please let us know what features would you like to see added in solid torrents? How can we improve solid torrents? It would be very helpful for us to improve this project.**

&amp;#x200B;

Check it out now!

biwzbd,Stop using closed-source activators,"I see this being recommended all the time, people saying ""use MTK/KMS auto/HWIDGen/etc""

It makes me cringe because you have virtually no idea what is included in the emulator source, it could be logging your details, spying on what you do, etc.

It's not very well known (outside of /g/ anyways) that an open source KMS emulator exists:

https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd

(I suggest cloning the source, because the issues suggest github might take it down soon)

If you don't understand how to use it, you can take a look at this repo (which was previously posted here months ago, but was deleted) which basically automatically activates it for you by using a batch file +  OpenVPN TAP driver to install it:

https://github.com/ekistece/vlmcsd-autokms/releases

It will ask you for the key for your version of windows, there's a txt file with KMS keys included. If the KMS key isn't included, microsoft provides a full list of them [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys)

I myself made a modified version of the batch installer, but if you head to the releases section of that repo it should work fantastic, I would always suggest compiling the binaries yourself (for ultimate safety), but that version is fine and appears to be clean.

EDIT:
Here's the modified version of the batch installer I use (and It's worked fantastic for me):
https://pastebin.com/dK1mBVE7

EDIT 2:
Getting your binaries from the proper sources is a pretty sure-fire way to ensure you're safe, but if you're 100% for security you can do what this post is saying.

In an interview with Deadline this week, he spoke about alleged links between pirate sites and malware distributors. He also indicated that* **warning people about the dangers of pirate sites has become Hollywood’s latest anti-piracy strategy**.""  

"" *""It has gone from an ethical discussion to a dangerous one. Now, your parents’ bank account can be raided, your teenage daughter can be spied on in her bedroom and extorted with the footage, or your computer can be locked up along with everything in it and held for ransom.""* ""  

""*Nigam’s stance isn’t really a surprise since he’s currently working for the Digital Citizens Alliance as an advisor. In turn,* **the Alliance is at least partly financed by the MPAA**.""

bcbzka,Scrubbin' is complete.,"For those who didn't see it yet, as a community we have decided to ""scrub the deck"" so to speak, and delete all comments and posts older than 6 months from /r/piracy. [Please find the whole explanation and link to the voting here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b4pkwp/scrubbin_the_deck/). (For those interested in doing the same to their sub, you can find the final version of the script I used [in github](https://github.com/db0/subredditScrubber))

I just wanted to let you all know that ~2 days ago my script finally finished scrubbing this sub so we should hopefully avoid getting DMCA'd for content someone posted years ago. This still means we have to stay vigilant and very proactive on what we remove, even if it is obviously bullshit that, say, the name of a scene release is a ""copyright violation"". 

It's bad enough that Reddit doesn't care to filter obvious bullshit DMCAs , but the fact that they threatened to take down the whole sub over them takes the cake. Nevertheless, this is what it is, so act and report accordingly.

Just as standard regular a reminder, we *do* have a [fallback](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b2fte3/the_fallback/) forum in [raddle's /f/piracy](https://raddle.me/f/Piracy) and the rules there are more lax than here. So if you're interested in getting news of new scene releases and general help in a specific site, you should already start using it as those kind of posts are not removed.

If you do not like raddle for any reason, I have already suggested 2 different completely distributed alternatives that I favour. You can find them in [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq) along with information on our current sub state. Please refer people to the wiki page whenever they inquire about this kind of things.

switched from galaxy s6 to the iPhone X and while it is fast and great filled with features I'm witnessing crippling restrictions. 

I made a post in the iPhone forum about it but was met with alot of bias over shadowing the answers.

It seems barbaric that I need to download itunes on pc, rip some album from YouTube, upload it there then download to my phone.

b9orhk,"Questions about Win10 LTSB, KMS38 and traceability","I’m about to do some good in the world and help to image and set up hundreds of used PC’s to be sent to a third world country. Here they will be used for education, business, training etc. etc.

Some of the hardware is fairly low spec, and we are going to standardize on Win10. In the interests of keeping hardware requirements low (especially RAM usage), I think LTSB will be the best way to go. As there’s 100s of PCs we also want to keep costs down by licensing Win10 for free, if possible.

These computers will have no internet access when they get to their destination. As I’m working for a charity, I need the fact that they’ll have a license obtained by non-legit means to be as untraceable as possible. So:

- If I went with 2019 LTSB and ran KMS38, does this need internet access periodically to stay activated until 2038? Or will the only time it checks again be 2038? I don’t want these PCs to become de-activated in a few months due to no internet access.

- What remains on the PC with KMS38 to indicate that this “crack” is in use?

- Going the HWID route seems far less traceable as it embeds the licence in the BIOS. What are my options for edition here? Home and Pro, but does Enterprise non LTSB work?

- If I still wanted LTSB, I would need to find the 2016 version as I read this works with HWID, correct?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b9orhk/questions_about_win10_ltsb_kms38_and_traceability/,1554454547.0,237,0.95,63,Piracy,xxplosiv

1: Just start downloading the files that you want, normaly, copy the link on mega, and paste on the megalinkupload, dont open the ultra surf yet. Then, after that you will notice the most of the downloads will get the ''over quota'' message.

2: and here's the joke, you just have to click on all downloads that has that error, right click&gt;stop then, then you open UltraSurf, wait a bit for the program gets done, and then you click to download again, here's the thing: Your downloads will be with another error, but how do you solve that error? Just close ultrasurf and click on the second option that will apper.

3:After that, you redo this proccess every time that you get cucked ( i recommend you downloading at least 5 videos ( if is this that you are downloading ) or watever your connection can take, so you dont need to open and close UltraSurf over and over again.

And this is it, sorry for my bad english and i hope that i helped the ones that didnt knew about that.

b6shtq,How to spot fake torrents and stay protected,"This is for those who are either new to this sort of thing or are curious as to how safe file sharing is.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1-(Specific to TPB)- Look for the pink and green jolly roger. Pink means the uploader has a trustworthy track record although they can go rogue at any time they usually like keeping their reputation on the site. Green is even better, they're VIP uploaders meaning the group who released the content are usually being uploaded by them personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2- Check the uploaders history. Each torrent is uploaded by a user, every so often a new user spams the site with popular content with a large amount of seeders. These torrents are almost certainly packaged with malware, i learned that the hard way. These uploaders usually dont last more than a day before the mods or admins take care of it. However some may slip through the cracks for a little longer depending on the site in question and its respective quality control, but for the most part they never last long. 

 An example of this was someone who spammed the site with over 30 different fake torrents all within a day and all having a similar amount of seeders. Its a good practice to avoid newer up loaders if you can when it comes to .exe or script based content but this can apply to all content.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3- Check the comments but dont necessarily take them as facts. Every so often a certain torrent might trigger a false positive with other users antiviruses. Do to the nature of some content this can be a false positive of sorts. Like i said they might not be correct but if you want to play it safe take them into consideration. If you decide to chalk such comments down to false positives take #4 into consideration

&amp;#x200B;

\#4-Have a reputable virus scanner. I would recommend Malwarebytes. The free version gets the job done just as well as the premium version. Once you have your content dont be afraid to scan it before running it, maybe something dubious is lurking in there. This can also produce false positives but for the most part its a reliable method of making sure what you have is legit.

 An example of a false positive would be videogame trainer programs. They act like a virus in the sense that its a ""hack tool"" in order to manipulate the game. Most virus scanners appropriately label them as such so you can decide for yourself what you want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\#5- Disconnect from the internet when installing programs. Just encase something managed to sneak by, its a good idea to block internet access when installing programs. After its installed run your virus scanner again and see if anything new shows up. Consider restarting and scanning as well. In fact i recommend scanning your system frequently regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion most of the top torrent sites have the quality control to deal with fake torrents but unless they can react to every fake out there instantly some will make their way to visitors eyes for a short time. But if your familiar with the ecosystem of these websites you can avoid falling victim to these traps.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone can learn something from this and if you have any other recommendations for this list drop them in the comments for everyone to see.

My concern is since we only provide them the finished output files and do not share their wireless network or their LAN network. We have completely independent local and wireless network and only share the final output files through emails/wetransfer/dropbox etc.

How can they detect the licensing status of our software? Can they do this by looking at the output file? Could the output file have any metadata regarding the licensing details of the creator's software?

BTW the client is working on a multi-billion dollar project and they might have a savvy IT department to investigate such things.

b4o96a,Confessions of a lifelong pirate.,"#  Warning kinda long, I left out many details to be brief

I have been a pirate longer than many of you have been alive. The first game I pirated that was “Spy vs. Spy” by First Star Software on the Commodore 64 in 1984. I might have started sooner but floppy disk drives were expensive back then. I bought the “Ultrabyte v2” disc nibbler to make a copy of the protected disk. It was probably only able to copy one more thing before becoming obsolete. Later, me and my buddy both got dial up modems and learned of pirate bbs’s though the public chat rooms of an online service “Quantam Link” which eventually became “America Online”.  In  a couple of years we had our pirate BBS and more games and software than we could play. It could also be a scary time also, back then. When people got busted back, usually for illegal long distance codes or running a pirate bbs. It was the government that came after you! You would hear about an online friend who got busted. Back then they came to your house and seized all your computer equipment and papers as evidence. Depending on who it was, you started sweating bullets, shit, he knows my real name and has my phone number, did the feds find it, because often times if they did they would bust they next guy down the chain.

I later got a Commodore Amiga and began again. By the time I got my second Amiga with a hard drive I had a US Robotics HST modem. It was about 6 times faster average peoples. A USR modem was essential to be a pirate back then; most boards would not let you connect without one.  I become an official runner for a few pirate boards. Unlike today everything was ratio driven or credits with nothing free.  

Over the years I have been and often and on pirate. Occasionally pirating movies, games, application, roms, audio books, music, service manuals for cars, most everything at one point. Someone gave me my first Kindle and didn’t feel like paying for books, so I started eBook piracy.

Within the last several months have decided I need to up my game again and get back into the scene much more actively. Its a lot easier now then it was way back then for the most part. You have public trackers, IRC, ect. Only when you move into the private trackers and such do things get complicated.  

Do I still have to pirate? No I could pay for it if I wanted to and do for many things. I am just a career pirate who never stopped. Nor do I plan to *ever*.  I don’t really feel guilt or remorse for what I have done or do, I guess I got over that years ago.   It’s still a thrill to be able to get something hard to find. And even more to help others, giving out floppy disks, loading eBooks on to kindles for those who can’t, breaking Firesticks, seeding a torrent with anime so some kid can watch it for free because their folks can’t afford everything.

b43khw,The Nuclear Option,"Hey eveyone, y'all know [our current predicament](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/), so I won't repeat ourselves completely. 

What you might have missed however is [the further update from the admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/eitku9s/) where they explain that effectively they were hitting us with multiple DMCA takedowns for content posted years ago and that we're supposed to scrub out the historical /r/piracy archive of the past 10 years to avoid losing the whole sub!

As you might imagine, this is impossible for the volunteer mods, and probably impossible for reddit staff themselves, which is why they rely on the crappy DMCAs scrapper bots instead. We know this, they know this, but obviously this is not a good-faith demand on their end...

Since this is impossible to achieve, the suspension of this subreddit is a question of 'when', not of 'if'. However I saw someone suggest something that might just work at best or buy us a bit more time at worst.

**We scrub everything from this sub going further back than 6 months**. 

This would be able to catch most possible infringing content, it would show the reddit admins that we put a good faith effort to follow their request, and with a stringent enough moderation, we should be able to avoid future potential triggers. 

The cons is of course that we lose historical content, but I doubt anyone is actually using the search function here to look for stuff, and most important guides have been captured already, and if not, you should go ahead and do so anyway!)

**So this is your call to decision-making**. I don't have a good way to tally votes while avoiding brigades and shit, so I can only promise I'll make an effort to see which way the wind is blowing around here. 

PS: dysgraphical is of the opinion we shouldn't be doing this and keep things as-is right now. I'll let them state their own justification as I don't want to put words in their mouth by mistake.

There is a one thing to take in account the quality may get compressed. That's all.

Step 1. Download a software called md5 hash changer. Also known as hash manager. Why you ask? Because you need to change the md5 hash of all the files or video you want to upload so they not get flagged.

Step 2. Create a separate Gmail account you need a separate just believe me.

Step 3. Make sure your account is all setup. Which means after creating Gmail account open all the Google product like drive Gmail and gphotos. Just open and don't do anything yet.

Step 4. Go to gdrive and then settings icon&gt;&gt;scroll and check Create G photos folder. Now got to gphotos again settings. First select unlimited storage and also check sync gdrive.

Step 5. Download google drive backup and sync on you pc. Sign-up with new G account. It will ask you to select folders. Uncheck already selected folder creat a new one and then select that folder. Make sure you dont have anything in it. Now when clicking next select unlimited free storage and also make sure to select upload all photos and videos to google photos (Main step don't forget). Also uncheck sync gdrive with pc(so if you deleted on pc it stays on cloud). 

Step 6. Use hash manager software to change md5 hash. It will depend upon the size of file that how long it will take to change the md5. Be patient. Don't Skip this step or your file will be removed if its get flagged and believe me it will get.

Step 7. after changing md5 simple move the file to the folder you select when setting up your backup and sync. 

After it will be uploaded to your account  all the files will be available in Google drive recent tab. And No it will not take your Google drive space.

How i know? I have over 11 thousand videos up their so believe me.

After the video get's uploaded you can simply delete them from your pc. A popup will appear which will ask you to remove the files from cloud or download back to your pc just ignore that shit.

And walah!! You have a fucking shit load of videos hosted for free and no they will not be deleted. Unless, of course you share the files publically.

And the best part is that you can access all those file from your mobile phone. Fucking win win.

Edit: this will only work for photos and videos. For other files you upload it will count against you gdrive storage.

Also if you are mobile user download photos app from store and use that to upload to your gphotos account. The files you upload to gphotos will also be visible in your gdrive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b2o9me/unltimate_cloud_storage_guide/,1552944075.0,52,0.83,38,Piracy,amrinderghumman

b2fte3,The fallback,"Hey all, as you should have seen by now, [reddit has started creating an excuse to take /r/piracy down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b28d9q/rpiracy_has_received_a_notice_of_multiple/). Unfortunately there's not much the mods can do about this approach, but I won't rehash things.

Instead I wanted to put another reminder about what options there are to migrate since this is the question on everyone's minds.

As I said before, [my first choice is raddle](https://raddle.me/f/Piracy). It's been linked on the sidebar for a while now.

Why raddle? Because it's a decent reddit-like alternative run by anarchists [with a strong security culture](https://raddle.me/wiki/privacy_policy) and an [intact warrant cannary ](https://raddle.me/wiki/warrant_canary). I've already been made a mod there so you know what to expect. 

You'll notice that of course it doesn't have nearly as much traffic as /r/piracy does, this is to be expected as nobody is actually using it while it's still just a fallback. As like when I started trying to grow this sub back in the day, it falls on us to start using it already. Start crossposting and shit.

Why raddle over other alternatives, like Voat? Because places which advertise themselves simply as ""anti censorship"" as their main draw, end up in one of two ways. Either they use ""anti-censorship"" as a way to draw users while they quickly abandon this rhetoric once the server costs or greed become high enough that they start trying to attract advertisers (e.g. see: Reddit). Or they take such a blanket view on free speech, so that the hate speech takes over the site as every marginalized person flees from the constant abuse (e.g. see Voat).

Raddle is not about freeze peach the way the others are, it's unashamedly anarchist and therefore does not tolerate hate speech, while at the same time doesn't care about pleasing advertisers. If you just want to talk about piracy, it's objectively the best option. Finally, as I said before, I'm the mod there and I'm at least ""known quality"".

As an alternative to raddle, and if you don't want to rely on one specific site again, I want to suggest also [Aether](https://getaether.net/dlstarted/) or [scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/). It's a decentralized social network where your content will not be taken down by someone else.

I won't lie, It's much harder to use effectively, but I'm already there as well and posting in #piracy. It's better than simply disintegrating.

I won't write about other options as I don't know them. Imho it's best to avoid too many alternatives as it's counter-productive, but feel free to post in this thread about your suggestions and their pros/cons and I'll try to keep things tidy.

Finally, as you might have seen, dysgraphical who's been doing the lion's share of the mod work around here doesn't plan on migrating anywhere else, which is sad as this place wouldn't have lasted nearly as long without them. Feel free to try and convince them. otherwise ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b2fte3/the_fallback/,1552895236.0,738,0.97,382,Piracy,dbzer0

b28d9q,r/Piracy has received a notice of multiple copyright infringements from Reddit Legal,"Yikes. 

This is especially awkward considering the top post on the our frontpage right now is a TorrentFreak article citing my best efforts to curb away copyright infringement on this community. Lets get down to what's going on.


#Who?
On March 14th (9:26 PM UTC) we received a modmail from a Reddit Admin with the following message. 

&gt;Dear Moderators,

&gt;TL;DR: This is an official warning from Reddit that we are receiving too many copyright infringement notices about material posted to your community. We will be required to ban this community if you can't adequately address the problem.

&gt;First, some background.

&gt;1. Redditors aren't allowed to submit material that infringes someone else's copyrights.
&gt;2. We (the Reddit admins) are required by law to process notices from people who say that material on Reddit violates their copyrights. The process is described in the DMCA section of the Reddit User Agreement.
&gt;3. The law also requires us to issue bans in cases of repeat infringement. Sometimes a repeat infringement problem is limited to just one user and we ban just that person. Other times the problem pervades a whole community and we ban the community.

&gt;This is our formal warning about repeat infringement in this community. Over the past months we've had to remove material from the community in response to copyright notices 74 times. That's an unusually high number taking into account the community's size.

&gt;Every community is different, but here are some general suggestions.

&gt;1. Consider whether your community's rules encourage or tolerate infringing content, and revise if necessary to be more clear.
&gt;2. Actively enforce your community's rules. If you need help, recruit more moderators to help.
&gt;3. Remove any existing infringing content from your community so Reddit doesn't get new notices about past content.
If you can't adequately address the problem, we'll have to ban the community.

&gt;Sincerely, Reddit Legal

#What?
This was my initial response to the modmail. Reddit Legal states that they have acted 74 times on these copyright notices through removals, but it is the first time we have been officially contacted regarding any infringement where it be through modmail or PMs. Considering our stringent rules against distributing pirated content through this platform, it is unclear what constitutes *copyright infringement* to Reddit or whether the simple mention of a release name falls under their broad interpretation. Another issue with this is that as moderators, we do not have the ability to see when a user or Admin deletes content. While ""admins*"" show up as a moderator in our moderation logs, there are 0 actions listed. This means that Admins can remove content at their own discretion and leave behind no notice or log for moderators. We cannot take any precautionary or preventative measures if we do not know what was removed.

#Where?

As of now, we are unaware where all these infringements took place. Were they regular posts? Crossposts? Comments? PMs? We reached out via email inquiring on the most recent DMCA notices and Reddit's Legal Support replied:

&gt;Hello,

&gt;The most recent DMCA notices we processed (which led to the removal of content from your community) came from Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.

&gt;Regards,

&gt;Reddit Legal Support

We replied immediately requesting a list of offending material that was removed and have not received a reply yet.


#When? Why?

Reddit Legal states that these repeated infringements occurred ""over the past months"" but the timeline isn't concrete in helping us analyze when it occurred and through what means. It is also convenient that Reddit has permitted this number of DMCA notices to accumulate without reaching out to us at all. Had Reddit warned us earlier, we would have had ample time to revisit our current rules or make adjustments on what sort of content is permitted. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

#What now?

It has become abundantly clear in the past months and years that Reddit has never been the bastion of freedom that many people see it as. The many subreddit purges that have occurred in the past few days further confirm it. Reddit's passivity in enforcing its own rules is continuously tested whenever one of its subreddits are thrusted into the limelight by the media. As we wait for more information from Reddit Legal, there is one certainty that comes from all of this,

r/Piracy will be banned. 

It is a matter of when. While we continue moderating the community to the best of our ability, should Reddit continue expanding its definition of copyright infringement and blindly react to every false copyright notice, this community's days are counted - not just us, but the many other related communities that openly permit the discussion of digital piracy or encourage it. 


We will continue communicating with Reddit Legal in hopes that we can identify what content broken infringement but it would be naive to expect this will be the last time we hear from them.

b1y36k,How did scene-based games piracy work in the analogue era? (e.g. Spectrum 48k and CBM64),"In the 1980s we used to pass copied tapes between us at school that were recorded by connecting two portable cassette recorders together (ear to mic) and the whole process was very hit and miss and you could take several attempts and messing about with levels before you could get a working copy (this was all before dual cassette hifi machines were available!).

I know how things work in the digital era, but I've often wondered how scene based activities were organised in the early 80s when everything was analogue and I was too young to be involved. How did they avoid all the 'playground problems' that we used to have with deteriorating quality of third/fourth hand recordings? How did they deal with the 'turbo loaders' (first one I recall was on Daley Thompson's Decathlon) which made the tape to tape method quite tricky?

I'm sure the younger reddit readers won't be interested in this, but as someone who has spent nearly 40 years doing this, i'd like to know more about that was happened at a scene level when I was just doing hit and miss home based piracy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/b1y36k/how_did_scenebased_games_piracy_work_in_the/,1552774675.0,52,0.9,25,Piracy,Spud_work

Anyways to start you are going to need to  run notepad as a admin. Which you can do easily by making a shortcut for notepad. Then you can run as admin.

az5yfx,"I've been anti-copyright for 15+ years, but the issue just got real for me as a game creator, and I feel like I'm missing something.","I was part of the ""InfoAnarchy"" movement back in the day, and I even authored innovative file sharing software back then (http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/), along with helping to fight the RIAA lawsuits.

Since then, I've been releasing all of my work into the public domain, including my commercially successful video games.  I'm a rare creator who has a successful game on Steam that is also on GitHub (full code and content).

(The business model is $20 for an account on the official servers in this online-only game, which is why ""pirating"" the game really isn't possible, and I can give the game client itself away, but it can't be used to play on my servers without paying.)


It suddenly got real for me when another developer wanted to make a mobile version, and I didn't want to be involved, so they went ahead to make it independently from me, given that it was in the public domain.  The mobile version became VERY popular in Japan and now China, to the point of easily overshadowing my original game in those places.

And there were also some issues with credit in China, where the mobile devs mistakenly (or fraudulently) proclaimed sole authorship over the entire game.  The Chinese publisher is also registering a copyright for the game in China, and also potentially trademarking the name there (the name that I invented, One Hour One Life, or the closest Chinese translation of that).  Not that these actions are valid, but they'd still be something that I would need to fight.

Since I made the original game 100% by myself, including all graphics hand-drawn on paper, all sound effects made with my own voice, and piano music improvised by me, all client and server code written by me, it is a very personal game.  You can see here in the trailer that the trailer even stars me, talking directly to the audience:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4JktcVQuE

That's a drawing of the hat I wear in real life!

And I'm drawing and adding new things to the game each week---part of my promise to players, and what they're getting for $20, is regular content updates.  Well, the knock-off mobile version can stay one step behind me, copying all the new stuff too, and adding it into their version.  Their audience effectively thinks they are working hard to create all this new stuff, but really it's me, slaving away.


So now it seems pretty likely that my work, my personal creation, will be swept away from me through the actions of this ""knock-off"" version, and maybe other knock-off versions in the future.  They could very well erase my claim of authorship from the public's mind, if their version continues to blow up, and they continue to claim sole authorship.  (And my version has sold very well, so I'm not complaining financially.)  I could be left as just a footnote, even though I did all of the work.  Every friggin' pen line!


I've asked them to correct these problems, and they are kinda listening, and taking some steps.  But the work is in the public domain, so what right do I even have to ask?

My whole adult life, I essentially believed this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4

Of course, all the creative people around me were like, ""Dude, you're crazy, some company is going to steal your work and make huge profits off of you.""

I've always acknowledged the financial-risk component of that, and can live with it, but I didn't really foresee the authorship/legacy part of it.  Everyone either thinks that I helped to make the knock-off, and that it's official, or that the knock-off is the original.  (They're also adding stuff to the game that I didn't approve, so having people mistakenly believed that I approved those changes is troubling.)

Of course, everyone who's giving me advice currently is saying, ""Duh, this is what copyright and trademark are for!  To prevent exactly this situation.""

I'm thinking that maybe ""moral rights"" or even libel are at issue instead (they're lying in a way that damages my reputation as a game designer).  But everyone says, ""No, it's just a copyright issue.""

So, I'm looking for a Pirate perspective on this issue.

Copyright sucks for a whole heap of reasons.  Have I discovered the one reason why it doesn't suck?  Or am I missing something?

How would we deal with this issue if we got our wish, and copyright was abolished?

Some game developers might need more money than others, some publishers are greedier than others, but you're free to support whoever you like. Just remember that you vote with your wallet and each sale has it's own ""weight"", and changes the industry slowly, be it for better or worse.

I personally know a lot of people who think that buying games (especially games) is worthless and straight up refuse to do it even when they spend hundreds of hours playing it. And then they go and joke about other people who actually pay for the games they're playing, not realizing that if it wasn't for those ""suckers"", there would not be a game in the first place!

aytutr,A simple script for easily downloading emulator.games roms!,"# Why

[Emulator.Games](https://emulator.games/) is a decent resource to find and download ROMs if you know how to get past their broken download system.

When trying to download ROMs from this site, you are brought to a page with the following countdown: `Your Download is Starting in 30 second(s)`. Unfortunately, at the end of the countdown you are simply greeted with an error saying `This game is unavailable`.

This script updates the `Download Now` button to allow you to immediately download your ROM, skipping the broken download process.

# How to use

Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), then [click here](https://gist.github.com/estelsmith/4aa0b48d2e898f6c363086161b1a5082/raw/b441532bf1093bc9f761ce4328319da1dbe7d977/emulator.games.user.js). Tampermonkey will prompt you to install the script.

That's it!!

When you visit a ROM page, the download link will be changed from `Download Now` to `Download Now (for real)`, indicating the link has been updated.

awhe94,"Piracy is not Stealing, it’s Tax Evasion","I've never heard this line of thinking from anyone else, and I'm quite convinced by it, so please stick through it and give it a shot. 

 

We begin with a reminder that what is illegal is not always unethical. Morality informs the law, but the law does not inform morality. Often we have things that are illegal but not unethical, like a parking violation or jay-walking. We then need to see if piracy also falls into this category.

Piracy is not your average theft. It is intellectual theft, and it is a concept that has been baffling philosophers since the idea came about. 

Intellectual property is not like a chair-maker taking a chair to market, it’s like a chair-maker designing a chair and selling the design potentially an infinite amount of times. The chair-maker’s compensation exists in order to bring that chair design to market, not to ensure he is compensated for each use. 

Copyright law exists to create an incentive for people to write books, film movies, record music, and so on. We decided that we valued art and that it would be better to have more of it. This is very important, so hear this clearly: copyright law exists to incentivize an artist to bring their art to market. That’s it. Everything we have in place is simply *a way* of reaching that goal, but is not necessarily the only way or the best way to reach that goal.  

On a market without copyright law, someone trying to sell digital music is like someone trying to sell air. It is so outrageously plentiful that it is worthless. If we think about it, digital music is worthless. Anything that is infinitely plentiful is. The only reason that it has a dollar tag on it, is a method to incentivize its very existence. We are only using capitalism as a means of producing music. We might instead pay taxes that fund artists directly, and they in turn produce art. The reason we don’t do this is because we, presumably, believe that the production of art is done more efficiently if we leave it up to the market. It rewards good (or at least popular) art, and doesn’t bad. 

The market for digital music is one that we have artificially created in order to ensure its very existence. As such, we can think of the price we pay for digital music as a use-tax, a toll tax, that goes towards our governmentally determined endowment of the arts. So, instead of music piracy being called stealing, it’s more accurate to call it tax evasion. 

The issue is that, unlike a toll road where we can calculate how much a single use comes out to in cost and charge correspondingly, the price for digital entertainment is determined by the market and we don’t know if the per use tax is too high or too low. 

Remember that the goal is to create an incentive strong enough so that artists choose to produce their art instead of getting some other job. That’s it. So, it’s quite possible that we are rewarding more money to the entertainment industry than is necessary to bring about its existence. Recall the chair example. It is absolutely not necessary that the designer of the chair get paid each time someone uses his design. In fact, it’s unheard of for anyone to get continually paid for labor they completed in the past. There is no substantial difference between a construction worker clocking 12 hours than there is a chair designer taking 12 hours to design a chair. It’s work in both cases. The difference lies in how their labor is traded in the market. The fact that intellectual property requires legislation for it to even be traded at all actually gives people in that artificially constructed market an advantage. If movies, tv, music, and books *were not* an artificial market, actors, directors, writers, and musicians would be paid by the hour, just like everyone else. 

Considering copyright law is a tax, if we the taxpayers were actually getting our money’s worth, we would be paying artists by the hour or the year for their work. Pop stars would only be making an average salary and would be in their field largely because they enjoy their work, just like everyone else. But, obviously we have no accountability over artists, so this is not possible. Although, there is a town nearby where I live where two houses are paid for by the town’s taxes, and musicians or painters or whatever are allowed to stay there free of rent so they can focus on their craft. Anyhow, the fact that we have no accountability over artists is not a sufficient reason to simply give up and say that should just be paying them whatever. It would be insane to expect our government to spend and tax us anymore than they need to to bring us their services. 

This is all to say that we are paying way too much for our entertainment. It is insane for a person to take 300 hours to write and record an album, and then continually make millions off it. It is insane for a person to get paid a potentially infinite amount of times for one act of labor. 

The question then becomes, how can we lower the cost of our entertainment while still giving artists incentive to create if we can’t pay them by the hour or year?

For one thing, we simply don’t need music labels. They are a relic of an antiquated system of distributing music with no place in the modern music industry. And yet they take lion’s share of the price you pay to download an album. An estimated 4% to 6% of the price of an album goes towards the actual artist. Labels are still getting paid something like 30% for “breakage,” which used to mean the cost of records being broken in transit. If a musician were paid the same as they already are and we cut out the rest, albums would only cost $1. ($20 x 0.05 = $1) OK, we still need some form of distribution who would be taking their cut, so maybe a little more than that. This could be something like Bandcamp where the site takes a reasonable share instead of all of it. 

I pirate because music is grossly overpriced. I pirate because I don’t want to give my money to anyone other than the artist. But, I do want to give the artist compensation for their work, and I do at their merchandise booth (where musicians get nearly 100% of the cut), I do on their pantheon pages, and I do on bandcamp. But the sad fact is that the majority of artists out there are not set up to cater to the fans that want to contribute through alternative means, so we are left leeching more often than not. 

Make no mistake that piracy is *not* a fair exchange. But do not think that the alternative is a fair one either. I hope that in the future, it becomes easier to support artists directly. An artist saying, “torrent my work and give me a $1 donation,” would be a great thing. But, requiring us to circumvent the system as a solution demonstrates that the system *is not working*.

av3fis,[PSA] Unlimited Google Drive/OneDrive Accounts,"Hi, I used to administrate both Office 365 and G Suite environments.

I've seen a lot of posts on here recently asking what unlimited cloud storage accounts to buy and is it safe etc.

I want to explain what the place you're buying these accounts from can and cannot see.

# Google

These are G Suite unlimited accounts. These work by someone buying G Suite for their ""Organisation"" and creating user accounts for their staff (you).

When you sign in and use the account, it's just like a normal Google account.

The administrator can see how much space you've used, but they cannot see your files.

They can reset your password and log in as you to see your files. Obviously, this removes your access and you lose the account.

But what if I have 2 factor auth enabled? It doesn't matter. They can remove 2FA from your account, reset your password and they're in.

# OneDrive

OneDrive accounts are just user accounts in Office 365. Like G Suite, an admin creates an account for their staff (you).

Administrators can see your files at any time without you knowing. They can copy, edit or remove them as they wish too.

Again, they can reset your password at any time and take the account from you.

# Is it worth getting one of these accounts?

Now that's up to you. Chances are you'll be fine, but bear in mind the account can disappear at any moment and you'll probably never get it back.

It's a terrible idea to store personal information in the accounts. You don't know who could be looking at it.

Feel free to ask questions

EDIT: As recommended by /u/Tardlard, you can encrypt and upload content if you already have an account.

arx3wj,Possible Spotify ad-block detection method I noticed in latest versions that isn't present in older versions,"So some of you know that Spotify have updated their TOS about using Ad Blockers, and they claim they have found ways to detect when ads are getting blocked.

Anyway, I noticed something in more recent versions of Spotify that might hint at that:

So, on latest versions of Spotify (Windows with the HOSTS method), when I start Spotify up,  the **first** song I play will refuse to play and give an error at the top, but selecting a second song (and then going back to the first one I wanted to play) will play as normal.

I downgraded my Spotify to (1.0.84.344) and this **does NOT** happen on this version at all. All songs play normally.

My theory is, on the latest versions, they try and play ad or something that might connect to an ad server before you begin your session which tells Spotify if you're blocking ads or not, and by getting the error confirms that Spotify might know you're blocking the ad.


Just my thought anyway.

arlmop,How did you all end up getting into piracy?,"TL;DR Excessive DRM on movies forced me to pirate because it is almost impossible to play 4k movies.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it was because I just wanted to watch a fucking movie and I couldn't do it legally.

So, I started going to the cinema again and enjoying movies. I want to watch some movies in Blu-Ray because DVDs are bad quality. I buy a Blu-Ray drive and some Blu-Rays, was around £45 for the drive and £30 in Blu-Rays, I've supported the industry, now I want to wat- oh, you can't watch Blu-Rays without special software? Alright, sure. I look into it and see there's a plugin for VLC to play 4K content. Doesn't really work. I see free software that also does this, but there are watermarks when it actually works. Eventually, I torrent Cyberlink PowerDVD because it's like £100. I've already paid £45 for the ability to watch it, why do I need to pay over twice that for software to watch it? Seriously? After torrenting the software I've bought many Blu Rays and watched many movies legally, I only pirated a few and made a point of not pirating wherever possible and purchasing good movies to support the industry. Also made it a point to not pirate games to support the devs, never have pirated a game.

Fast forward to today. 4K TV, alright, I may as well try some 4k Blu Rays. Yeah, it's never that simple, is it? I want to pay movie makers for their movie to watch at home, but I can't do this.  I bought a 4K BD-XL reading-capable drive, cost £70. Alright, sure. I get it, 4K is a new fad. When Oculus came out, VR was expensive, sure.

So I buy two movies, really excited to watch them. Prepared pizza dough and marinaded chicken to make a small feast to watch movies with, wanted to cook some 10/10 food, decided to test it out and make sure it works whilst the dough rises. Bam. My GTX 970 doesn't support HEVC 10 bit, HDCP 2.2 (apparently) and I don't have Intel SGX installed. Alright, alright. So apparently it looks like I need a new graphics card. To be fair, needed a new one for a while. GTX 1080 on eBay, bid almost ending, its a ROG STRIX one so 1933MHz, that's pretty good. Buy it because the bid was almost over and I had no time for further research. Even if it turns out I can't use it, oh well, at least I can play on my Oculus Rift at higher graphics settings.

... so apparently to watch 4K blu-rays with the legit software that came with the UHD drive I bought (Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 BDXL in Media Suite 10), I don't need just these codecs and HDCP 2.2. Oh no, I need Intel SGX supported on every piece of hardware involved for a handshake between the CPU and Intel SGX. Only some select Intel CPUs have this. Alright, luckily, thank fuck, my CPU is on that list. I can't install Intel SGX (basically DRM software) on it, so I have to use the iGPU on the CPU to even watch shit, so didn't really need the GPU upgrade to even watch stuff in the end.

Yeah, screw it. The average end-user shouldn't have to jump through this many hoops to watch the movie they bought. Look, I just want to watch the damn movies I bought. But because Hollywood has nothing but loathing and contempt for people who want to support them, I have to rely on pirates to crack the stuff and post the movies online.

&amp;#x200B;

C'mon man, I just want to watch for what I paid for. Why must I be forced to pirate stuff?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/arlmop/how_did_you_all_end_up_getting_into_piracy/,1550418107.0,716,0.93,738,Piracy,Toofluffles

## LAST UPDATE:

February *2nd, 2019*

 

 

Below is a reworked guide I made based on the other reddit post titled: [\[Updated Tools\] Easy to follow beginner's guide for DeDRMing amazon trial, rental, and purchased eBooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/4bvsnz/updated_tools_easy_to_follow_beginners_guide_for/); which was written by r/coralrabbit.  Hopefully this will help some of you out there.  Especially with the new school semesters starting and the high cost of school books these days.

 

*Don't get put off or intimidated by all the steps.  I made it a lot of steps so I could be as specific as possible to reduce any chance of a mistake.  I wrote this as though I was explaining it to a 5 year old and do not assume any of you should know how to do any of this. I check my reddit mail often so if you have a question please leave a comment!*

 

You can view the original reddit thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/4bvsnz/updated\_tools\_easy\_to\_follow\_beginners\_guide\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/4bvsnz/updated_tools_easy_to_follow_beginners_guide_for/)

 

\*I have updated some of the steps to reflect the changes *(such as icon appearances)* in the most recent version of [Calibre v2.82](http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows).

 

 

              - Guide to Copy, Convert, and Save Kindle Content to PDF using Calibre -
    
    
             Easy-to-Follow Beginner's Guide to DeDRMing Amazon Trial and Purchased eBooks.

 

For starters, I will describe to you the type of books you can DeDRM *(remove blocking restrictions)*.

The categories include:

* **Purchased Versions**
* **Trial Versions** *might not be all pages*
* **Rental Books** *in most versions*
* **Sample Versions** *good for testing if book is actually supplied as an .azw3 or .azw4*

 

This method works best with ***.azw4*** file types.

 

 

                                    - The Required Tools -

 

* **Calibre**

[http://calibre-ebook.com/download\_windows](http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows) *(""NEWEST Version of Calibre"")*

*\*Calibre Version 2.21 Download Link* [here](https://download.calibre-ebook.com/2.21.0/)

---

Calibre is an eBook management tool that is used for the conversion of eBooks in various formats to other formats. It can open most files, but is slow when compared to programs such as Adobe Digital Editions when trying to open .epub books to read.  The current version should work, however, **I am using the older version of Calibre 2.21**. If You follow these steps to the point and it does not work for you, consider uninstalling Calibre and installing the older version.

 

* **Kindle for PC**

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download)

*\*Kindle for PC v1.17* [*here*](http://filehippo.com/download_kindle_for_pc/69970/)

*\*Older versions of* ***Kindle for Mac*** [*here*](https://kindle-mac.en.uptodown.com/mac/old)

---

Kindle for PC is Amazon's official kindle book reader for PC. It allows you to read books downloaded from Amazon's store that are in the .azw4 format. You will need it to download the books that you wish to DeDRM.

**IMPORTANT!** I've been PMed by other users that **Kindle for PC 1.17** is the LAST version that still downloads .azw4 files *(the files that Calibre uses best)*.  If you are having issues get that version *(link above)* or an OLDER version. Make sure to TURN OFF AUTO UPDATES!

 

* **DeDRM Plugin \[NEW\]**

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/3y3r9z2bk8c71t1/DeDRM\_plugin.zi](http://www.mediafire.com/download/3y3r9z2bk8c71t1/DeDRM_plugin.zi)

---

This plugin allows your version of Calibre to DeDRM Amazon's .azw4 files. For that reason, it is not allowed in Calibre's official plugin download tool. You must download this .zip file and use Calibre to load the plugin from it. This particular download is pre-modified, meaning that you do not have to edit any code for this plugin to function. *Note: unzipping the tool does nothing for you. It is my suggestion that you leave it as is.*

## PART 1:

## Setting Up Your Amazon Account, Kindle for PC and Calibre with DeDRM Plugin

---

***Most of PART 1 you will only have to do ONCE.  Every other time you can skip to PART 2***

 

**1)**	Download and install Calibre and Kindle for PC on your device.

 

**2)**	Login or create an account on Amazon.com. *I would suggest that this not be your personal account that you use to buy things with normally.*

 

**3)**	Log in to the same account on your Kindle for PC app.

 

**4)**	Pick the book that you want to strip the DRM from.

 

**5)**	Select the *""try free""* or *""7-Day Trial""* button, whichever you see. If you can't get the full book free via Kindle then you can purchase the book and return it for a full (and instant) refund after you make your copy with Calibre.

 

**6)**	Click the pull down menu, and select *""Your name's Kindle for PC""* as the device. *If your device does not appear, I would suggest reviewing* [*this*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201216000)*. I often find that I am not logged in the same account on both the web browser and the PC, and this results in the issue.*

 

**7)**	Allow the Amazon application to be launched. *On my chrome browser, I am given a prompt in which I click ""Launch application.""*

 

**8)**	Make sure your book is downloaded. This can be found by opening the Kindle app and clicking the *""downloaded""* section. You might have to open it once in order for it to load. If your book is in this section, and displays a red bar with white text saying *""x days left of trial,""* then the book is downloaded. If it does not appear, it may be likely that you sent it to the wrong device. In this situation, *(if using a trial book)* you would have to make a new account entirely to access the trial again, as Amazon only seems to like allowing one device to have the trial.

 

**9)**	Open Calibre. Ignore any welcoming stuff it may have for you, as it's unnecessary to learn about the program at this point.

 

**10)**	Click on the double arrows that appear next to *""Remove Books""*. *Depending on your screen size, they may be placed differently or may not exist at all.*

 

**11)**	Click the preferences icon that has a crew and wrench icon. *(You might have to scroll all the way to the right with the double arrows on the top right of the screen to see this)*

 

**12)**	Scroll down and click the green puzzle piece icon labelled *""Plugins""*.

 

**13)**	Click the yellow puzzle piece icon that says *""Get New Plugins”*.

 

**14)**	Click on the *“Kindle Unpack”* plugin, and click install.

 

**15)**	Give it confirmation on anything it prompts you with.  *If it asks you, have it loaded onto the: navigation &gt; favorites &gt; plugin bar.*

 

**16)**	Download the DeDRM plugin linked in the instructions, if you haven't already.

 

**17)**	Once again, access the preferences as in step 11.  This time choose the option *""Change Calibre Behavior""*.

 

**18)**   Click on the green puzzle icon named *""Plugins""* in the bottom left under *""Advanced""*

 

**19)**   On the bottom right of this next screen you'll see an option that says *""Load plugin from file""*. Click that and browse to the DeDRM plugin.

 

**20)**	Confirm and accept any warnings it gives *(don't worry about any virus warnings, this is hack tool after all!)*.

 

**21)**	Once it is installed, close Calibre, and then open it again.

## PART 2:

## DeDRMing and Converting to a Savable PDF

---

***After you have successfully completed the initial program downloads and setup for the first time, you can get any book from Amazon and SKIP PART 1***

 

**1)**	Open your Windows Explorer, and go to */documents/mykindlecontent*. *If you correctly downloaded the book, the* ***.azw4*** *file should be here. The name will be random and alphanumeric, and as far as I know, starting with the letter B.*

 

**2)**	Go to Calibre. Copy the ***.azw4*** from the folder to Calibre by dragging the file to the Calibre window.

 

**3)**	**Congratulations! You've DeDRMed an Amazon book.** ***But you're not done yet...***

 

**4)**	Click the book you just imported so it is highlighted in blue.

 

**5)**	Click the arrows in the top right corner *(as you did previously)* and there should be a new icon *(shaped like a yellow triangle with rounded edges)* labelled *""Kindle Unpack""*. *You might have to click the right arrow near all the icons to scroll to it.  It is usually the last icon.*

 

**6)**	Click the yellow triangle icon. *If your book was successfully DeDRMed, there will be a green unlocked selection. If the DeDRM was unsuccessful, it will be red. If it is red, figure out what you did wrong, check the FAQ section in this guide, and/or repeat the above steps until successful.*

 

**7)**	Click the green unlocked icon and click *""extract pdf""*. The ***.azw4*** will then be converted to a PDF.

 

**8)**	Right click the book you just converted in Calibre, and click *""open containing folder""*. This is the location of your PDF.

 

**9)**	Once you have confirmed the PDF is working properly you can then go back to Amazon and refund the book.  This will remove it from your Kindle library. Remember the CONVERTED book will always be in your Calibre library.

# How to Refund Your Money AFTER Downloading and Converting the Kindle Book

---

***This section will explain how to get your money back so you are left with a PDF of the book without spending any money***

 

**1)**	Once you have confirmed your conversion worked, sign into Amazon in your browser.

 

**2)**	On the top-right of the website click on the drop down list ***""Account &amp; Lists""***

 

**3)**	Under ***""Your Account""*** select ***""Your Content and Devices""***.

 

**4)**	You will see a list of any DIGITAL purchases you made. Next to the eBook click the check box.  Under ***""Actions""*** click the ... box.  This will open a small window where you can select the option ***""Return for Refund""***.  *I usually choose the refund reason as ""wrong book"" but it doesn't matter what reason you choose.*

 

**5)**	Once this is clicked the eBook will be removed from you Kindle folder *(don't worry your Calibre folder and files are not touched)* and your money will be instantly refunded!

&amp;nbsp;

**6)** If you are being asked to contact customer service to complete your refund, refer to the question in the FAQ titled: *When refunding the book I'm being asked to contact customer service. What should I do?* 

&amp;nbsp;

*Please check the comments below in case anyone has already asked your question or provided additional information that might help :)*

***Feel Free to PM me if this post becomes archived (and you can't find an answer in this FAQ section)***

 

### **Q:** ***I can not get .azw4 files and/or convert with Calibre***

---

**A:** Another user PMed me stating that the NEWEST versions of Kindle for PC and Calibre are breaking capability with .azw4 files (the file type needed to DeDRM successfully). The solution to this is to download the OLDER version of Calibre (v2.21) and Kindle for PC (v1.17).  Links for both of these are at the TOP of this guide.

If you already have the NEWER versions simply uninstall them then install the older ones.  This guide was based on the older versions anyway.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:** ***Does this work on Mac?***

---

**A:** Yes. According to PM's I've received from other users they have been able to successfully use this on Mac OS as well as PC.

You might need to use an older version of Kindle for Mac depending on what changes are made to the most current version.

Here is a link to ALL versions of kindle for Mac:  [https://kindle-mac.en.uptodown.com/mac/old](https://kindle-mac.en.uptodown.com/mac/old)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:** ***My file is converting to something other than a PDF?!***

---

**A:** People have been replying that some of their files have not converted to a PDF or any format at all.  This is because ***.azw4*** files *(the file you get from amazon when you get a kindle book)* are currently the only one guaranteed to convert to a PDF. An ***.azw4*** file is nothing more then a PDF wrapped in DRM protection. ***.azw3*** files usually work however they tend to only convert to ePub files in which you'll need to convert those to a PDF. This is because they are nothing more then epub files wrapped in DRM protection.

To convert the formats of the file you can use the ""Convert"" tool within the Calibre program itself or find a free online ePub to PDF converter like this one [here](http://www.convertfiles.com/convert/ebook/EPUB-to-PDF.html).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:** ***Do I need to spend money for this?***

---

**A:** ***Yes***, ***but just until you refund it back when finished converting the book***. Sometimes you can do this using the *""7-day Trial""* option. However **BUYING** the book always works.  If you are buying the book you will need to use a credit/debit/gift card.  You should have one on file anyway because you can't make an Amazon account without one.

If you complete the entire process from purchase to &gt; converting to &gt; refund in less then an hour you will not even be charged. The sale will still be pending and then will just get cancelled. If it takes longer or you choose a book that is only available from a Non-Amazon seller it could take a couple of days for the refund to process.

Make sure you have enough money on your card to **TEMPORARILY** cover the cost of the book. **YOU CAN** ***ALWAYS*** **REFUND** ***ANY*** **EBOOK ON AMAZON!** There is no way to screw this up! Either you convert it to a PDF or it doesn't work, either way Amazon always accepts the refund and deletes the eBook from your kindle folder.

As far as Amazon is concerned you just made a mistake and bought the wrong book. It's not a physical item and *(as far as they know)* you can't even read it without their Kindle; so they have no problem instantly removing it from your account and returning your money.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:** ***All the books I'm downloading aren't converting at all!***

---

**A:**  There are a few possible reasons/solutions to this:

 

* It could be an issue with Calibre: try downloading the older version (v2.21) I posted in the top of the guide.
* It could be an issue with Kindle for PC: try downloading the older version (v1.17) I posted in the top of the guide. *Then turn off auto updates in: tools &gt; options &gt; general*
* Check if there is a newer version of the DeDRM plugin available. It's possible it has updated since I posted this.
* It could be some issue with the installation. To start fresh you can try uninstalling Kindle AND Calibre, then reinstalling and following the steps to set up the plugin again.
* Finally you might just be getting unlucky and the books you're choosing are indeed only available as ***.azw*** files and NOT available as ***.azw3*** or ***.azw4*** files.

**Here is a trick that was suggested by reddit user** r/mortymertens **to check ahead of time if your book will be in azw3 or azw4 format:**

&gt;*Heads up, I found out that you can check if the book is going to be a AZW3 (ePub) or AZW4 (PDF) before you purchase it. Just select the ""send a free sample option"" that is usually located under the ""buy/rent now with 1-click"" button. Do the same thing with the sample as you would do with the real kindle book and drag it to Calibre. Calibre will then tell you if its an AZW3 or AZW4. This way you can screen the book before you decide to purchase and return it. I've tried this with known AZW3 and AZW4 books. Let me know if there is a better of checking this before purchasing the book.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*edit: This is different than the ""7-day free trial"" option mentioned in the guide. The sample is just a few pages from the book, and is usually on just about every kindle book. It is NOT the whole thing, but the format (AZW3 vs 4) is consistent with the real book.*

 

If *(after you download and convert it)*, **the process works fine**, then that might be evidence that you are just getting unlucky and choosing books that happen to ONLY BE AVAILABLE in the ***.azw*** format.  **IF IT DOES NOT WORK** then it means you need to try one of the above solutions.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:** ***When refunding the book I'm being asked to contact customer service. What should I do?***

---

**A:**  Several people have PMed me about this along with their outcome.  This ""extra"" step seems to be a way to discourage people from refunding books either because they get ""scared"" or are too lazy to go forward with the refund process.  However, each person who contacted me about this said they contacted customer service and gave them some excuse for why it needs to be refunded *(i.e. wrong edition, wrong book, impulse buy, dropped the class, etc.)* and EVERYONE has received their refund.

I'm sure for every 1 person who goes through the refund process, 10 more don't. Congratulations, the companies found another way to profit. You can even use different Amazon accounts for each purchase if you don't want to refund several books at once from one account *(or say you dropped out of school and need to refund all your books)*. Don't get scared, they're nice on the phone and as soon as you give them ANY reason for a refund they'll refund it no questions asked. I've done this with other items from Amazon and it's always been a pleasant and seamless process.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

### **Q:**  ***Is this illegal and/or could I get in any trouble or have my account suspended?***

---

**A:**  **No, this is not illegal!** You are **buying** the book. Then you are making a backup copy for yourself that has had the DRM protection removed so you can use an alternate viewer then Kindle to read it. That is the reason why this DeDRM technology was created.  However, it IS illegal to try and sell those copies for profit.  **DON'T BE A DICK, DO NOT SELL YOUR COPIES!**

To be extra safe, it is suggested in this guide *(and I will reiterate it here)* to **MAKE A NEW AMAZON ACCOUNT**.  Do not use your primary Amazon account. You can but it is bad practice.  I was contacted by 2 or 3 people who had their account suspended and they all had **1 thing in common**: All of them got greedy and tried to download then return SEVERAL books at the same time.  DON'T BE THAT GUY/GIRL *(or person that sexually identifies as a helicopter)*!  If you need several books spread out your purchase and returns over several days. Alternatively you can make additional Amazon accounts and use each one to only purchase/return 1-2 books.  You can have as many accounts as you want, they just need to be linked to different email address.
